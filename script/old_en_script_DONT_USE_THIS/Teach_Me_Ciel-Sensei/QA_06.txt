OS. OS. OS.
Phew.
<Page2>
I've been pressing the O and S keys for 20 hours now.
With all this typing, I could have developed an app by now.
<Page3>
Phew... nothing like a coffee after work.
I can even feel the end of work from the atmosphere alone.
<Page4>
Now then, as for this morning's dead end...
Ahh, a direct hit from the enemy I see.
<Page5>
Glasses-kun, could this be...
an attempt to reincarnate into another world?
<Page6>
(How on earth is she pressing the keys with those hands?)
I see...
<Page7>
Since it was as if you had pulled a dump truck onto yourself,
it could be said that this incidient was caused by carelessness.
<Page8>
However, it could also be due to the bad influence from that vampire.
<Page9>
I mean, if you had a unit like an excavator next to you,
it's only human nature to want to use it.
<Page10>
How is that human nature?
And don't call her a unit. It's heroine. Heroine.
<Page11>
They're basically the same.
In fact, they do the same thing.
<Page12>
Jeez. It's not like you at all to act
so freely without considering the consequences.
<Page13>
Were you feeling dizzy from all the damage you took?
<Page14>
Nyah. Wasn't he just overly happy
from being relied on so much?
<Page15>
---I see.
I hope you get kicked to death by a horse.
<Page16>
It seems that half of the blame goes to Tohno-kun
and the other half of the blame goes to Arcueid.
<Page17>
This is no time for playing around.
The climax is right in front of you.
<Page18>
This time, try to choose the option that will
get you as far away from Arcueid as possible!
<Page19>
Ehh~~.
If it was you in that situation, you would have done the same nya~.
<Page20>
Hehe. No way, absolutely not.
I don't have that kind of muscle strength after all.

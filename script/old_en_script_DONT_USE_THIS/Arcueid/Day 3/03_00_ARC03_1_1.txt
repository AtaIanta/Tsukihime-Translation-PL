"Hey. Good morning, Akiha.
At any rate, I decided to greet Akiha first.
<Page2>
"...... Good morning, Nii-san.
I don't see any energy in your greeting, did you sleep well last night? You look like you're about to collapse.
<Page3>
 "Unfortunately, that's my face. Don't expect me to greet you with high spirits in the morning."
I'm not sure what happened last night, but I don't want people to think I'm a juvenile delinquent who stays up late.
<Page4>
"Good morning Shiki-san.
If you'd like breakfast, I can serve it in the cafeteria, so please feel free to ask me anytime."
Kohaku, on the other hand, has this healing power. The north wind and the sun.
<Page5>
"Thank you very much.
But, has Akiha already finished? It looks like it's tea after breakfast."
<Page6>
"Of course. I don't care what time you wake up, but at least make sure you have enough time for breakfast.
Having breakfast after seven o'clock is a sign of sluggishness.
<Page7>
　I resisted the urge to say, "No, 7 o'clock is normal. This house is not normal to begin with."
<Page8>
"Hmm. What time do you get up, Akiha?
"I get up at five o'clock, what about it?
"...... I'm sorry"
I' m not sure if it's strange or not. It's a little too much for me.
I've never heard such a perfect answer.
<Page9>
What did you mean by "I'm sorry"?
"No, nothing..... But what are you doing up so early? To not be late?"
<Page10>
"You know what?. I'm never late unless there's a big problem.
Nii-san's school is about an half hour walk from here, right? It's not far, so please don't be late. It's embarrassing."
<Page11>
　The thorns are really sharp and prickly.
However, all the arguments are correct, and I can't think of any counterarguments.
It's natural for Akiha to be concerned about the reputation of the Tohno family, but as the head of the family, it's her duty to fulfill.
<Page12>
"Yeah, yeah. I'll try not to be late, regardless of my grades.
And staying up late..."
As I said this, I remembered what had happened last night.
I don't want to stay up late, but it's the same if there are external factors that make me lose sleep.

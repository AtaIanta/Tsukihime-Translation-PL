I walked to school a little later than usual.
By the time I saw the main gate, it was almost 7 am.
Students on their way to club activities were hurrying past the main gate.
They must be trying to use up the limited time they have until 8 am, the start of homeroom.
<Page2>
Tokyo Metropolitan Souya High School.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the old building.
It is an average high school with a moderate rate of advancement and extra curricular participation as well as reasonably loose school rules.
<Page3>
The only complaint from the male students is a very common one: "Please improve the outdated uniform design."
On the other hand, the female students' uniform was changed three years ago.
The school thought that the number of applicants would decrease if they had to wear the old-fashioned sailor uniforms, so they did the best they could to compromise.
<Page4>
"Hmm……?"
I felt a faint sense of discomfort in the familiar scenery.
This morning was somewhat hectic.
<Page5>
Teachers were running to the staff room with pale faces.
There was a black car parked in the parking lot that I had never seen before.
The sky was bleak.
For some reason, I associate it with a funeral scenery.
<Page6>
...I sigh at my dark thoughts.
I decided to shake off my unpleasant premonition and head to the classroom.
<Page7>
I enter the empty classroom.
I sit down in my chair and kill time until the morning homeroom.
As I did my prep work with an auspicious attitude, the class began to fill with people.
<Page8>
"Good morning. Today's morning practice is over."
"Huh, you were pretty fast to arrive, Tohno."
"Oh, that's right, volunteers!"
"But was it actually today? Oh no, I might have skipped it!"
<Page9>
In 2-C, the students get along better than in other classrooms.
They greet each other the moment they meet and then sit in their own seats.
<Page10>
The students who finished their club activities are talking with the rest.
Everything ranging from last night's Internet news, which has been consumed to the point where there is no room for debate, to the new information about school that happened just ten minutes ago is being discussed.
<Page11>
It might be just simple idle talk to kill time, but it's a necessary part of our routine.
It's a light warmup before the day begins.
In this day and age of information overload, it would be exhausting for both us and the other person if we were to engage in serious dialogue all the time.
<Page12>
The atmosphere in the classroom suddenly changed.
What used to be a harmonious chat has turned into a whispering voice.
<Page13>
"Hey, don't block the road, assholes.
It's early in the morning and you're already swarming in and blocking the way."
The sharp words reverberated in the classroom, as if to ignore the fact that classmates are present.
I don't need to see it to confirm it. The atmosphere in the classroom has changed because of the arrival of this―――
<Page14>
"Cheeeeese! Gummonin' glasses-kun!
You look so bitter this morning, you look like a piece of shit!"
"..............."
It is the fault of this delinquent student who have strayed from the idyllic colors of our school.
<Page15>
"Hey, where's the greeting?
People are unusually coming to see you in the morning, and you don't even say hello? In fact, don't you at least say thank you for being here since morning?"
<Page16>
"No, I don't. It's just that I'm disappointed to see your thick face in the morning.
I'm not saying thank you. I didn't come to school for you."
<Page17>
"What? Don't be ridiculous! I'm at school for you! That's not fair!"
"................."
I'm speechless.
Sometimes I wonder why I'm his best friend.
<Page18>
Orange dyed hair, ear piercing.
He wears an anti-social attire that gives a bad image, as if he is ready to fight with anyone at any time.
In this day and age when the culture of delinquent students has died out, he is a free spirited outlaw who sells his violence.
That's him, Inui Arihiko.
<Page19>
"...Well, okay . It's good to come to class in the morning.
Good morning, Arihiko. Are you finally starting to care about your attendance?"
<Page20>
"No, I'm not worried about that. There's still plenty of time for that.
I've got my sister at home today, so I just can't slack off.
I've been working all night, and I'm at the end of my rope."
"I see. I'm sorry, let me redo my greeting.
Good night, Asshiko. Hurry up to your desk and get some sleep."
<Page21>
"Gee, what a cold reaction.
That's your attitude toward your rival from middle school? Can't you be more passionate about it!?"
<Page22>
"...... Why do you and I have to be rivals?
If you want to live an unprincipled life, find some like-minded people on the street. Don't bother me too much."
No, I've lent him almost 10,000 yen since junior high school and he hasn't given it back, so if you say he's a foreign enemy, you are right.
<Page23>
"I'm not sure why you're so cold only to me.
You're like a saint to everyone else, isn't it unfair?"
"You know what I'm talking about.
There's nothing fair about the world."
<Page24>
"That's true, but...
But aren't you especially cold to me?"
<Page25>
Arihiko sighs exaggeratedly.
It wasn't that I was being consciously cold to him, it was just that we had naturally come to this distance as a result of our mutual frankness without hesitation.
Although our interests and tastes are different, we are on the same wavelength somehow, I guess.
<Page26>
"...... Well, it's okay that you ran away from home.
You're usually a night owl, so how can you be expected to attend in the morning?
It's a bit, well, quite unusual."
<Page27>
"Yeah, I guess so too.
Just because you happen to be awake doesn't mean you should come to school. Honestly, I want to go home. Hmm, do students really need to have the motivation to study?"
<Page28>
That's exactly right, but when this man says it, I feel that it's admirable just to come to school even if you don't have the will.
<Page29>
"You can discuss that with the mirror next time you're free.
What I want to ask you is why you don't go to the city. Wouldn't karaoke or a manga cafe be a better way to kill time?"
"That's the thing. It's getting real dangerous out here these days.
I'm not breaking into a fight scene for free, and I'd only show up if I had the energy to begin with."
<Page30>
"Dangerous...?"
"Oh? You haven't heard?
I'm talking about the street muder case that's been getting a lot of publicity. There are cops patrolling the center street in front of the station at night."
"...Right. I did hear a story like that."
<Page31>
Arihiko reminded me of it.
The house I was staying at until yesterday was a few stations away from here, so the incidents around Souya station were somewhat foreign to me.
It should've been all over the news.
If I recall correctly―――
<Page32>
"What was it again? I know it was like a really vulgar sales pitch."
"The Midnight Street Killer Incidents, right?"
<Page33>
"A series of bizarre murders. The victims were usually young women, and a monk, who was found two days ago, was the eighth. All of them have cross-shaped scars on their throats, too."
What the hell?
I can't even imagine a situation like that.
<Page34>
"That's wrong, Inui-kun. All the people killed lost a significant amount of blood."
<Page35>
I'm not sure if we were talking too loudly, but Yumizuka, who was nearby, popped up and corrected him.
<Page36>
"Ah, right, right. It looked like a modern day vampire, didn't it?
Thanks, Yumizuka, good morning!"
<Page37>
"Good morning to you too, Inui-kun.
Oh, also, the trauma varies from person to person, with some having no scars at all and others having severe damage... I think."
<Page38>
"You know a lot, don't you, Yumizuka-san?"
"N-no, I don't!
It's a major case happening in this city, and if you watch the news, you're bound to remember it!"
<Page39>
"Well, that's how it is, Tohno.
Even for me, going out at night while there's a serial killer around is too much. I've been staying up late at home these days."
<Page40>
"Oh, so that's your reason?
I'm surprised you're so sane. It's not like you to stay at home scared of a murderer."
<Page41>
"It's not that strange, most people are scared of murderers.
Surprise attacks only go so far when there’s a killer hot on your trail, and I’m not going out of my way to do that. Sorry, but hell no. I’m not throwing away my life just yet."
"...... Oh, I see. You're right, if you're targeted, you'll have to fight to the bitter end."
<Page42>
"Woah there. Can't you just choose to run away?
Why do you have to fight to the death?"
"What? Escape isn't an option, right?"
<Page43>
"Right, I was an idiot for asking you.
Actually, I don't care about the murderer either. You know, those are natural disasters, right? It's bad luck to run into them.
The reason I don't go out into the city is more practical. Lately, there's been a new bunch of idiots in front of the north exit. To be honest, I don't even want to see their faces."
<Page44>
In front of the north gate at the station... is a downtown area opposite the office district, and at night it's bustling with lots of people and traffic.
Arihiko also lives near the north gate, so if he's avoiding these "new idiots", they must be a pretty dangerous group indeed.
<Page45>
"Haven't you heard of them?
It's like a test of courage. You go into an underground passage through a secret entrance, and if you make it to the end, you win a lot of money."
<Page46>
"I've heard of that too, but... isn't it just a ghost story?"
<Page47>
"Well, it's been an urban legend for a long time. 
Those idiots have gone in and tried to turn it into some kind of scam. I don't know where they came from, but there's a terrible atmosphere around the north gate now.  The slightest thing can kick off a fistfight."
<Page48>
"Basically, I don't want to injure myself, right? If they keep being so brazen, the police will step in soon, so I'll just stay indoors for a while until they're caught. "
<Page49>
The urban legend of the north entrance... Unfortunately, I am not a local, so it is unfamilar to me. 
After today, it won't be a strange thing to me anymore...I think.
<Page50>
"Hey, what's with the lack of response?
Something wrong? Did you collapse from anemia this morning?"
<Page51>
"No, I'm fine this morning.
It's nice of you to worry about me, but my body wouldn't be able to take it if I'm that anemic all the time."
"Alright. If you say you're okay, then you must be."
<Page52>
"Come on, class is about to start. Get back to your seat and go to sleep."
"Alright. ...Oh, yeah. Today's lunch will be in the cafeteria. I've invited a special guest to surprise you, so look forward to it."
<Page53>
Laughing as if he was planning something, Arihiko went back to his seat.
<Page54>
"See you later, Tohno-kun."
"Ah, yes. I'm sorry for making you accompany me, Yumizuka-san."
With a quick, light step, Yumizuka returned to her seat.
<Page55>
Five minutes after the bell announcing the start of homeroom, our teacher, Tohyama-sensei, still had not arrived. 
Just as homeroom was about to end, the teacher next door came and announced that Tohyama-sensei was absent.
<Page56>
"Woohoo! Today's math class is self study!"
Someone in the class shouted in victory.
<Page57>
Tohyama-sensei is the math teacher.
If she is absent, today's class will be self-study. The rest of the time can be used freely as long as we complete the assigned printouts.
Some students use it to study, some to play.
<Page58>
I started to work on my math problems.
When I was a child, I was told that it would be difficult for me to enter prestigious schools with my body, so I stopped going to cram school in junior high, but studying itself was still interesting.
Whether you go on to higher education or enter the workforce, having knowledge is not a waste.
After solving a few application problems, I looked up and saw the students in the hallway.
<Page59>
Since my seat was far away, I could only hear fragments of their voices.
<Page60>
"I knew it..."
"I can't believe it..."
"During the morning practice, the teachers turned pale as they entered the staff room..."
"It's just a rumor."
"But it's that easy."
"That's terrible, how did that happen?"
I furrow my brow, thinking that the worse my premonition was, the more likely it seemed to come true.
<Page61>
"Yesterday's incident."
"There were two guys in the principal's office who looked like detectives."
I prepared myself for what was to come next.
It's something I'm used to, but I breathe in and wait for the words so that I don't dismiss it as something natural.
<Page62>
"So... Tohyama, I heard she died yesterday."
I close my eyelids gently, as if blocking out my headache.
<Page63>
The rumor of Tohyama-sensei did not spread very far, and the morning class ended without incident.
<Page64>
It is lunchtime, and the classroom is in chaos.
Some were in the cafeteria, some were in the courtyard, and some were still in their classrooms, spreading out their lunches.
Now, where should I have lunch?
C:>I'll meet up with Arihiko at the cafeteria.
C:>I'll stay in the classroom and see what happens.
C:>I'll figure it out in the hallway.

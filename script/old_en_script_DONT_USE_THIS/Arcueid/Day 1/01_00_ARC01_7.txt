<Page1>
In contrast to the white-based living room, the room was a red themed space.
<Page2>
A luxurious curtain. A crimson carpet without a single stain.
The air is heavy and dignified, as if giving the impression of the long history that it contained.
This was the office... of the head of the Tohno family, where Tohno Makihisa used to sit, is now home to Tohno Akiha.
<Page3>
"I have brought Shiki-sama with me."
"Thank you. You can go back to work, Kohaku."
"Yes. If you'll excuse me."
<Page4>
The maid's name is Kohaku, then.
She also gives me a small bow and leaves the room.
The only ones left are myself and two girls I don't recognize.
<Page5>
Kohaku gives a small bow and leaves the room.
The only ones left are myself and two girls I don't recognize.
<Page6>
"It has been a while, brother."
The girl with long black hair says these words with a dignified look in her eyes.
<Page7>
"------"
My mind is completely blank.
My thoughts have stopped entirely.
<Page8>
I can't even say hello to her, barely managing to nod my head.
I feel discouraged at my own pettiness, but I guess it can't be helped.
I haven't seen Akiha in seven years, but she is far from what I remember.
<Page9>
"...Brother? Is there something wrong in this room?"
As if carefully observing the suspicious visitor, the black-haired girl squints faintly.
<Page10>
"Ah, no, no."
My mind hasn't been able to switch over yet, and I can only reply with dumb words.
I'm trying my best to recognize the girl in front of me as Akiha, but she seems to have already recognized me as her brother.
<Page11>
Oh. I heard your physical condition is rather unstable. While it’s time poorly spent, would you rather rest before we talk?"
...And.
Akiha's words seem to have a certain sting to them.
<Page12>
"No, no, I'm okay. I was just surprised at how much you've changed."
<Page13>
"...After seven years, things change. We've been growing up. Or did you think things would stay the same forever, brother?"
"No, it's--"
I'm so overwhelmed by the quiet power of her words that I can't speak.
<Page14>
...Or rather, reflecting on it now.
I hadn't imagined what the Akiha of now would be like.
I didn't think beyond the convenient memories of her that I had as a child.
I wonder how the seven years have made Akiha grow. Ah, but it's too rude to think about this in front of her.
<Page15>
"...I'm sorry. To be honest, I didn't think it through.
But then again, you've changed. You're a lot more beautiful than you used to be."
I give my honest opinion.
<Page16>
"Thank you very much.
Brother, you have not changed much from before, have you?
Akiha says coldly with her eyes closed.
<Page17>
".................."
...Well, I was prepared for this, but...
It seems that Akiha doesn't think well of me after I left the Tohno family.
<Page18>
「........」
「........」
<Page19>
The silence lasts only a few seconds, as each of us try to figure out what the other will do.
I can't think of a casual greeting to say to my sister who I met again.
Akiha is watching me as if I were a stranger, although I suppose I really am a stranger to her.
<Page20>
"...Well, that is fine.
If you are not feeling well, let us finish our conversation.
Have you heard any details about this relocation?"
<Page21>
"No, I don't know anything about it. I just heard that "You should come back to the house." I only read about the death of my father in the newspaper."
<Page22>
When the head of a business group passes away, it is covered in the newspapers.
Even if there is no news from relatives, a disowned son can learn of his parents' death from such sources.
The news of Tohno Makihisa's death was delivered to the Arima family after his funeral, as if I were a stranger.
<Page23>
"...I'm sorry. It was my fault for not informing you about Father."
<Page24>
Akiha quietly bows her head.
Her smooth black hair is beautiful, ...but it's not the time to be admiring it. I shouldn't be thinking about that.
<Page25>
"You don't have to worry about that.
It's not like the dead would have come back to life even if I had come. On the contrary, I'm glad I didn't meet any of my relatives."
Being disowned puts you in a complicated position in many ways.
<Page26>
"...I see.
It makes me feel a little better to hear you say that."
<Page27>
This is where having a quick learner of a sister helps.
A funeral is a ritual for those who can't forget the deceased to lay their feelings to rest.
My father and I have severed our ties long ago.
I can't think of a single reason to say goodbye to Tohno Makihisa. I have neither the right nor the duty to see him off.
<Page28>
"But, then, who brought me back?
It's not like it was in my father's will, was it?"
<Page29>
"It was my decision to bring you back here, brother.
It would be strange for the eldest son of Tohno to be kept in Arima house forever, would it not? No matter what your defects are, you are still a Tohno."
<Page30>
"..............."
The word "defect" came naturally to me.
I've been told that word by my father for years.
I don't feel any dissatisfaction or antipathy at being told this now, and her assessment is absolutely correct.
<Page31>
"Now that father... that Tohno Makihisa is dead, the only ones alive with the Tohno bloodline are you and me, brother.
That blood must be protected.
I do not know what father had in mind when he entrusted you to the Arima family, but he has passed away.
As long as the reason is unknown, it is only natural for the current family to supervise Tohno Shiki here."
<Page32>
Akiha's words are calm, but compelling.
It is as if she is declaring in advance that she won't listen to any of my complaints or protests.
<Page33>
"...Supervision, huh. So what would have happened if I had refused to come back to the Tohno house?"
<Page34>
"You do not have the freedom to decide that. No one from the Arima branch has the right to refuse a decision from the head family.
You and I were both raised by the Tohno family. At least until you reach adulthood and become independent in society, you are obligated to be a slave to the Tohno family."
<Page35>
".................."
That's what Makihisa said too.
Parents have a responsibility to raise their children and send them off as members of society.
<Page36>
The family is just the minimum "company" that constitutes a nation, and as a company, it can't ship defective products.
This doesn't only damage the name of the family, but also lowers the quality of the whole country.
<Page37>
Those who cannot take on that responsibility are not qualified to be parents, and children who cannot live up to that responsibility have no reason to be part of a family.
Makihisa Tohno told this story to me and Akiba many times. It was as if he was reassuring himself, over and over again.
<Page38>
"That's what the old man used to say.
So the reason you called me back is simply..."
It's not for the feelings of her brother who was disowned by her father.
<Page39>
"It is because you are the eldest son of the Tohno family.
Do you not think that is enough of a reason?"
As the head of the Tohno family, she is just cleaning up a matter that had been left unattended.
<Page40>
"I'm glad you understand.
Needless to say, you should take my words as those of the head of the Tohno family. You are my brother in the family register, but the hierarchical relationship in this family is something else."
<Page41>
"I respect you as my brother, but at the same time, as the one who is in charge of this house, I will treat you as the property of the Tohno family.
Please forget about what happened seven years ago and remember that I am the head and you are my family."
<Page42>
Akiha's voice is indifferent.
A decision made from above. It is true that I feel something cold there.
But-
<Page43>
"It's easy to understand.
If you say it clearly like that."
This is a natural outcome.
It's nothing to be upset about.
<Page44>
"...Do you understand my words?
I just unilaterally declared that I'm above you and that you should accept it..."
<Page45>
"I know, and I'm not complaining. It's just that I'm going to be treated this way no matter what I think about it.
In fact, I'm grateful to you for treating me as a brother after I lived for seven years as I pleased."
"....................."
<Page46>
"But regardless of what you think, didn't the relatives object? Weren't they the ones who suggested that I stay at Arima house?"
<Page47>
"Yes, they did. But I am the current head of the family. I rejected all their advice.
I have made it clear that to interfere in this matter is to go against me, and by extension, against the Tohno family."
<Page48>
"------"
I can't help but look at her in amazement.
Even Makihisa couldn't ignore the opinions of the branch families... or, did they convince him out of it?
...No.
She has grown up well in appearance, but I wonder how much she has grown up inside. As an older brother, I'm a little scared of my sister's rapid development.
<Page49>
"...Brother?
Why do you look so puzzled?"
<Page50>
"Oh, no, I'm impressed, or rather, moved... you've really been recognized as the head of the family."
"Of course. Otherwise, I would not be able to call you back, brother."
<Page51>
"Back to the matter at hand.
From today on, you will be living in the mansion, but there are rules and regulations here. You will refrain from misbehaving as you have in the past, so please keep that in mind."
<Page52>
"Huh? Haha, that's impossible, Akiha.
There's no way I can go back to being a well-behaved person now, and I have no intention of trying to either."
<Page53>
"No, you will turn back no matter what.
You're not a child, so do not whine before trying.
Or are you saying that what I can do, you cannot do?"
She glares at me with a cold stare.
<Page54>
"------"
Or rather, her gaze is now like a piercing spear.
"Uh..."
There's no doubt about it. I'm now being mercilessly bombarded with the animosity that has been piling up for seven years...
<Page55>
"...Okay. I'll try as hard as I can."
"You'll try? That is a convenient response.
Do you think that anyone who makes an effort will be rewarded? I'm only looking for results, so please keep that in mind."
<Page56>
"Ugh....."
I'm completely dumbfounded by her not having even a millimeter of kindness.
<Page57>
"...It is fine. You've been living a free and easy life, so I do not expect you to change it immediately.
I'll give you a week at the earliest and a month at the latest, so please make your best effort."
<Page58>
I hold back the thought that this seems more like a grace period than a probation to see how I behave.
Akiha is making a concession in her own way. I'm sure.
<Page59>
"...You know what? It is not that difficult.
You and I are the only ones living in the house now.
It is hard for you to relax with all those noisy relatives around, and it is a nuisance for me too, so I have already sent them away."
<Page60>
"---"
Wait a minute... You don't mean...
"You got rid of all the relatives staying in the house?"#I didn't know she could do that...!
<Page61>
"Yes, please do not worry about it.
They are merely people who had lost their home and property, and were hanging on to father's generosity without making any effort. Sooner or later, we were going to ask them to leave the house.
Oh, I have let most of the servants go, but I have left one for myself and you, so there is no problem."
<Page62>
"No, that's way too much! If you do anything like that, you'll be brought up for questioning at the next family reunion!
<Page63>
"Please do not think too hard about it.
Would not you feel more comfortable if we were the only ones in the house than if it was full of people?"
<Page64>
...Ugh.
Well, it really does make me feel better...
<Page65>
"...No, but, you know, is that really what you want?
Even father didn't go against the opinions of his relatives, even though he was so tyrannical and selfish...
<Page66>
"That is right. That is why father entrusted you to the Arima family. But I have hated those people since I was a child. I do not want to listen to any more of their nonsense."
"I'm sorry, Akiha..."
<Page67>
"Oh, for heaven's sake, do not feel sorry for me!
You should be worried about your own life from now on. It is obvious that you're going to have a lot of trouble.
<Page68>
Akiha said unpleasantly, forcing me to end the conversation.
<Page69>
"I'm sure you understand the situation, but you still have not gotten over living in Arima house.
...Well, that is fine, too. I have a servant for that purpose.
If you have any questions in the future, you can ask her.
-Hisui."
<Page70>
Without turning around, Akiha calls out to the girl who was waiting in the corner of the room.
<Page71>
The girl, called Hisui, steps forward and bows to me.
It is an expressionless but polite bow, a crystallization of sincerity.
<Page72>
"This is Hisui, our servant.
She will be your maid from now on, is that alright?"
I see, so she's a servant of the mansion... wait, what?
<Page73>
"Wait, by maid, you mean..."
"A personal servant would be a better description."
<Page74>
...I can't believe it.
Like Akiha, the girl in the maid's uniform doesn't show any expression, as if it's natural for her to do so.
<Page75>
"Wait a minute. Isn't it too much to have a personal servant? I can do my stuff on my own..."
"Even prepare meals and do laundry?"
Akiha's point is relentlessly sharp.
<Page76>
"Anyway, now that you have returned to this mansion, you will follow my instructions.
I do not know how you lived in Arima's house, but from now on you are the eldest son of the Tohno family living in the Tohno house.
Please accept the appropriate treatment as your duty."
<Page77>
"Ugh..."
I sweep my gaze over the girl in the maid's uniform.
Hisui is still expressionless, just staring back at me like a doll.
<Page78>
"Alright then, Hisui, show my brother his room.
It seems that this person is no different from a kitten who doesn't know left from right. Don't let him get lost in this big house."
"Very well, Akiha-sama."
<Page79>
After bowing to Akiha, Hisui comes towards me without any hesitation.
My eyes are on her, but I'm looking over her whole body so that our eyes don't meet.
...Her gait is gentle but not slow, indicating that she has been a servant for a long time.
<Page80>
"'Oh, Shiki. There are certain things that are forbidden in this mansion, certain places that you should not enter, even if you are the eldest son. Please do not violate those laws.
I have also ordered Hisui to take care of you, so please listen to her advice as much as possible."
<Page81>
"Isn't that called being watched over?"
"As long as you maintain a good routine, Hisui will be relieved of this role.
See you at the dinner table."
<Page82>
It seems that Akiha has a full schedule and can't take any more time.
<Page83>
"I will show you to your room, Shiki-sama."
Hisui heads for the door, unconcerned about my confusion.
"...Hah."
Sighing, I too leave the office.

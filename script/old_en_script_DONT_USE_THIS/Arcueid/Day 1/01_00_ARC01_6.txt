The girl leads me to the living room.
The living room, which I haven't seen in seven years, is so different in terms of scale that I feel as if I'm seeing it for the first time.
<Page2>
I wonder if I've gotten too used to the Arima house, or if my standards have risen in these seven years.
Either way, I feel uncomfortable as if this is someone else's house.
I start to look around the living room.
<Page3>
"Fufu.. You're like a scared kitten.
I understand how you feel, but please make yourself comfortable. This is your home, Shiki-sama."
"Y-Yeah, of course."
<Page4>
I rush to sit down on the sofa.
I just came back to my own house and I'm already overwhelmed by everything, it's almost pathetic.

The girl in the kimono moves to the wagon in the corner of the living room, brews tea in a cup, and brings it to the tray.
<Page6>
"Here, have some tea."
"Oh, thank you."
<Page7>
When I'm treated politely with a smiling face, I can't help but be hesitant.
Beyond my life at Arima house, I'm sure I'm just a small town boy at heart.

"I will go talk to Akiha-sama, please wait until then.
It will probably take about 10 minutes, so you may want to look around the house until then."
"You won't mind if I walk around on my own?"
<Page9>
"What are you talking about? This is your house, there is nothing to be afraid of!
......
Oh, no, but you cannot go upstairs, Akiha-sama will be there."
<Page10>
"The first floor is at your disposal.
It has been seven years since you've has been to this house. I'm sure you're feeling nostalgic and excited."
<Page11>
Smiling mischievously,
"Well, then."#The girl, who seemed to be a maid, bows and leaves the room.

Smiling mischievously,
"Well, then."#Kohaku bowed and left the room.

"...Good grief."
The lavishly made living room reverberates my muttering even more loudly.
Should I stay here and pass the time being nervous,
Or should I walk around the house?
I...
C:>will wait here quietly.
C:>will go for a little walk.

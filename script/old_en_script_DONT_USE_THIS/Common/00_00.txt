<Page1>
The next thing I know, I find myself in a hospital bed.
<Page2>
The curtains are swaying, wavering about.
A cool breeze blows through the opened window. 
I can't help but squint my eyes at the riotous colors. 
<Page3>
Where am I?
What day is it?
What's going on?
My mind can't keep up.
<Page4>
As I exert strength into my hands to lift myself up, my body recoils beforehand.
I gasp for air like a fish flapping it's mouth. 
<Page5>
All of this is making my eyes burn up. 
As soon as I place my hands on the firm bed, a searing pain cuts deep into me.
<Page6>
.....
I lay back down, taking a deep breath as I observe my body. 
<Page7>
My hands are covered in bandages.
My left leg is wrapped in a white plaster as well. 
It's awfully tight around my forehead, so it's probably wrapped in bandages too. 
There's a thick adhesive bandage on my chest, covering up anything inconvenient. 
<Page8>
Also, there's a large tube poking out of my left arm. 
Some way or another, I understand it's an IV drip.
<Page9>
It's probably because I was looking around while I was half asleep before I came back to my senses.
<Page10>
In this dreary room reeking of drugs and chemicals, 
I see a series of tubes extending from the bandage on my chest. 
I recall the shapes of scary looking adults visiting me while I was bedridden.
The shape of my little sister who came and was scolded by them. 
And the shape of doctors prancing around like children. 
I remember everything as if it were a dream. 
<Page11>
“Huh? You're not actually awake, are you!?” 
I hear an unfamiliar woman's voice. 
I don't even have the strength to answer her. 
<Page12>
Panicking, the woman darts out of the room calling for a doctor. 
Tap tap tap.
I get that she's in a rush, but she really shouldn't runin the hospital. 
<Page13>
.....
Since I can't raise myself up, I turn my head up to the window. 
Then the center of my eyeballs start feeling like they're about to split in two.
Like the inside of my brain is getting scrambled by a knife. 
<Page14>
Honestly --- A blue sky that looks like a lie.
And rather than the white sunlight, it's the stainless blemish free azure that's so cruel it hurts my eyes. 
<Page15>
A few days later.
Even though I've been awake for a while now, I still can't get out of bed. 
<Page16>
I look up to the sky, towering above as it always has. 
The curtains flutter and sway. 
A dry breeze strokes my cheek. 
The stainless immaculate blue makes my eyes spin. 
<Page17>
Where I am? what day it is?
Why I'm in the hospital?
It's coming back to me, bit by bit. 
<Page18>
All except one thing. 
I continue staring out the window, unable to shake off the feeling that I've forgotten something very important. A “promise” that's bringing me to tears.
<Page19>
"It's nice to meet you, Tohno Shiki-kun. Congratulations on your recovery."
Saying those words, this older man I've never met reaches out for a handshake. 
<Page20>
His truly kind smile and gentle tone give me the impression of a proper adult. 
I'm sure he's someone who can swap between a smile and a straight face with the flick of a switch. 
His tidy-looking white clothes suit him perfectly.
<Page21>
"Can you understand what I am saying, Shiki-kun?"
"--No. Why am I in a hospital?"
"You don't remember, do you? You were involved in a car accident while you were walking."
“Your chest was stabbed by a shard of glass, and it was unlikely that you would survive."
<Page22>
Very unbefitting of what a doctor would say, yet he says it while still smiling cheerfully.
“It was unlikely that you would survive.”
With those words, the nausea I've been keeping a lid on starts bubbling up. 
<Page23>
"--I'm tired. Can I go to sleep?"
“Yes, please do.”
“You must focus on recovering, and not push yourself.”
<Page24>
The doctor is still smiling.
To be honest, I can't stand that smile anymore.
<Page25>
"Doctor, can I ask you something?"
"What is it, Shiki-kun?"
<Page26>
"Why do you have lines all over your body?
There are also so many cracks in this room, it looks like it's about to fall apart."
<Page27>
The smile vanishes for just a brief moment, then returns to his face immediately. He stands up, rising from his chair.
The doctor paces the floor and vanishes behind a curtain. 
<Page28>
"--It seems there was some brain damage after all.
Contact Dr. Ashiya in the neurosurgery department. I also suspect some damage to the optic nerves. Send him in for an eye examination this afternoon."
The doctor whispers this to the nurse in a cold voice, almost like he's a different person. 
<Page29>
"....It's weird. There are lines all over everyone's bodies."
<Page30>
The messy lines are all over the hospital.
I don't know what they mean, but I feel sick just looking at them.
<Page31>
 “...What are these things?” 
The lines are on the bed too. 
Maybe I can touch them..#Poke. #My finger sinks in.
<Page32>
"...Ah."
If I had something slimmer, I could go even deeper.
So I grab a plastic knife off the shelf and trace the scribbles. 
Even though I barely tried, the knife still sinks all the way to the bottom of the scribbles. 
<Page33>
This is fun, so I'll slide the knife on the scribbles on the bed just like before. 
Thud.
With a heavy sound, the bed is ripped cleanly apart. 
<Page34>
"Kyaaaahhh!"
<Page35>
I turn around, facing the voice behind me. 
There's a nurse in front of the door with a disturbed look on her face. 
<Page36>
"How did you break the bed, Shiki-kun?"
He keeps on asking me “how” I broke the bed, not so much the reason I did it. 
<Page37>
“I traced the line and it broke.” 
“Hey, why does the hospital have cracks everywhere?” 
<Page38>
“Okay that's enough, Shiki-kun. There are no such lines. So tell me, how did you break the bed? I won't get angry.”
<Page39>
“—I already told you. All I did was trace the lines.”
“...I see. We'll talk about it tomorrow then.”
<Page40>
The doctor sighs.
Ever since I mentioned the lines, that kind smile of his is nowhere to be seen.
I'm sure that “switch” of his must have flipped.
Seems this hospital is full of so many fragile things. 
<Page41>
In the end, no one believed my story.
<Page42>
No matter what it is, if I cut its lines with a knife, it gets sliced clean.
I don't need to put any force into it. 
I could cut it as easily as I could cut paper with scissors.
<Page43>
Whether it's the bed, a chair, the walls, or the floor. 
...And even though I'd never attempt it, maybe, no, definitely humans too. 
<Page44>
It looks like no one else can see these lines. 
Lines that only I can see. 
<Page45>
They're just like patchwork.#Right after stitching up a wound. 
Sort of like the mark on my chest that's still healing after surgery. And just like that, can be torn apart with a touch.
Because otherwise, there's no way a kid could slice through a wall with strength alone.
<Page46>
"........#......!"
She's yelling at me.
She's glaring at me, staring at the unevenly cut hole in the wall. 
<Page47>
The shrieking gets louder and louder. 
My hearing's getting hazy, so I don't find it too obnoxious.
The never ending noise reminds me of a cicada lit on fire; it's making me uncomfortable. 
<Page48>
Everything is falling apart. 
Just opening my eyes, just being alive, is sickening enough to make me want to disappear.
<Page49>
...... Ah. I didn't realize it until now. 
This world is full of stitches. 
I had no idea it could be so easily torn apart. 
<Page50>
No one can see it. 
I guess that's how they can be so calm. 
They don't even notice how messed up this world is at all. 
They don't know their everyday life is full of scars. 
But I can see it.
And I'm so scared, I can't even walk. 
<Page51>
Speaking of, my ears have been frozen since then, and it's gotten quieter despite the noise. 
Only the wound in my chest sounds like a siren.
But when was that?
I try to recall, but it's no use. I scratch my head, but even that doesn't help. I'm sure I must've made myself forget it because it wasn't important. Like a faucet that kept spilling water no matter how hard you close it. 
<Page52>
...... Ah, I see.
That explains everything.
It makes sense there isn't a mirror here.
If that were the case, I would have ■ before anything else. 
I'm sure I'd crack up while laughing. 
In other words, it's not the world around me that's breaking down. 
I'm the only thing that's broken. 
<Page53>
That's probably why.
It's been two weeks and no one believes me.
It's been two weeks and no one's come to see me.
It's been two weeks.
I am alone, living in a world full of gaps. ----
<Page54>
I don't want to be in a hospital room.
I don't want to be in a place full of lines.
I want to get away from here.
I decided to go to an empty, faraway place.
<Page55>
I'm not the one who's crazy, 
I jumped out of the window as if to tell myself that there was something wrong with this place.
<Page56>
But the wound in my chest was so painful that I could only run a little.
When I came to my senses.
I found myself in a field next to a hospital.
I hadn't gotten very far.
<Page57>
"...... Gohh."
My chest hurt and I felt so sad that I crouched down on the ground and coughed.
<Page58>
I can't go anywhere, and I shouldn't.
A person who can see the lines should not be anywhere.
<Page59>
Gohh, gohh, gohh.
There is no one.
It was the end of summer, in a sea of grass.
I felt like I was going to disappear.
<Page60>
But before that.
"You. You shouldn't be crouching down like that."
There was a woman's voice, clearly audible.
<Page61>
"What.........?"
"It's not that.
You're too small to be seen while crouching in the grass. Be careful, you almost got kicked off."
<Page62>
The woman pointed at me wryly.
...... I'm a little pissed off.
I'm fourth from the front in my class, so I guess I'm not so short.
<Page63>
"Who's going to kick me off?"
"Of course me, silly.
You and I are the only ones here, so who else could it be?"
The woman crossed her arms and said confidently.
<Page64>
"Well, since we're here for a reason, why don't you give me some company? I'm Aoko Aozaki, what's your name?"
<Page65>
The woman reached out to me as casually as a friend.
I couldn't find any reason to refuse, so I told her my name was Tohno Shiki and grabbed her hand back as if I were being sucked into it.
<Page66>
I enjoyed chatting with the woman very much.
She didn't ignore me because I was a child.
She listened to me as a human being.
<Page67>
We talked about many things.
About my home. I told her about my family, an old family with a long history, and that my father was a strict man who was particular about etiquettes.
<Page68>
That I had a younger sister named Akiha, who was very quiet and always followed me around.
<Page69>
How I always played with Akiha and her friends in the forest-like garden of our large house.
<Page70>
How the attic was a secret place. How I was not good at <Shiri|words><tori|chain> anymore. That I was still expected to grow taller.
<Page71>
About how I used to like the smell of the hospital but now I couldn't stand it anymore.
How the cloudless blue sky is so beautiful, but when I look at it, I feel like crying.
How it's wonderful to be alive, and I don't dislike that doctor with the fake smile.
<Page72>
...Really.
As if in a frenzy, I talked about many things.
<Page73>
"Oops, it's getting late.
Sorry, Shiki. I have some business to attend to, so let's end this conversation here."
<Page74>
The woman is leaving.
...... I was sad, thinking that I would be alone again.
<Page75>
"I'll be waiting for you here tomorrow, okay?
You should go back to your room and do exactly as the doctor says."
<Page76>
"Ah..."
The woman walked away as if it was a matter of course.
<Page77>
"...See you tomorrow."
Tomorrow we can talk again, like today.
I'm glad. For the first time since I woke up from the accident, I felt human again.
<Page78>
It became my routine to go to the field in the afternoon.
The woman would get upset if I called her Aoko. She said she didn't like her name.
After much pondering, I decided to call her "Sensei" because she seemed to be an important person.
<Page79>
Sensei listens to me seriously no matter what I say and solves my problems in a few words.
<Page80>
After the accident, I had become uncomfortable talking to people, but thanks to her, I was able to gradually return to my normal self.
<Page81>
Only when I was in this field, my anxiety disappeared because I knew that I was my original self.
So, I don't know who she is, but she might really be a teacher in some school.
<Page82>
But that's just a what if that has nothing to do with me.
I enjoy being with my Sensei.
It's that simple, that's all that matters.
<Page83>
"Hey, Sensei. I can do something like this."
I wanted to surprise her a little, so I used the knife I brought from the hospital to cut a tree in the field.
<Page84>
I traced the line and cut out half of the tree from the middle, like ripping a piece of paper.
<Page85>
"It's amazing, isn't it? I can easily cut anything where I can see the lines. No one else can do that."
<Page86>
.....
Sensei was surprised.
I got really good at it, so I put my knife into the base of the tree, in a straight horizontal line.
<Page87>
"Shiki...!"
Sensei ran up to me and slapped me on the cheek.
<Page88>
"Sen....sei?"
"Stop it. You've just done something very careless."
<Page89>
Sensei looked at me with serious eyes.
Relentless and unwavering eyes that punishes the wrongdoers.
<Page90>
Ah, what a fool I was.
I've been enjoying this time too much.
I forgot about myself.
<Page91>
These lines should never have been here.
And I who can see it, shouldn't be alive either.
<Page92>
........
A bloody regret stains my heart.
I feel like dying at my own stupidity.
That tree, the only one left, was a record of the time when this field was a forest.
I wanted Sensei to praise me, so I destroyed it for no reason.
<Page93>
"...I'm.....sorry."
The next thing I knew, I was in tears.
Even though I knew that crying was cowardly and unmanly, I couldn't stop myself from regretting it.
<Page94>
"—Shiki."
A soft sensation.
And, of course, Sensei had to hug someone like me, who was still holding a knife.
<Page95>
"You don't need to apologize.
Oh, well, you did something you should be upset about,but that doesn't mean you're the only one to blame.
"...... I'm not the only one to blame.......?"
<Page96>
"Yes. But you know what, Shiki? Apart from that,if someone doesn't scold you now, it'll be irreversible.
That's why I saw you as a human being.
I gave you my opinion as a person in the same position, got angry and slapped you. If I hadn't used the right amount of force, I might have even killed you."
<Page97>
Those words were really scary.
It was not a "what if" that I might have been killed, but that I felt too sad to let this person do such a thing to me.
<Page98>
"Don't cry, Shiki. I won't apologize either.
I just want you to remember that you did something wrong.
...... Well. In return, you can hate me if you want."
<Page99>
"......No. I don't hate you."
"I see, I'm really glad.
...... I think this is why I met you."
<Page100>
And then.
Sensei quietly asked me about the lines I was seeing, as if to dissolve my regret.
When I told her about it, she tightened her arms around me even more.
<Page101>
"......Shiki, what you see is real.
Even though it should never be seen.
Even though it's impossible for other humans.
Those lines are not an illusion, it's a reality that exists only for you.
<Page102>
"...... I see.
So I'm the only one who's odd."
"Yes, you're odd and there's nothing you can do about it."
<Page103>
I fought back the tears that were coming to my eyes.
The same words hurt many times more than when the doctor said them, and I felt like I was going to break.
<Page104>
But I knew it was coming.
From the beginning, I've always known that I'm a child who shouldn't be here, from the moment I woke up.
<Page105>
"Don't be hasty. That anomaly is just weird, not unexplainable.
Humans can face anything as long as it makes sense —that's my rule of thumb.
No matter how ridiculous the bullshit that comes our way, we humans have the wits and courage to get through it."
<Page106>
Lesson number one, said Sensei, looking a little embarrassed.
Even if there is something abnormal, it is not a problem in itself.
The problem is how we deal with it.
<Page107>
"Then, can you also explain these lines ?"
"Of course. Things have a tendency to break easily in certain places."
<Page108>
"We are not perfect because we break as well.
Your eyes see the end of things like that..... In other words, you're seeing the future."
"I'm... seeing ...... the future?"
<Page109>
"Yes. You don't need to know more than that right now.
If the time comes when you go along with the flow, you will inevitably understand the logic behind it."
<Page110>
"Sensei ....... I don't know what you're talking about."
"It's all right. There's only one thing you need to understand for now. The lines should never be cut unnecessarily.
—Your eyes make life too easy for things."
<Page111>
"Ok. I won't do it if Sensei says so.
Besides, my chest hurts a little... I'm sorry, Sensei. I won't do it again."
<Page112>
"...... Good.
Shiki, don't ever forget how you feel now. If you don't, you'll be happy for sure."
<Page113>
The arms that were holding me were untied.
The cold but warm feeling left me.
<Page114>
"But Sensei. I feel uneasy when I see these lines. If I touch a line, it will break, right? Then everything around me could fall apart at any moment."
<Page115>
"I'll take care of that problem,
It seems that's why I'm here."
<Page116>
Sensei sighed audibly and then smiled like the sun.
<Page117>
"Shiki. Tomorrow, I will have a special gift for you.
I will give you back your old life."
<Page118>
Next day.
On the seventh day after we met, Sensei came to the field with a large trunk in her hand.
<Page119>
"Yes, If you wear this, you won't be able to see any more of those strange lines."
<Page120>
What she offered me was a pair of plain glasses.
<Page121>
"I don't have bad eyesight."
"Just put them on. They don't have any corrective lenses."
<Page122>
Sensei forced me to put on the glasses.
And then...
<Page123>
"Whoa!! Wow, that's amazing, Sensei!
I can't see the lines!"
"Of course. I went to the trouble of stealing my sister's Mystic Eye Killers to make this, it's Aoko Aozaki's best work yet. I won't let you get away with it if you treat it badly, Shiki."
<Page124>
"Yeah, I'll take care of it! You're great, Sensei!
All those lines that I didn't like so much are gone, it's like magic!"
"Of course it's magic, because I am a Magician."
<Page125>
Smiling proudly, Sensei placed the trunk on the ground.
<Page126>
"But you know what, Shiki? It's not that the lines have disappeared. They're just invisible. If you take off your glasses, you will see them again."
"Invisible, huh?"
<Page127>
"Yes, and there is nothing you can do about it. You'll just have to live with it."
<Page128>
"......... No. I don't want these horrible eyes.
If I cut any line again, I won't be able to keep my promise to my Sensei."
<Page129>
"Oh, that thing about never cutting the line again.
You can break a promise as easily as you like."
"...... Really? Because you said it was a very wrong thing to do."
<Page130>
"Yes, it's wrong.
But you can't rely on anyone's words, it's your own power.
So it is up to you when to use those eyes. No one else can blame you for having them.
The only thing that can be questioned is what you do with that power, Shiki."
<Page131>
"What I... do..."
<Page132>
Sensei looked straight into my eyes, as if staring into my soul.
<Page133>
"That's what I'm talking about. ...... Yes, those are good eyes.
I'll be honest with you. When I first met you, I thought I'd bumped into a pain in the ass, because by the looks of you, you've lost a lot of things.
But there was never a problem. You're alive. Then spend your life trying to get it back."
<Page134>
.....
—I will never be able to put into words the joy and the warmth that filled my chest at that moment.
"You can stay here."
She affirmed that, stronger than anyone else.
<Page135>
"Shiki. You have a very unique set of abilities. But the fact that you have it means something.
God doesn't share his power for no reason. There are times in your future when you'll need it, and that's why you have those eyes. That would be cruel, but.."
<Page136>
"So don't forget. You have a very straightforward heart.
As long as you're who you are, your eyes will never make a mistake."
<Page137>
"I'm not asking you to be a saint, You can be the adult you think is right.
If you can accept the wrong and say you're sorry, you'll become a wonderful boy in ten years."
<Page138>
Sensei stood up and reached for the trunk.
<Page139>
"Oh, but don't take off your glasses unless you have to. Special powers call other special powers.
Yes, this is my advice to you.
Think carefully about where to play the foul and where to win.
I hope it doesn't come to that, but only take off your glasses when you decide it's out of your control, and use your power with responsibility."
<Page140>
"The power itself is not a bad thing.
It is up to you to decide whether the result will be good or bad."
<Page141>
The trunk is lifted.
—Sensei didn't say anything more.
I knew that this was goodbye.
<Page142>
"I can't do this, Sensei. I can't make things better by myself.
I was really scared before I met you. But because of you, I was able to be myself again.
...It's no good. If I don't have Sensei, I don't want to have these glasses...!"
<Page143>
"Shiki, don't say anything you don't mean. Lies that can't even fool you will make your listeners uncomfortable."
<Page144>
Sensei raised her eyebrows in a frown and flicked her finger at my forehead.
<Page145>
"You know what you're doing, don't you? You know you will be fine.
Then, don't throw away the person you've become by saying such trivial things."
<Page146>
"I'm going to say goodbye now. Bye, Shiki.
Life is full of pitfalls for any human being.
You're capable of handling them, so you should be more cheerful."
<Page147>
Sensei is leaving.
I was very sad, but since I was her friend, I decided to send her off.
<Page148>
"....Yeah, goodbye, Sensei."
<Page149>
"Good job, that's the spirit.
One last lesson. When you're in a pinch, calm down first, and then think it over.
Don't worry. You'll do just fine on your own."
Sensei smiled happily.
<Page150>
A gust of wind blew.
The grasses are all waving in unison.
Sensei was no longer there.
<Page151>
"...Bye bye, Sensei"
I said, realizing that I would never see her again.
<Page152>
All that remains are a bunch of words and these strange glasses.
It was only for seven days, but it taught me the most important things.
<Page153>
As I sat there in a daze, tears welled up in my eyes.
—Oh, what a fool I am.
All I did was say goodbye.
I never said thank you.
<Page154>
I was discharged from the hospital soon after that.
After discharge I was not sent to Tohno mansion, but to another house.
<Page155>
Although my body had recovered, I was still suffering from the aftereffects of the accident, and I became an unwanted child for Tohno family.
But that's okay.
Tohno Shiki can do fine on his own.
<Page156>
He will lead a new life with a new family.
I leave the hospital room where I spent the summer of my tenth year.
<Page157>
The curtains are still wavering.
I squint my eyes once again at the azure sky.
A light breeze announces the end of summer.

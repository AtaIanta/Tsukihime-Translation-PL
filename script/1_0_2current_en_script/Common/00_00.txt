<Page1>
The next thing I know, I find myself in a hospital bed.
<Page2>
The curtains are swaying, wavering about.
A cool breeze blows through the opened window.
I can't help but squint my eyes at the riotous colors.
<Page3>
Where am I?
What day is it?
What's going on?
My mind can't keep up.
<Page4>
When I put strength into my hands to try and get up, I feel a sharp pain in my body before my hands.
I gasp for air like a fish flapping its mouth.
<Page5>
This feeling, it was as though a fire was coming out of my eyes.
As soon as I place my hands on the firm bed, a searing pain cuts deep into me.
<Page6>
"--- ---"
I take a deep breath and inspect my body while I'm lying down.
<Page7>
My hands are covered in bandages.
My left leg is also wrapped in a white plaster.
It's awfully tight around my forehead, so it's probably wrapped in bandages too.
There's a large, thick adhesive bandage on my chest, covering up anything inconvenient.
<Page8>
There is a single tube inserted in my left arm.
I could vaguely understand that this is an IV drip.
<Page9>
I guess it was because I was looking around half-asleep before waking up.
<Page10>
The darker room that smelled of medicine,
the numerous tubes extending from the bandage on my chest,
the scary man in the suit that came to visit,
the sight of my sister being scolded by that man,
and even the sight of the doctor frolicking like a child,
all of which, I remember as though it were a dream.
<Page11>
"Huh? You're not actually awake, are you!?"
I hear an unfamiliar girl's voice.
I don't even have the strength to answer her.
<Page12>
Panicking, the woman darts out of the room calling for a doctor.
Pitter patter pitter patter.
I get that she's in a rush, but she really shouldn't run in a hospital.
<Page13>
"------"
I couldn't raise my body, so I turned my head to look up at the window.
My eyeballs throb as though they are about to splinter in two.
My brain feels like it's been scrambled with a knife.
<Page14>
Truly... an unbelievable blue sky.
More than the white rays of sunlight, it was the harshness of that unblemished blue that pained my eyes.
<Page15>
A few days later.
For a while after I woke up, I couldn't move from the bed.
<Page16>
Looking up, I can see the lofty skies outside same as ever.
The curtains flutter and sway.
A dry breeze strokes my cheek.
The stainless, immaculate blue makes my eyes spin.
<Page17>
Where am I? What day is it?
Why am I in the hospital?
It's coming back to me, bit by bit.
<Page18>
All except one thing.
I continue staring out the window, unable to shake off the feeling that I've forgotten something very important. A "promise" that's bringing me to tears.
<Page19>
"It's nice to meet you, Tohno Shiki-kun. Congratulations on your recovery."
Saying those words, an old man whom I've never seen before reaches out for a handshake.
<Page20>
His kind smile and gentle tone give me the impression of a fine adult.
I'm sure he's someone who can swap between a smile and a straight face with the flick of a switch.
His immaculate white clothes, not a thing out of place, suited him perfectly.
<Page21>
"Can you understand what I am saying, Shiki-kun?"
"...No. Why am I in a hospital?"
"You don't remember, do you? You were involved in a car accident while you were walking down the street."
"Your chest was pierced by a shard of glass. It was unlikely that you would survive."
<Page22>
The old man in white says something very unbefitting of what a doctor would say, still with a smile on his face.
"It was unlikely that you would survive."
With those words, the nausea I've been holding back starts bubbling up.
<Page23>
"...I'm tired. Can I go to sleep?"
"Yes, please do."
"You must focus on recovering, do not push yourself."
<Page24>
The doctor is still smiling.
To be honest, I can't stand that smile anymore.
<Page25>
"Doctor, can I ask you something?"
"What is it, Shiki-kun?"
<Page26>
"Why do you have lines all over your body?
And there are so many cracks in this room as well, it looks like it's about to fall apart."
<Page27>
Although his smile vanished for a brief moment, he quickly returned to his smiling face and stood up from his chair.
The doctor clatters across the floor and vanishes behind a curtain.
<Page28>
"...It seems there was some brain damage after all.
Contact Doctor Ashiya in the neurosurgery department. I also suspect some damage to the optic nerves. Send him in for an eye examination this afternoon."
The doctor whispers to the nurse in a cold voice, as if he's an entirely different person.
<Page29>
"....It's weird. There are lines all over everyone's bodies."
<Page30>
The messy lines are all over the hospital.
I don't know what they mean, but I feel sick just looking at them.
<Page31>
"...What are these things?"
The lines are on the bed too.
When I touch it with my finger, #Poke. #My finger sinks in.
<Page32>
"---Ah."
If I had something thinner, I could go even deeper.
So I grab a plastic knife off the shelf and trace the lines.
Even though I barely tried, the knife sinks all the way to the bottom of the lines.
<Page33>
This is fun, so I'll slide the knife along the lines of the bed.
Thud.
With a heavy sound, the bed is cleanly sliced apart.
<Page34>
"Kyaaaahhh!"
<Page35>
I turn around, facing the voice behind me.
There's a nurse in front of the door with a disturbed look on her face.
<Page36>
"How did you break the bed, Shiki-kun?"
He keeps on asking me "how" I broke the bed, not so much as why I did it.
<Page37>
"I traced the line and it broke.
Hey, why does the hospital have cracks everywhere?"
<Page38>
"Okay that's enough, Shiki-kun. There are no such lines. So tell me, how did you break the bed? I won't get angry, so tell me."
<Page39>
"---I already told you. All I did was trace the lines."
"...I see. We'll talk about it tomorrow then."
<Page40>
The doctor sighs.
Ever since I mentioned the lines, that kind smile of his is nowhere to be seen.
I'm sure that "switch" of his must be broken.
Seems like this hospital is full of so many fragile things.
<Page41>
In the end, no one believed my story.
<Page42>
No matter what it is, if I cut its lines with a knife, it gets sliced clean.
I don't need to put any force into it.
I could cut it as easily as I could cut paper with scissors.
<Page43>
Whether it's the bed, a chair, the walls, or the floor.
...And even though I'd never attempted it, maybe, no, definitely humans too.
<Page44>
It looks like no one else can see these lines.
Lines that only I can see.
<Page45>
They're just like patchwork.
Right after stitching up a wound.
Sort of like the mark on my chest that's still healing after surgery. And just like that, can be torn apart with a touch.
Because otherwise, there's no way a kid could slice through a wall with strength alone.
<Page46>
"--- #---!"
The nurse is yelling at me again.
After staring at the unevenly cut hole in the wall, she glared at me.
<Page47>
The shrieking gets louder and louder.
My hearing has gotten hazy, so I don't find it too obnoxious.
The never ending noise reminds me of a cicada lit on fire; it's making me uncomfortable.
<Page48>
Everything is falling apart.
Just opening my eyes, just being alive, is sickening enough to make me want to disappear.
<Page49>
......Ah. I didn't realize it until now.
This world is full of stitches.
I had no idea it could be torn apart that easily.
<Page50>
No one can see it.
I guess that's how they can remain so calm.
They don't even notice how messed up this world is, at all.
They don't know their everyday life is full of holes.
But I can see it.
And it scares me so much, I can't even walk.
<Page51>
Speaking of which, my ears have been frozen since then, and it's gotten quieter despite the noise.
Only the wound in my chest reverberates like a siren.
But "when" was "that"?
I try to recall, but it's no use. I scratch my head, but even that doesn't help. I'm sure I must've forgotten about it because it wasn't very important. Like a faucet that kept spilling water no matter how hard you close it.
<Page52>
......Ah, I see.
That explains everything.
It makes sense there isn't a mirror here.
If that were the case, I would have â–  before anything else.
I'm sure I'd crack up laughing.
In other words, it's not the world around me that's breaking down.
I'm the only one that's broken.
<Page53>
That's probably why.
It's been two weeks since then and no one believes me.
It's been two weeks since then and no one's come to see me.
It's been two weeks.
I am alone, living in a world full of cracks----
<Page54>
I don't want to be in a hospital room.
I don't want to be in a place full of lines.
I get away from here,
and decided to go to a faraway place with no one around.
<Page55>
I'm not the one who's crazy.
I jumped out of the window as if to convince myself that there was something wrong with that place.
<Page56>
But the wound in my chest was so painful that I could only run a little.
When I came to my senses.
I found myself in a field next to the hospital.
I hadn't gotten very far.
<Page57>
"......Gohh."
My chest hurts and I feel so sad that I crouched down on the ground, coughing.
<Page58>
I can't go anywhere and I shouldn't.
A person who can see these lines shouldn't be anywhere.
<Page59>
Gohh, gohh, gohh.
There is no one.
It was the end of summer in a sea of grass.
At this rate, I felt like I was going to disappear.
<Page60>
But before that.
"You. You shouldn't be crouching down like that."
It was a woman's voice that reached my ears clearly.
<Page61>
"Eh.........?"
"Don't you "Eh" me.
You're too small to be seen while crouching in the grass like that. I was almost about to send you flying."
<Page62>
The woman wryly pointed at me.
......I'm a little pissed.
I'm the fourth tallest in my class, so I don't think I'm that short.
<Page63>
"Who's going to get sent flying?"
"Don't be ridiculous, that should be obvious.
We're the only ones here, so if you count me out then who's left?"
The woman crossed her arms and said confidently.
<Page64>
"Well, it must be fate for us to meet like this, so why don't you keep me company for a bit? My name is Aozaki Aoko, and you are?"
<Page65>
The woman reached out to me as casually as if she was a friend.
I couldn't find any reason to refuse, so I told her my name was Tohno Shiki and grabbed her hand back as if I were being sucked into it.
<Page66>
I enjoyed chatting with her quite a lot.
She didn't ignore me just because I was a child.
She listened to me properly as a human being.
<Page67>
We talked about many things.
About my home. I told her about my family, an old family with a long history, and that my father was a strict man who was particular about etiquettes.
<Page68>
That I had a younger sister named Akiha, who was very quiet and always followed me around.
<Page69>
How I always played with Akiha and her friends in the forest-like garden of our large mansion.
<Page70>
How the attic was a secret place. How I was not good at <Shiri|words><tori|chain> anymore. And that I was still expected to grow taller.
<Page71>
About how I used to like the smell of the hospital but now I couldn't stand it anymore.
How the cloudless blue sky is so beautiful, but when I look at it, I feel like crying.
How it's wonderful to be alive, and I don't dislike the doctor with the fake smile.
<Page72>
---Really.
As if in a frenzy, I talked about many things.
<Page73>
"Oops, it's already getting late.
Sorry about that, Shiki. I have some business to attend to, so let's end this conversation here."
<Page74>
The woman was leaving.
......I was sad, thinking that I would be alone again.
<Page75>
"Then, I'll be waiting for you here tomorrow, okay?
You should go back to your room and do exactly as the doctor says."
<Page76>
"Ah---"
The woman walked away as if it was a matter of course.
<Page77>
"...See you tomorrow."
Tomorrow we can talk again, just like today.
I'm glad. For the first time since I woke up from the accident, I felt human again.
<Page78>
It became my routine to go to the field in the afternoon.
The woman would get upset if I called her Aoko. She said she didn't like her name.
After much pondering, I decided to call her "Sensei" because she seemed to be an important person.
<Page79>
Sensei listens to me seriously no matter what I say and solves my problems with just a few words.
<Page80>
After the accident, I had become uncomfortable talking to people, but thanks to her, I was able to gradually return to my normal self.
<Page81>
Only when I was in this field did my anxiety disappear because I knew that I can be my normal self here.
Even though I don't know who she is, she might really be a teacher in some school.
<Page82>
But that's just a "what if" that has nothing to do with me.
I enjoy being with Sensei.
It's that simple, that's all that matters.
<Page83>
"Hey, Sensei. Look what I can do."
I wanted to surprise her a little, so I used the knife I brought from the hospital to cut the tree in the field.
<Page84>
I traced the line and cut out half of the tree from the middle, like cutting a piece of paper.
<Page85>
"It's amazing, isn't it? I can easily cut anything where I see the lines. No one else can do that."
<Page86>
"------"
Sensei was surprised.
I got really good at it, so I thrust my knife into the base of the tree, in a horizontal line.
<Page87>
"Shiki---!"
Sensei ran up to me and slapped me on the cheek.
<Page88>
"Sen....sei?"
"Stop it. You've just done something incredibly reckless."
<Page89>
Sensei looked at me with serious eyes.
Relentless and unwavering eyes that punish wrongdoers.
<Page90>
Ah, what a fool I was.
I've been enjoying this time too much.
I forgot about myself.
<Page91>
These lines should never have been here.
And I who can see them, shouldn't be alive either.
<Page92>
"------ah"
A bloody regret stains my heart.
I feel like dying from my own stupidity.
That tree, the only one left, was a record of the time when this field was a forest.
In wanting to be praised by Sensei, I had destroyed it for no reason.
<Page93>
"......I'm sorry."
The next thing I knew, I was in tears.
Even though I knew that crying was cowardly and unmanly, I couldn't stop myself from regretting it.
<Page94>
"---Shiki."
A soft sensation.
While I was still holding the knife, Sensei embraced a person like me as it was natural.
<Page95>
"You don't need to apologize.
Yeah, well, you did do something that is unacceptable, but that doesn't mean you're the only one to blame."
"......? I'm not the only one to blame.......?"
<Page96>
"Yes. But you know what, Shiki? Apart from that, if someone doesn't scold you now, it'll be irreversible.
That's why I saw you as a human being.
I treated you as a fellow human and gave you my opinion, get angry and slapped you. If I hadn't used the right amount of force, I might have even killed you."
<Page97>
Those words were really scary.
It was not a "what if" that I might have been killed, but that I felt too sad to let this person do such a thing to me.
<Page98>
"Don't cry, Shiki. I won't apologize either.
I just want you to remember that you did something wrong.
......Yeah. In return, it's okay for you to hate me."
<Page99>
"......No. I don't hate you."
"---I see, I'm very glad.
......I think you and I met for this reason."
<Page100>
And then.
Sensei gently asked me about the lines I was seeing, as if to melt away my regret.
When I told her about it, she tightened her arms around me even more.
<Page101>
"......Shiki, what you see is real.
Even though it should never be seen.
Even though it's impossible for other humans.
Those lines are not an illusion, it's a reality that exists only for you."
<Page102>
"......I see.
So I'm the only one who's strange."
"Yes, you're strange. There is no doubt about it."
<Page103>
I fought back the tears that were coming to my eyes.
The same words hurt many times more than when the doctor said them, and I felt like I was going to break.
<Page104>
But I knew it was coming.
From the beginning, ---I've always known that I'm a child who shouldn't exist from the moment I woke up.
<Page105>
"Don't be hasty. That anomaly is just weird, not unexplainable.
Humans can face anything as long as it makes sense--- that's based on my experience.
No matter how ridiculous life gets, we humans have the wits and courage to get through it."
<Page106>
Lesson number one, said Sensei, looking a little embarrassed.
Even if there is something abnormal, it is not a problem by itself.
The problem is how we deal with it.
<Page107>
"Then, can you also explain these lines...?"
"Of course. Things have a tendency to break easily in certain places."
<Page108>
"We are not perfect because we break as well.
Your eyes see the end of things like that..... In other words, you're seeing the future."
"...I'm ...seeing the future?"
<Page109>
"Yes. You don't need to know more than that right now.
I'm sure that in due time, if it becomes necessary, you will come to understand the reason behind it."
<Page110>
"......Sensei, I'm not sure I completely understand."
"That's right, you shouldn't be. There's only one thing you need to understand for now. It is that you should never be playing around and cutting these lines.
With your eyes, it becomes dangerously easy to take a life."
<Page111>
"Ok. I won't do it if you say so.
Besides, my chest is starting to hurt... I'm sorry, Sensei. I won't do it again."
<Page112>
"......Good.
Shiki, don't ever forget how you feel right now. If you don't, you'll be happy for sure."
<Page113>
The arms that were embracing me were loosened.
The cold but warm feeling left me.
<Page114>
"But Sensei. I feel uneasy when I see these lines. If I touch a line, it will break, right? Then it wouldn't be strange if I cut something around me by accident."
<Page115>
"I'll take care of that problem.
That seems to be the reason why I'm here."
<Page116>
Sensei sighed audibly and then smiled like the sun.
<Page117>
"Shiki. Tomorrow, I will have a special gift for you.
I will give you your old life back."
<Page118>
The next day.
On the seventh day after we met, Sensei came to the field with a large suitcase in hand.
<Page119>
"Here, if you wear this, you won't be able to see any more of those strange lines."
<Page120>
What she offered me was a pair of plain glasses.
<Page121>
"I don't have bad eyesight."
"Just put them on. They don't have any corrective lenses."
<Page122>
Sensei forced me to put on the glasses.
And then---
<Page123>
"Whoa!! Wow, that's amazing, Sensei!
I can't see the lines!"
"Of course. I went to the trouble of stealing my sister's Mystic Eye Killers to make this, it's Aozaki Aoko's best work yet. I won't let you get away with it if you treat them badly, Shiki."
<Page124>
"Yeah, I'll take care of them! You're amazing, Sensei!
All those lines that I hated so much are gone, it's like magic!"
"Of course it's magic, because I am a magician."
<Page125>
Smiling proudly, Sensei placed her suitcase on the ground.
<Page126>
"But you know what, Shiki? It's not that the lines have disappeared. You just can't see them. If you take off your glasses, you will see them again."
"I can't see them, huh?"
<Page127>
"Yes, and there is nothing you can do about it. You'll just have to live with it."
<Page128>
".........No. I don't want these horrible eyes.
If I cut any line again, I won't be able to keep my promise to you."
<Page129>
"Ah, that thing about never cutting the line again.
Silly, you can break that promise easily."
"......Really? Because you said it was a very wrong thing to do."
<Page130>
"Yes, it's wrong.
But no one can rely on your eyes. That power belongs to you alone.
So it is up to you when to use those eyes. No one else can blame you for having them.
The only thing that can be questioned is what you do with that power, Shiki."
<Page131>
"What--- I do---"
<Page132>
Sensei looked straight into my eyes, as if staring into my soul.
<Page133>
"That's what I'm talking about. ......Yep, those are good eyes.
I'll be honest with you. When I first met you, I thought I'd bumped into a pain in the ass, because by the looks of it, you've lost a lot of things.
But there was never a problem. You're alive. So spend your life trying to get it back."
<Page134>
"------"
---I will never be able to put into words the joy and warmth that filled my chest at this moment.
"It's all right for you to be here" she said.
She affirmed that, stronger than anyone else.
<Page135>
"Shiki. Even among the abilities that other people possess, the one you have is awfully unique. But the fact that you have it must have some sort of meaning.
God doesn't share his power for no reason. There are times in your future when you'll need it, and that's why you have the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception. Even though I know how cruel this is---"
<Page136>
"So don't forget. You have an unwavering heart.
As long as you remain the way you are now, your eyes will never bring forth any wrong.
<Page137>
"I'm not asking you to be a saint. You can be the person you think is right.
If you can accept your mistakes and are able to apologize, you'll grow up to be a wonderful boy in ten years."
<Page138>
Sensei stood up and reached for her suitcase.
<Page139>
"Ah, but I must say, don't take off your glasses unless you have to. Special powers attract special powers after all.
Alright, this is the second lesson, an advice from me.
Think carefully about where to play the foul and where to win.
I hope it doesn't come to that, but only take off your glasses when you decide the situation out of your control and use your power responsibly."
<Page140>
"The power itself is not a bad thing.
It is up to you to decide whether the result will be good or bad."
<Page141>
She picks up her suitcase.
---Sensei didn't say anything more.
I knew that this was farewell.
<Page142>
"---I can't do this, Sensei. I can't make things better by myself.
I was really scared before I met you. But because of you, I was able to be myself again.
...It's no good. If I don't have you, I don't want to have these glasses...!"
<Page143>
"Shiki, don't say something you don't mean. Telling lies that even you yourself can't believe, you'll only make whoever hears you sad."
<Page144>
Sensei raised her eyebrows in a frown and flicked her finger at my forehead.
<Page145>
"You know what you're doing, right? You know you will be fine.
Then, don't throw away the person you've become by saying such trivial things."
<Page146>
"Well, this is goodbye. Bye, Shiki.
Life is full of pitfalls for any human being.
You're capable of handling them, so you should be more cheerful."
<Page147>
Sensei is leaving.
I am very sad, but since I am her friend, I decide to send her off.
<Page148>
"....Yeah, goodbye, Sensei."
<Page149>
"Good job, that's the spirit.
One last lesson. When you're in a pinch, calm down first, and then think it over.
And don't worry. You'll do just fine on your own."
Sensei smiled happily.
<Page150>
A gust of wind blew.
The grasses are all waving in unison.
Sensei was no longer there.
<Page151>
"...Bye bye, Sensei."
I said, realizing that I would never see her again.
<Page152>
All that remains are the words she left behind and these strange glasses.
It was only for seven days but she taught me the most important of things.
<Page153>
As I sat there in a daze, tears welled up in my eyes.
---Ah, what a fool I am.
All I did was say goodbye.
I never said thank you.
<Page154>
I was discharged from the hospital soon after.
Afterwards, I wasn't sent back to the Tohno mansion, but to another house.
<Page155>
Although my body had recovered, I was still suffering from the after-effects of the accident and I became an unwanted child for the Tohno family.
But that's okay.
Tohno Shiki can do fine on his own.
<Page156>
He will lead a new life with a new family.
I leave the hospital room where I spent my tenth summer.
<Page157>
The curtains are still wavering.
I squint my eyes once again at the blue sky.
A light breeze announces the end of summer.

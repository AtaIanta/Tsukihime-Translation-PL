As everyone sleeps, my eyes open to the night’s cold air. 
It's pitch black tonight.
There is no one in the house.
<Page2>
The familiar smells of tatami mats and shoji paper.
A sky reminiscent of wooden bricks made from the hands of a craftsman.  
In the corner of the room, an old shadow is apparently stuck to the floor. 
It is a silence devoid of a single note, 
even the sounds of rustling clothes are absent.
<Page3>
I stand there frozen, absentmindedly waiting for someone.
In the sound of death, I remember the past.
The dreams I was having were all about what ifs.
For example,
<Page4>
No matter how long you wait, it will never end.
The night sinks deeper and deeper. 
By now, I know for sure there isn’t a soul left in this house. 
I'm so afraid of being alone. I want to see everyone. 
So alone, I went out to the garden.
<Page5>
“Oh.” Every time I breathe, my breath gets whiter and whiter. 
It's so cold in the garden that my fingertips are burning.
Frozen stars.
Deep darkness.
The cold light that illuminates the world. 
<Page6>
The thicket of grass. The feeling of stepping on it. The sound of empty sandals.
The garden of the mansion is very large.
Surrounded by a profound darkness.
The trees in the forest continue growing blacker and blacker.
It may as well be a wide curtain.
<Page7>
Just like in a theater somewhere.
The throbbing in my chest feels as though it’s blocking my throat.  
With a whoosh, the window of the treetop opens. 
I’m getting excited because the “theater” is about to start. 
<Page8>
The sound of buzzing insects worms its way into my ears. 
A cacophony of sounds can be heard in the distance.  
Beyond the veil of black trees, 
are the sounds of everyone making merry and enjoying themselves within the forest.
But the curtain has not opened yet.
Not yet.
Not yet.
<Page9>
Unable to contain myself, I waltz into the forest. 
<Page10>
It’s unbelievably dark. 
This forest is so deep that not even the cold light may reach here. 
So many sounds. 
So many things. 
But it’s so dark, I can’t make out any of it. 
If I passed someone along the way, I wouldn’t even be able to remember.
<Page11>
It's just so cold.
A winter cold that makes the back of my eyeballs go numb. 
I feel as though someone is calling my name. 
I walk further in.
<Page12>
After passing through the veil of trees,
I see everyone gathered in the forest’s square, waiting. 
Yet all their forms are disjointed. Devoid of structure.  
Their hands and feet are scattered. Torn limb from limb. 
The forest square’s whole surface is painted in the deepest red. 
<Page13>
A stranger is coming from over there.
Coming this way with a deadly weapon in hand. 
He looks like he wants to tear me apart just like everyone else. 
<Page14>
With empty eyes, I gaze at this person. 
At a total loss for what to do, I can only wait for the murder weapon.
However at the last second, someone jumps in front of me. 
And that person is torn to pieces instead. 
<Page15>
Splash.
Something warm splashes on my face.
Red.
Red water, like tomato juice.
That person, torn apart and dismembered.
The person who I called “mother”, 
will never call out my name again. 
<Page16>
... ... I really can't understand any of this.
It's just that I'm so cold.
I feel like I’m about to cry. 
<Page17>
I don’t want to look at the forest because it’s too dark. 
I don’t want to look at the ground because it’s too red. 
So I decide to raise my face to the sky instead.
<Page18>
The warm scarlet color bleeds into my vision.
It seeps into the back of my eye sockets.
But it doesn't bother me at all.
The night sky has but a single moon. 
<Page19>
That stranger, he’s
coming to make mincemeat out of me for sure this time.  
The sounds of his footsteps are gradually approaching. 
And yet somehow, I’m awestruck. 
I continue gazing at the infinite blue shadows. 
<Page20>
It's awfully strange.
I don't know why I didn't notice it before.
<Page21>
Aah...the moon, it’s so-
<Page22>
Before I realize it, that stranger is standing before my very eyes.
Without a sound, a thud of pain runs through me. 
It’s at the center of my chest.
Like an opened, dancing veil.
<Page23>
I can't see anything.
The world is gradually disappearing.
Yet in the midst of it all, it still shines beautifully.
<Page24>
Ah... I hadn't noticed.
The moon...
it’s so...beautiful...to...night.

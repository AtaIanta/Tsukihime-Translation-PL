―――I can't get rid of my doubts.
Sensei once told me.
...I'm not asking you to be a saint.
You can be the person you think is right, she said.
<Page2>
I know I'm not thinking straight at the moment, but I can't betray her trust.
<Page3>
Even if Arcueid is not human, she believes in me anyway.
With a smile, she said she forgave my unforgivable sin.
If that's the case―――then I should be ashamed of myself as a human being if I don't at least offer my life with a smile.
<Page4>
"...I'm an idiot.
I'm really an idiot...!"
<Page5>
With a smack, I slap myself on both cheeks and contemplate my next action.
I get up from the bench.
I'm not going back to the school or the mansion.
Without looking back, I run to the hotel once more.
<Page6>
I return to the hotel just in time as the sun would set soon.
<Page7>
"......"
I sneak back inside, silencing my footsteps.
If Arcueid is still asleep, there should be no problems for... now... however....
<Page8>
"―――"
"......Mmgh"
Just like that, she is already awake and is fuming with anger.
<Page9>
"Shi～～～～ki～～～～.....!"
"Aww, aww...!"
<Page10>
This is bad. This is really bad.
No matter how you look at it, she's furious, that <dear lady|mademoiselle> over there!
<Page11>
The same Arcueid who did all those things in the alleyway.
I sneaked away but I came back in time, you know! ...I'm afraid to even think what kind of ironhanded punishment I'm going up against. If she's not careful, the whole hotel would be split in half.
<Page12>
"N-No, I mean, this is!?"
It's too late to give an explanation now, but not doing so and getting myself killed is worse than running away, so I'll do my best to make excuses.
...However.
<Page13>
"Oh, where have you been?
You should have told me before you go outside!"
<Page14>
"...Huh?..."
Somehow... it's different from what I imagined it would be like.
<Page15>
"When I woke up at sunset, you were gone, you're not in the bathroom, and when I went to check on you to see if you were eating in the lobby, you weren't there either.
Just where have you been all this time?"
<Page16>
"........."
It is clear that Arcueid is angry.
But it doesn't seem like she thinks I betrayed her.
<Page17>
"...Oh, I was just out of the hotel for a bit or something..."
"Are you serious...? Now that the familiars have found you, even you are not safe. What are you going to do if that black panther attacks you again when you go outside so carelessly?"
<Page18>
...What's that now?
The reason Arcueid is angry isn't because I wasn't there.
She doesn't have the slightest thought that I would betray her and run away.
<Page19>
She is angry because she is just worried that I might be in danger for going out on my own.
<Page20>
"――――――"
...I'm ashamed. I was so close to trampling on her good intentions.
<Page21>
"Hey, Shiki, are you listening to me?"
"...Yeah, I'm listening. You're right, it was my fault.
I'm sorry I left without permission."
I bow my head sincerely.
<Page22>
"Eh...?# H-Hey, you don't have to apologize so seriously..."
<Page23>
"A-Anyway, you are too vulnerable. The enemy is a vampire, so you've got to be more careful."
<Page24>
"Or what, do you have a death wish or something? Are you trying to get yourself killed, or are you trying to piss me off?
If so, I can repeatedly go from my Fundamental State to my Excited State in a flash. Why don't I throw you into a space so absolute human speech can't describe it?"
<Page25>
"........"
This girl just said something horrible but with good intentions.
<Page26>
"Not a chance. Also, that's just called Hell. Don't underestimate human linguistic capabilities, you idiot."
<Page27>
"You were just as vulnerable yourself, you know. ...I mean, I've already killed you once, remember? It's crazy to sleep with me as your lookout.
You can't be sure that I won't do it again, can you?"

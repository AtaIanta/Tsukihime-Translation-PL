"――――――"
I still want to continue living in the proper, respectable world.
I do feel responsible for killing Arcueid.
But that doesn't mean I think it's fair to be forced to do something I can't do.
<Page2>
...Arcueid is asleep. She trusts me who killed her once already and is sleeping peacefully.
<Page3>
"......Damn it.....!"
But still, I'm not sure I'm up to it.
I have no reason to be here, no reason to believe that I can be of any help.
If I were to return to the "reality of Tohno Shiki", there is no better time than now.
<Page4>
The corridor is silent.
All the rooms on the top floor are rented out by Arcueid so it's just me and her on this floor.
<Page5>
"―――――――"
I still feel a lingering sense of hesitation.
But I shake it off and press the button for the elevator.
<Page6>
Taking the train from the hotel, I return to the city.
...The time is just past noon.
If I go to school now, I will not be able to make it in time for the fifth period.
If I go back to the mansion, crawl into bed, and fall asleep, I could forget about everything.
<Page7>
"........."
However, I don't feel like going back to the mansion.
I decide to head to the park to cool my head for a bit.
<Page8>
"―――――Hah."
A sigh escapes my lips.
I sit down on a bench and stare up at the sky in a daze.
<Page9>
A gray sky.
The cloudy, overcast weather is much like the scenery within my own mind right now.
<Page10>
...I wonder if that girl is still asleep, believing in me.
I killed her and yet she said she forgave me.
She said she forgave me and yet―――what the hell am I doing here?
<Page11>
...Last night.
I acknowledged my mistake in Senpai's room and vowed to make amends in my own way.
Was that a vow I could break when my life is in danger, wasn't it?
<Page12>
"........"
But I do want to live.
This is a problem that I can't escape from as long as I am alive and it's not something that can be dismissed as a moment of passion.
<Page13>
"―――That power is yours alone.
But that's the reason why you must never forget."
<Page14>
"――――"
It reminds me of some very important words from a long time ago.
What words did that person...Sensei, leave to me again?
<Page15>
"......"
I can still make it.
The sun has not yet set.
If I return to the hotel before the sun goes down, I can still start over.
<Page16>
"Damn―――――it."
I can't get rid of my doubts.
In end, I――――
C:>I think I'll go back to the mansion.
C:>I think I'll go back to the hotel.

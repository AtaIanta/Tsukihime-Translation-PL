...No matter how much she looks at me like that, I can't agree.
There is no way I could deal with the absurdity of a girl who could come back to life after being torn apart, or a black panther, or a burning corpse.
<Page2>
"...Sorry, but I can't help you. I'm just a student. I don't know what you're expecting, but if you're looking for a partner, look elsewhere."
"Hmm. Do normal students usually cut up girls they don't even know?"
<Page3>
I feel weakened when she puts it that way. On a scale of normal to abnormal, my eyes are in the same category as this person.
...But even that isn't at <t|・><h|・><i|・><s|・> <l|・><e|・><v|・><e|・><l|・>. 
I was living a normal life, never veering off the straight path. 
If only I hadn't met this unbelievable woman.
<Page4>
"No, you're wrong. I was a normal guy until I met you. I didn't want to kill anyone, and I was doing just fine.
...Right. That was the only time I was different. I'm a scumbag, yes, but I'd have been normal if I hadn't met you―――"
<Page5>
"Aahh enough, shut up!"
<Page6>
"―――!?"
The pupils of her red eyes open.
The girl's mood changes completely.
What a terrible chill.
I thought my heart is going to stop just from her staring at me.
<Page7>
"Don't get me wrong. You killed me.
Normally, I would have pulled your head off right here, but I'm saving you because you might be useful."
<Page8>
"―――――, Ah."
This is no exaggeration.
With just a stare, the world is transformed into a silent wilderness.
<Page9>
My burning throat and my trembling fingers freeze in an instant.
The <chill|fear> that runs down my spine takes over.
My instincts as a living creature are warning me.
<Page10>
What did I really get wrong, I wonder.
The thing I am looking at is just a killing machine in the shape of a person.
<Page11>
I can't breathe properly.
No, extra movements such as breathing are not allowed.
Breathing in. Turning my eyes. Moving my fingers. It doesn't matter. Whatever it is, if I move even slightly, the next thing I know, my body would be crushed by something enormous.
It is not an illusion, but an inevitable future that my instincts have sensed.
<Page12>
"―――,――――――"
My limbs thrash about, trying to escape now.
                     ――――――I don't want to die.
My thought processes do their best to put it together.
                     ――――――I don't want to die.
<Page13>
I'm gonna die soon. If I run, I die.
If I stay here, I die. If I move, I die.
But sooner or later, fear will kill my reason.
But if I make a sound, my limbs will be done for.
                     ――――――That's it. She'll kill me no matter what.
<Page14>
My spirit is being burned by that conclusion.
I am trapped in a conflicted escape.
<Page15>
My spirit is being cut out and folds endlessly.
It seems to go on forever, but suddenly it is over.
<Page16>
"Ah―――, AAAH."
I fall to the ground on my knees.
Released the pressure, I hug myself.
<Page17>
...Thank goodness. I'm still alive.
<Page18>
"How about it? I hope you understand your position a little better now."
<Page19>
...You think I can understand that?
I can only look up at this monster, struggling to keep my teeth from shaking and chattering.
<Page20>
"I'm not talking about what you can or can't do. If you do as I say, I'll let you live. If you don't, I'll kill you.
See, it's easy, isn't it? I'm simply asking you if you want to live or die."
<Page21>
"――――――"
I couldn't speak properly.
But instinctively, I nod my head.
<Page22>
"Alright. With this, we have a deal then."
The woman reaches out her hand to me while I'm on my knees.
<Page23>
"I'm Arcueid――― well, it's a bit of a long name, so you can just call me Arcueid.
I'm a vampire classified as a True Ancestor, what kind of human are you?"
<Page24>
I sigh heavily after being subjected to a self-introduction unlike any I have ever seen before.
...It's either a feeling of exhausted resignation, or perhaps acceptance of this unbelievable situation.
<Page25>
"I'm Tohno Shiki. Unfortunately, I'm just a student. ...I already mentioned this earlier, but I really am of no use to you."
<Page26>
I hold that gir――― Arcueid's hand and stand up. 
She looks at me carefully, and then,
asks me to shake hands with her.
<Page27>
"I look forward to working with you, Shiki.
I'll be sure to have you take full responsibility for killing me back then."
<Page28>
Arcueid smiles and holds out her left hand.
...I'm sure there are many responsibilities in the world, but I'm probably the first and last person to take responsibility for helping the person I killed.
<Page29>
"...Yeah, this really is insane."
But there's nothing else I can do about this.
I reluctantly hold out my left hand and shake hands with the girl in white who calls herself a vampire.

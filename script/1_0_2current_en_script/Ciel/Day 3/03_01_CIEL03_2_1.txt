...Let's eat in the classroom.
However, I don't have much of an appetite today.
If I eat at a time like this, I'll surely end up vomiting, so I think I'll be better off resting in the classroom...
<Page2>
"Hey Tohno, c'mon let's get some food."
"---"
What little appetite I have disappears when I see his stubborn face.
Okay, I'll skip lunch today. Thanks for the excuse, Arihiko.
<Page3>
"Sorry, I'll pass today. You can go on your own."
"What the hell, you're getting more unhealthy by the day!
What, is your new life as an aristocrat not suiting you after all?"
<Page4>
"You know, I' m not an aristocrat...ah, well, maybe you're right. If I'm not considered an aristocrat, then who is?
The bathrooms in the mansion are huge, Arihiko. They're bigger than your room. And more expensive too."
"Seriously!? I don't want to live uncomfortably like that."
<Page5>
...I take back my earlier comment.
Thank you, Arihiko, for your encouraging response.
It's a relief to hear something I can agree with wholeheartedly.
<Page6>
"...Well, it can't be helped if we're talking about the mansion itself, though.
Even if I get up at seven in the morning, they complain that I'm late, and the curfew is at 8 pm. On top of that, if I stay out overnight without permission, I'll get interrogated. It's like living in a prison, right?"
<Page7>
"Oh? That's a good story, isn't it?
The control system is a great thing, young people need to live tighter. You can't become a good adult if you start having fun while you're young.
"I agree, but it's more convincing when you say it."
That is the ultimate antithesis.
<Page8>
"Is that so? You're being awfully friendly today, Tohno.
Alright, I'll give you a piece of sweet bread then!"
"I'm fine. Don't worry about me, just eat. Lunchtime's almost over."
<Page9>
"Really? #Well then, more for me."
Arihiko clasps his hands together and begins to eat his bread.
Looking at him, he seems like a man who really appreciates his meals.
<Page10>
"Pardon me."
...And then.
Senpai comes over with what looks like a lunch box in her hand.
<Page11>
"Oh? Senpai, didn't you eat in the cafeteria already?"
"No, I don't have a specific place where I eat at. I just eat wherever I feel like."
<Page12>
She takes her lunch out of the cute drawstring bag.
The size of her lunch is a bit too large for a girl.
<Page13>
"By feel like you mean you were able to get up early today and made lunch, right?"
<Page14>
"Yes, I woke up a little before seven this morning, which is unusual for me...
Wait a minute, what are you making me say, Tohno-kun!?
<Page15>
"No, I wasn't trying to...Senpai, are you perhaps not a morning person?"
"Yes. Actually, I'm bad at waking up early.
When I'm volunteering, I tend to be pretty reckless."
<Page16>
"My parents owned a bakery, so I used to wake up early every day. Unfortunately, I was always bad in the morning. Growing up, my father would always get angry when I was a kid."
<Page17>
What? A bakery!?
Arihiko and I look at each other. I bet he's imagining Ciel-senpai having an oven in her room right now, kneading and baking flour with her white fingers.
<Page18>
"I fought with my father for three years, but in the end he said,
'I'd rather do the work of two people than train you!'
Then threw me out of the kitchen.
Since then, I've been quite flexible when it comes to when I wake up.
<Page19>
"Ahem.", says Ciel-senpai, looking quite proud of herself.
"Is that so? That's kind of surprising.
You seem like a very capable person."
<Page20>
"Yes, I try my best not to screw up in front of you. To be honest, I'm actually rather clumsy if anything."
<Page21>
...Surely, that's not a bad thing.
It's the same with her volunteer work.
People with amazing abilities don't do things that don't benefit them.
<Page22>
"I see. ---But I like clumsy people.
I feel at ease when I'm with them."
Arihiko agrees with me.
"So, does a late riser like you, normally go to the school cafeteria?"
<Page23>
"Yes, that's why I eat at the school cafeteria most of the time, but sometimes I make my own lunch like this. Usually, it's just a bunch of pre-prepared dishes.
You two prefer eating at the school cafeteria, don't you?"
<Page24>
"No, it depends on the mood we're in as well. When I was a freshman, I used to have my sister make lunch, but Tohno always ate bread or cafeteria food, so I would just eat wherever he was at."
<Page25>
"Huh, Tohno-kun is a moody guy, isn't he?"
"Yeah, you'll only get worn out if you go out with guys like him, so watch out, Senpai."
<Page26>
Senpai agrees with Arihiko, and opens the lid of her lunch box.
In the round lunch box, there are half rice and half side dishes. It is a very orthodox lunch box, but there seems to be a large amount of food.
<Page27>
"Then, let's eat.
Can I borrow your neighbor's chair?"
"The chair of a person who's not here is everyone's chair.
I'm sure Takada-kun would love to have you sit in his seat."
<Page28>
Senpai put her lunch box on her lap instead of on my desk and begins to eat.
Standing diagonally across from her is Arihiko, who is unwrapping his second piece of bread.
As I watch the two of them, I gaze out the window for no reason at all.
<Page29>
"Huh?ã€€Tohno-kun, aren't you going to eat?"
"Yes, I don't feel like it today."
<Page30>
"You're not eating...you're going to get hungry then."
"It's fine. I'm more concerned with my health than my appetite. Besides, I'm not so weak that I can't handle skipping lunch."
<Page31>
"Wow, that's amazing. I can't move if I skip even one meal. If I do, I get so starved that I collapse.
...It's embarrassing because I eat a lot more than most people, but I still get hungry easily."
<Page32>
"That's not true. You're a lot more developed than the other girls. #...It's natural that the bigger you are, the less fuel-efficient you are."
<Page33>
I'm not sure about what Arihiko said, but he handled the situation well.
Since she is still a teenager, I want her to continue to eat and grow to her full potential.
I can't tell if Senpai is ashamed or embarrassed by Arihiko's words.
<Page34>
"But Tohno-kun, are you sure you don't mind skipping lunch?"
"I'm fine with it. It's not unusual for me to skip meals for an entire day. I've eaten breakfast today, so I'm good to go until the evening."
<Page35>
"Mmm. I don't think that's a good idea.
You'll ruin your body if you live like that."
<Page36>
"Don't worry, there are people who check up on me.
My doctor has warned me not to put on weight, so it's better for me if I skip a meal now and then.
I want to be strong, but I have to keep my weight down."
<Page37>
"I-I see.
Even boys think about dieting, don't they?"
<Page38>
Senpai looks at me with upturned eyes and closes the lid of her lunch box after some thought.
<Page39>
"Well, I just remembered an errand I have to run, so if you'll excuse me.
Don't worry about me, I'd rather have you forget about today's conversation please."
<Page40>
After quickly cleaning up, Senpai rushes out of the room like the wind.
<Page41>
"---Mm, cute."
Arihiko nods his head in satisfaction, clearly impressed by what he had seen.

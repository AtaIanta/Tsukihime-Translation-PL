　Re....its red, its blood.
Because I dismemebered her apart, it's a disgusting colour that keeps flowing.
If that's the case, then I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to...
<Page2>
"---Stop. Stop it. Say the words in your mouth..."
　But my heart is screaming.
It's like it's going to explode if I don't get the truth out, the words, down my throat...
<Page3>
　No, no, no. No, no. No. No. No, no, no, no, no.
　No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. -----
<Page4>
"...... blood,huh."
　Don't turn your back on it. That's the difference.
"No, I'm telling you..."
　<No, no, no, no, that's not it.
<Page5>
"So, why ......!　I don't know this person, she's just a stranger I saw on the street. ......!
See, that's crazy!　Why am I killing a mere stranger? ......!"
<Page6>
Shouting won't get me an answer.
And I exactly know why.
When I saw her, I could only think of one thing.
<Page7>
"I'm ----"
　Yes, I...
　　　　　Tohno Shiki wants to kill that woman.
<Page8>
That's all I knew at the time.
My head was just melting, I just didn't try to put the image into words.
<Page9>
"Blood-----ugh "
I feel nauseous.
<Page10>
"Uh-uh, uh-uh."
The stuff in my stomach is coming back.
Vermilion soaks into my eyeballs.
<Page11>
"Ahhhhhhhhh!"
I run out.
I can't think of anything else to do.
I just wanted to get out of here, so I left the strange apartment in a half-crazed frenzy.
<Page12>
Stomach juices flow backwards.
I knelt down on the ground and vomited up all the contents of my stomach.
I vomited out all the food and gastric juice, crying.
<Page13>
There's nothing in my stomach.
And yet my body forced me to vomit, as if refusing to accept what had happened, as if trying to return to my normal routine.
<Page14>
It hurts.
It's like my insides are burning.
　The tears wouldn't stop, and my body crumbled to the ground like a piece of trash.
<Page15>
　　...... I killed a person.
　 I killed her as easily as if she were a doll, without any meaning, without mercy.
<Page16>
　I don't know why I felt that way,
　Why did I really kill her?
　I still don't understand the reason.
<Page17>
"------"
　But I don't care about myself.
　It's the endless regret and hatred that beats in my heart.
<Page18>
　I've killed that woman.
　Her whole life,
　The relationship between her and the people around her,
　The future she had always dreamed of, everything...
　I, who had nothing to do with her, destroyed it all with a laugh.
<Page19>
　...... Regret will not be forgiven.
　Even if you apologize, you will never be forgiven.
<Page20>
"I...what."
　I just want to pull my eyeballs out.
　I'm not even sure if I'm still sane.
　At that time, I couldn't even think of enduring or holding back.
"I'm going to kill that woman."
　I affirmed it as if it were a matter of course, and did it.
<Page21>
then...... the answer is simple.
　I must be crazy.
　Probably seven years ago.
　From an accident that should have killed me,
　But I was miraculously revived, and from that moment on...

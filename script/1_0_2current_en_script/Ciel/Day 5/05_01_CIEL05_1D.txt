I still my breathing and look around.
The Dead who are chasing us come to a stop.//It's the sound of their footsteps actually
<Page2>
The movements of the Dead are human-like but not nimble from the beginning to the end. Basically, they are sluggish.//Not consistently nimble, not nimble throughout
They only become move energetically when they perceive their prey. Their range is not that wide, maybe 10 meters at most.　
<Page3>
...... Whether they perceive by sight, hearing, or something else, there's no way for me to know unless I turn into one.
<Page4>
"... Haa. It's all good now Sensei. I'm sorry, that was rough.
It seems that they're gone, so let's calm down for now."
<Page5>
I let go of Noel-sensei's hand and examine my surroundings.
I actually wanted to curl up inside that hidden place, but I have to keep my composure now if I want to reassure Sensei.　
<Page6>
"They aren't here...? Is it safe here...?"
"Well, more or less. As long as we're here, I don't think we're truly safe. I just got dropped here too, so I don't understand what's happening... right, Sensei, why are you"//The first "here" in italics
<Page7>
In such a place... I couldn't even finish my question that I'm pinned to the wall.
<Page8>
"Noo, why isn't it safe!? Make it safe! I just came as student counsellor. When I heard about a suspicious part-time job exclusively for girls, I had to get involved right!? It's not like me to put in extra hours, but if by chance, just by chance, I see a girl I'm responsible for get taken away in front of me, I can't leave them alone...!"
<Page9>
"Wai... Sensei...! Calm down, not so loud, not so loud!"
<Page10>
"Hey why!? That's so strange, nothing makes sense! Why is there such a place below the department store!? Why are dead bodies moving!? Why hasn't anyone found this yet!? And, and, and---------"
<Page11>
"That's strange, that's strange, that's strange!
Why are you so calm...!"//That line in italics
<Page12>
Thud. She hits me on the chest with the heel of her palm.//If anyone has a better idea of what 拳骨の底 is... 
She says those words, half-crazed and with tears in her eyes.
<Page13>
"... That's"
After all, I knew from the start that I would be going into a vampire's den.
<Page14>
"Hey, aren't you afraid!? There's so many, a whole mountain of corpses!
A proper human wouldn't stay sane! There's no way you can be used to that...!"
<Page15>
"---------"
I have trouble breathing.
Noel-sensei's crying voice, as hysterical as it was, rightly points out my contradictions.
<Page16>
An impossible space.
An undergrave graveyard stretching out like an ant nest. Walking dead bodies.
Survivors eaten alive. 
A wall of corpses piled up inside the prison.
<Page17>
Look. This is Hell.
This is a darkness the living can never look straight at, nor get used to.
This is precisely because humans are rational, that they cannot maintain their sense of self here.
Sane people. Here. Have no other choice but to become animals no more intelligent than them. //Them in italics
<Page18>
"See, that's it!? I'm normal! I'm proper! It's those who are unfazed in such a place who have been crazy from the beginning!"
"......."
The woman's eyes are filled with hatred.
I was going to nod my head in agreement, but, exhale.
<Page19>
... After all, that's wrong.
I may not be able to express it well, but that's, definitely, wrong.
<Page20>
"... That's wrong Sensei. Certainly, my case is a bit special, but please don't be desperate Sensei.
Take a breath, calm down. You can endure this.
As much of a Hell this place this, I'm sure a decent person like you Sensei can endure this."
"Eeeeeh----?"
<Page21>
... That's right.
That's why we've been gifted with reason. Humans are rational so that they can withstand the terrifying reality.
Reason doesn't exist to be broken.
It exists to fight the things that are beyong our control, but that we have no choice but to overcome. That's what I remember I was taught a long time ago.
<Page22>
... Ironically.
That's something a good-for-nothing like me never managed to do.
<Page23>
"It's okay. Calm down, Noel-sensei"
"A... no, no way, nowaynowaynoway!
We're going die here...! Just now we were saved by luck, but we're going to die all the same!"
<Page24>
Noel-sensei complains with tears in her eyes, but the hatred that had been there earlier had disappeared from her eyes. 
It seems she herself hasn't noticed it, but she isn't panicking anymore.
<Page25>
"Then let's continue with that luck. Now we're two, you and me. If we help each other, we'll----"
"Uh... B-but, one or two people, that won't change anything!
After all, up to now I was with someone else too!"
<Page26>
"Wha...?"
Up to now, with someone else...?
<Page27>
"Wait a second. I'm sorry, I forgot to ask.
In the first place Sensei, how did you get dropped here?"
<Page28>
"W-well... That girl with our school uniform was talking with those two guys with knitted hats... they entered the department store... ignored the No Trepassing sign and went to the eighth, and when I shouted to tell them to stop, they put me inside the elevator."
<Page29>
Her story is pretty much the same as mine.
Those two are probably working for the vampire, and their is job is to bring down here unsuspecting people.
<Page30>
"And then, I was taken to that large room... The girl I was with, she acted as a decoy to help me escape."
<Page31>
"Yes, that was it... Just before she was captured, she told me to run and to call for help. S-s-shiki-kun, what do I do?! I... until now, I was so scare that I forgot about her...!"
<Page32>
"So there was another person...!?"
The composure I felt since Noel-sensei got saved, suddenly gave way to tenseness.
<Page33>
"When was that!?"
"Just a while before...!"
Thirty minutes... no, one hour... uh, uh... huh, how long ago was it... I'm sorry, I don't know!"
<Page34>
"………!"
I desperately try to think.
What should I do?
What can I do?
In the first place, what did I come here for?
<Page35>
"Do you remember where that large room was?"
<Page36>
"Wait, Shiki-kun, what are you thinking? Do, do you plan to go back!? Down there!? No, no way I'm telling you! There weren't just ten or twenty zombies!
No, more importantly----- You won't make it in time, and anyway, can you even think of a way to save them!?"
<Page37>
"I don't know if I can save that girl.
... But I have to at least check if she's still alive."
<Page38>
I take a deep breath and calm myself down.
I move away from Noel-sensei and turn my gaze to where the slope continues downward... towards the end of the path. 
What she just called "down there". There's a good chance that that I'll find that large room when I reach the end of the way.
<Page39>
"Y-you're going!? I-I won't go, I won't go!?"
"... Yeah. Sorry Sensei. If possible, I'd like you to wait here. It's safer than going together."
<Page40>
"I-irresponsible, that's irresponsible!? You're a boy, so you protect me right!?
In the first place, didn't you come to save me!?"
<Page41>
"... I'm sorry. That's, not the case.
Here, use this."
<Page42>
I hand her my knife as a strict-minimum tool of self-defense.
Apart for me, a single weapon like that one can't possibly drive back the Dead. Still, having a weapon should bring her peace of mind.
<Page43>
"Wah wah!? A knife, that's just a knife!? B-b-b-b-but Shiki-kun, what about you!? Do you have another weapon!?"
<Page44>
"If I find one, anyhow... Wait a bit, and if I don't come back, please run away without me Sensei."
"――――――"
<Page45>
I hand over my knife to Sensei and I walk away.
... I'm sorry but that's the extent of what I can do.
<Page46>
"Ahhhh wait! I'll go! I'll go so wait! Don't leave me alone! To begin with, a knife like that won't be enough! Yes, I'll give it back to you Shiki-kun!"
<Page47>
Noel-sensei grabs my arm and forcelly thrust the knife back at me. Without missing a beat, she then wraps her hands around my arm.
It's her way of showing she's determined not to be separated from me.
<Page48>
"I understand... To be honest, I'm glad. I'm relieved that you're with me, Sensei. Now, I'll be counting on you to try to make as little noise as possible."
"Mhm... yes, I won't. Trust me, I'll follow you properly."
<Page49>
... I dragged Noel-sensei into what I decided to do.。
At the very least, so that she doesn't get overwhelmed by fear, I tightly grip her hand.　
<Page50>
"I-it's okay... Shiki-kun, you're courageous, aren't you?"
"No way, not at all. If things get bad, I'll run way.
... Then let's go. Be careful where you step."
<Page51>
We walk brisky on the pathway, trying not to make any noise.
I wanted to break into a run, but that would attract the Dead and be counter-productive.//本末転倒 is thinking mistakenly that the unimportant thing is important, and vice versa, confusing, mixing the two up.
... Holding our breaths, Noel-sensei and I make our way even deep into the darkness below.

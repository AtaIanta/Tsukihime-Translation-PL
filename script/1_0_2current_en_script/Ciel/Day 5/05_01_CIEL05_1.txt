...... Arcueid is right. 
It is not wrong as a vampire to concentrate on restoring your own strength without considering other sacrifices. ...... No, it is not wrong as a method of warfare. 
<Page2>
"...... Yeah, I know. You're a vampire, right?" 
<Page3>
But no. 
I can't help but nod in agreement with Arcueid's policy. 
When I decided to fight, it wasn't for my own survival. 
<Page4>
"I know what you're going to do”. 
But can they really take you by surprise? They say sleeping mortals are cautious, but how dangerous can they be?" 
<Page5>
It reminded me of yesterday's Arcueid. 
Arcueid was completely defenseless as she fell asleep. 
Other animals are defenseless while sleeping, but this one was more defenseless than defenseless. ...... If it were a machine, I think it would have been "turned off". 
<Page6>
...... Then you have a chance to win. 
I can't even get close to a waking Vlov, but if he's asleep, I've got a definite way to kill him... 
<Page7>
“How dangerous is that? It's almost like attacking a castle.”
The dead will build a solid fortress and sleep in the depths of it. 
From the main gate to the deepest part is guarded by our family members, so it would probably be night by the time we break through. 
<Page8>
"By the time we break through, or ...... even when you're healthy, will Vlov's castle be tough to attack?" 
<Page9>
"Don't take it so lightly. If I had my druthers, I would have crushed the castle head-on. 
...... Well, that makes it easy for me to get away with it. 
The war dead have prepared an escape route in advance, and if an individual stronger than themselves comes along, they will run away at once. “
<Page10>
"...... if an individual stronger than you comes to ......." 
In other words, if one insignificant person comes along, there is a good chance that he or she will sleep without alarm. 
<Page11>
An advantage that Arcueid doesn't have, but I do. 
It would take a lot of shells to destroy the castle. 
But a handful of poison is enough to kill a single living thing. 
<Page12>
"I get it. You're right, it's going to be difficult for you and me to attack. 
Is Vlov's stronghold really that dangerous at ......? No, I'm talking about the size, the number of minions, etc." 
<Page13>
"Well, on the difficulty level, I think it's a place to go down rather than inside. It's more of a maze than a castle, and it's just using a department store.
Yeah, I'm sure that's the entrance. I'm sure of it." 
<Page14>
"Department store?" 
Not the unfamiliar jargon of vampires, but a department store kind of department store? 
<Page15>
"That's it. The big one in front of the park at the north exit. 
It's well hidden, but it's a nest of the dead. I think the food is being sent to the lord from that department store." 
<Page16>
"Oh, you mean that department store? No, no, more importantly, is there a vampire house in the centre of town?” 
<Page17>
"What? I didn't make it! 
Ants and bees nest in your house, don't they? 
It's the same thing. Dead people are parasites on human blood, so the closer their home is to a human city, the more efficient they are. 
<Page18>
"It's ------." 
I turn away from Arcueid, who speaks as if it were natural. 
...... I reaffirmed my resolve. 
If he's such a familiar pest, I'm not going to give him another moment's notice. 
<Page19>
......it was a good idea. 
Arcueid couldn't do it. 
I'll do what I can on my own.

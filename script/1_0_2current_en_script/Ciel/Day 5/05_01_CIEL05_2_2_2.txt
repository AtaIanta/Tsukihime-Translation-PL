"Ugh————!"
I restrain my urge to run over to Senpai, and look back to Noel-sensei.
<Page2>
I tell myself that I made a choice. I decided that I would do what is feasible to me. 
Even if I rushed over to Senpai, I would just be caught in the explosion. 
<Page3>
"Noel-sensei...!"
I hold in my arms Noel-sensei, who lay unconscious on the floor. 
If I leave her like that, she's be buried alive. 
<Page4>
"Haa... haa, ha...!"
Gasping for air, I dash to one of the pathways. 
By eye, there's still twenty meters to go.
The collapse of the cavity is by now inevitable. 
I push to the back on my mind the thought that, alone, I would have made it.
<Page5>
Carrying Noel-sensei, I get out of the room, just like Senpai told me to do.
<Page6>
"—————— Aaa"
——— That.
Was what I so arrogantly thought, 
Without even having the time to have any regrets. 
<Page7>
That last vain struggle was truly pointless.
I bring Noel-sensei down my back and lay her on the ground. I embrace her and brace for the unavoidable mass about to fall on us.
<Page8>
Sand and debris fall down all around.
Without offering resistance, in a mere instant, Tohno Shiki disappears from this world.

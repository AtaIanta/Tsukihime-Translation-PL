"It's..."
Obvious that I'll help Senpai...!
<Page2>
I run feverishly after Senpai.
It is at night that a vampire can make us of their full power. 
If I have to defeat him, it has to be during daytime, right now. 
In order to avoid any more sacrifices like last night at the hotel, Senpai heads towards Vlov, aware that she was at a disadvantage.
<Page3>
Then there's no way I can run away.
I'm still unhurt, I don't have a headache, and I have stamina to spare.
<Page4>
If I can just get close to Vlov one more time,
Even if I can't kill him,
I should at least be of some help to Senpai———!
<Page5>
"You're in the way———"
At this point, one or two zombies is nothing to be afraid of.
I ready my knife to cut the lines of the Dead that stand in my way.
Before I could close the distance, they explode in a chain reaction.
<Page6>
Nonsense.
Even after all the warnings Arcueid gave me, I still don't understand him.
From the beginning, he never had the slightest intention to 'fight a human'.

"————— Tohno-kun, no...!"
Her dissuasive words don't reach me in time. 
... My desire to be of help just caused her trouble. 
In the middle of the huge falling mass of earth and sand, Senpai's words were the last thing I heard.

The white curse blows violently.
In the midst of it,
Something,
Even with my eyes,
I couldn't see the bottom of,
This dark hole.
<Page2>
"The Twenty-Seven Ancestors! No way, he's one of them!? Why is such a big name now, and of all places right here in this city!?"
<Page3>
Senpai shouts in the middle of the blizzard.
The large room was completelly frozen.
<Page4>
... Trying to exhaust his blood was a mistake. Compared to the flames from earlier, this is many times more vicious.
<Page5>
Senpai lost.
She shouldn't have exhausted that vampire. 
On a full stomach, he was a foe that could be defeated in one go...! 
<Page6>
"Tohno-kun, outside! You won't hold one minute here!"
"W-Well, I'll run, but what about you Senpai!?"
"Urgh... Facing an Ancestor with my current equipment... Be that as it may, I have to defeat him while it's still daytime!"
<Page7>
Inside the white storm, she breaks into a run. 
Her target is that motionless vampire, Vlov. 
Maybe because of the pain, he couldn't even stare at Senpai.
<Page8>
... If so, we have a chance at victory. 
If she can get close to him, or even just draw closer to him, she can still win. 
<Page9>
However Vlov and Senpai are separated by around thirty meters. 
In addition, he was surrounded by some of the surviving Dead. 
There's no way I could reach him.
Even for Noel-sensei, this would be a difficult situation.
<Page10>
She swept away such adversity in one swing of the arm.
Five consecutive shots of a blade thin like a needle.
In the blink of an eye, a total of ten zombies on either side of her were skewered and brought to a stop. She quickly made her way through them, closing in on the motionless Vlov. 
<Page11>
'Victory...!'//The game makes unclear who speaks/thinks this line, Shiki or Senpai
I wonder who was certain of the victory, Senpai, or I.
Vlov snaps his fingers.
The resulting fallout was ill-matched to middle of this white storm.//Resulting fallout for 反応, 
<Page12>
The Dead that Senpai brought to a stop.
The gas contained in their stomach ignites in response to Vlov's signal.
<Page13>
"Wha...!"
Covered by the blizzard and the dust, Senpai was nowhere to be seen.
Even worse, that vampire had no sense of self-preservation.
<Page14>
Already with those flames that only burn human bodies and with the blizzard, but this is even worse.//Or is it saying that the blizzard is what's worse than the flames?
What should be most feared underground is a cave-in. If the pillars supporting the ceiling are blown off, everyone will certainly be buried alive...!
<Page15>
The cavity is collapsing.
Vlov didn't think of anything.
He just automatically attacked the approaching enemy. 
<Page16>
Think. This is my final move.
I———
C:> Rush over to Senpai.
C:> Rush over to Sensei.

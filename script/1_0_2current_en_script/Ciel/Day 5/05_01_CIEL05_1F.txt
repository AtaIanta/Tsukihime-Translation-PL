"Kyaaaaaaaaaa!"
"Noel-sensei....!"
<Page2>
A fraction of second, and then, a single blow. 
Blue flames rushing past like a locomotive. 
The phosphorescent fire I saw at the hotel, that burns only human bodies. 
Not only burning her,
<Page3>
"Ah------ aaa, ------!"
It transforms into a hand made of blue flames, grabbing her body and pulling the pitiable sacrifice to the source of the flames... to the entrance connecting to some pathway. 
<Page4>
The vampire was standing at the entrance of the passageway.
Vlov.
A demon that sucks the blood of humans and burned to ashes the guests of the hotel.
Like last time, he was holding a woman in his arms. 
<Page5>
"N-No----- What's that, I never thought------ what!?"
<Page6>
Engulfed by the blue flames, the woman screams.
The Dead had alreay been carbonised, but the woman still retains her original form.
The reason is obvious.
If he burned her, he wouldn't be able to suck her warm blood.  
<Page7>
"Ah----- n-no
Stop... Stop, stop, stoooop!!"
<Page8>
Her scream reverberates.
Her nun outfit was ripped, exposing her appetizing neck where, as if falling upon her from behind, the vampire lays his fangs.
<Page9>
"----- Ugh"
My mind sharpens.
My perception of time freezes.
I won't make it. There's absolutely no way I can make it in time.
That's an obvious truth that anyone---even the female student standing next to me----can see.
<Page10>
Even if I start running, it won't change anything.
Even if I sprint, it's already too late.
Still,
C:>I will save Noel
C:>I will abandon Noel

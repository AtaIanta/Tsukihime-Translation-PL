"What's the matter, Senpai? You don't look happy."
"What? Well.., #I was a little surprised that Tohno-kun seemed to be more relaxed."
<Page2>
"No, my family has always been strict, so I'm just used to this kind of thing.
...More importantly, Senpai, what did you want to talk to me about?"
<Page3>
"Yes . I hadn't thanked you for this morning. You must have been bothered by what happened on the train. I wanted to service you like this as an apology."
With a soft smile on her face, Senpai says something outrageous.
<Page4>
"U-um, you're using Japanese wrong, Senpai."
"Oh, really? Well, isn't being polite and hospitable called servicing......?"
<Page5>
"I can't say. I don't think it's wrong, but it's not quite right either."
<Page6>
"...Hmm, is that so? I'm sorry, I unknowingly said something strange. After all, you really shouldn't speak in a manner that doesn't match your heart."
<Page7>
Senpai slumps her shoulders.
...I feel sorry for her when she is so remorseful.
<Page8>
"...Well. Your heart was in the right place. To be honest, it made me happy to hear it.
They say etiquette comes first from the heart, and if one's feelings are genuine, minor mistakes can be laughed off."
I encouraged her.
<Page9>
Senpai was staring at me intently.
...Her eyes are so serious that I feel as if I'm a rare animal in a zoo.
<Page10>
".........."
"...Senpai?"
It's partly because I'm not used to it, but it's really embarrassing to be stared at like this.
<Page11>
"Tohno-kun, you look too good.
You're younger than me, but you're so calm and cocky."
<Page12>
Senpai glares at me disapprovingly.
This is the second time, but I still can't understand her thought process at all.
<Page13>
"I'm sorry. That was kind of an arrogant thing to say, wasn't it?"
"Yes. You were so cocky, I was unintentionally touched. It's kind of embarrassing to have a younger boy do that to you."
<Page14>
Despite her words, Senpai smiles happily.
I'm sure she's not angry...
<Page15>
"I really want to know more about Tohno-kun.
I'd be happy to talk to you about anything."
"...It's fine, but...
It's boring to talk about me, Senpai."
<Page16>
"No problem," Senpai replied with a smile.
...It can't be helped. I'm not sure if I can live up to her expectations, but let's just talk about what happened at school―――
<Page17>
...We ended up talking for about an hour.
Senpai was happy to listen to any kind of conversation, which was fun, but I was exhausted because it wasn't something I was used to.
<Page18>
One of the most popular topics was about the school trip. Senpai didn't go on it because she caught a cold the day before.
<Page19>
"You were in the second year of junior high school, so you must have been 14.
I would have liked to have seen you at that age."
Saying that with such a smile, I couldn't help but blush.
<Page20>
There was no end to the conversation, but the sun would soon set.
I was forgiven by my senpai, and left the tea room with my hair pulled back.

<Page1>
.......But... I am curious.
<Page2>
"------"
The splendid sweep of her legs are perhaps the embodiment, or maybe the crystallization, of living energy.
Though still, they embodied the lively motion of smoothly flowing water.
This is what I would call beauty in form. Forget about taking my eyes off, I'm actually being drawn to them.
<Page3>
"Um, ...... Tohno-kun?"
<Page4>
Then I realized that beauty and strength go hand in hand.
They're meaty, but the truth is, these are sprinter's legs.
According to a rumor, she set a new school record in the physical fitness test the other day, beating out the track team. These are the legs of a 13-second 100-meter runner....... I feel like I'm looking at a living gem.
<Page5>
"Umm, you know, your face is very close to my.... and the movement of your hands...."
"I'm sorry. I am in the middle of a serious conversation."
"Huh? What? Serious?"
<Page6>
Unfortunately, I am neither her trainer nor her rival athlete.
And you don't just wake up one day and suddenly get intrested in running and speed.
<Page7>
"Oh, but I can't understand what you're serious about!!"
That's true. I don't understand either.
<Page8>
How can I put into words the psychology of being attracted to beautiful things?
However, the situation where you cannot honestly say that something is beautiful is also wrong, isn't it?
When will human beings be able to transcend all prejudices and discriminations and talk about the essence of things? 
<Page9>
"Ouch!?"
"Tohno-kun, are you all right!?
You just got bonked in the head with something!?"
"...Yes, somehow I'm alright."
<Page10>
While holding back the pain in the side of my head, I pick up the object that fell on the seat.
A metallic, shiny, palm-sized hunk of metal.
It's a smartphone, no matter how you looked at it.
<Page11>
"Excuse me. Did something fly over here?"
"...... Maybe this. It was flying really fast. Is there an app on it that lets you fly it around?"
<Page12>
"You're an idiot. Thank you very much."
The girl took the phone as if nothing had happened and walked away to a door one block away.
<Page13>
"……………"
"……………"
I was staring at Senpai for too long.
<Page14>
Anyway, I came back to my senses.
I cleared my throat to change the atmosphere.
<Page15>
"I'm sorry, I got a little distracted.
But what's wrong, Senpai? You're not in club activities, are you? I can't believe you're coming to school at this hour."
<Page16>
"No, I'm on my way back from a volunteer activity.
You know that trash pickup in the park that the student council organized? I was just doing that."
<Page17>
When she said that, It made sense to me.
Senpai looks good in glasses and she's always working hard for other people.
<Page18>
"It was just an early morning service for half an hour.
Everyone else had already gone home, but I thought I'd just go back to school since it was too much trouble."
<Page19>
The bag on Senpai's shoulder makes a clanking noise.
I thought it was something used for club activities, but it seems to be a cleaning tool.
<Page20>
"Oh. Do you want to see what's inside? You're so bold to check out your senpai's belongings, even though you look so quiet."
<Page21>
Senpai leans closer to my face.
...Her face is so close that I can smell her and I'm not even sure where I should be looking..
<Page22>
"N.. no, it's not that, but if you have a folding broom or a rake, that would be unusual....
<Page23>
"Ho ho, If you'd like to see my all-purpose shears.Then come to the tea ceremony club after school. You're more than welcome."
<Page24>
I feel embarrassed when she says that with a soothing smile.
Not able to give a witty reply, I say, "Yeah."
I don't know where the tea ceremony club room is, but I can find that out later.
<Page25>
"You have my word. Between you and me, we have a surplus of tea cakes that we purchased with club funds. It's not something that lasts forever, so we need energetic boys like you."
<Page26>
"Oh, I see. If your schedule permits, by all means.
But do you think I'm a cat? Luring me with food."
<Page27>
I got caught up in her friendly smile and started to talk lightly as well.
Senpai with green ribbon...
<Page28>
"I think you're more of a puppy.
I mean, cats are not good. In end, it's canines that can be relied on, because they're disciplined and smart!"
She seems to be proud of them and showed an obsession that I could not understand.
<Page29>
Since we were going to the same destination, our conversation continued.
We talked about the mid-term exams that had ended last week.
About the gymnastic festival, which was reduced in scale and ended in one day.
About the cafeteria, where the menu has not been changed yet.
About the controversy between the students and the school over the use of mobile devices, we both sighed, so we changed the topic and laughed about our impressions of a movie we had recently seen.
<Page30>
Fifteen minutes flew by.
She is a good talker, and as they say, "well liked by both men and women."
We regretted the fact that we would be arriving at Souya Station in a few minutes, and started talking about the next topic.
---But...
<Page31>
"Hey, you're making too much noise."
As you can see, we forgot about our surroundings.
<Page32>
Me and Senpai bowed to apologize.
"……………"
<Page33>
"......We've made her angry."
"......Sorry .
I was laughing too loud, I guess."
<Page34>
After that, there was no more conversation.
The friendly atmosphere we had just experienced seemed to be a lie.
Everyone is just a stranger, and the silence peculiar to a city dominates the train.
<Page35>
The train arrived at Souya Station.
It is just before 7 am.
It is too early for school, and the city has not yet woken up.
It is quiet now, but in another hour it will be full of people and cars.
<Page36>
"Traffic is still light this morning, isn't it? The city seems to be waking up late these days. I wonder if everyone is staying up late."
Senpai says something strange while carrying her heavy luggage.
<Page37>
"Um... Can I take your luggage to school?"
"What? Oh, no, no, don't worry about it. I have a stop to make, so I'll leave you here."
<Page38>
Then, with a smile and a wave of her hand, Senpai ran off.
It was such a light and fast run that an onomatopoeic sound like "bubun" would be appropriate.
<Page39>
I feel like running along with her, but there is no reason to hurry.
I'm going to head to school at my usual pace, because I have to take care of my body.
<Page40>
.......
The girl from earlier comes out of the ticket gate.
She walks past me at a fast pace,
<Page41>
"You're too animalistic.
Don't you feel embarrassed to be doing that in a public place?"
,and leaves me with a strong criticism.

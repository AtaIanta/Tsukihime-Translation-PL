......I'm still not prepared to return to the Tohno house.
I don't have anything in particular to do, but maybe I should wander around the school to calm down......?
<Page2>
Suddenly, I remember that I had made a promise this morning to meet someone.
"......That's right.
I told her on the train that I was going to stop by the tea ceremony club."
<Page3>
It's just a coincidence that I remembered it this way.
There's still time, so I'll go to the tea ceremony room.
<Page4>
The tea ceremony club room is located at the end of the club activity building.
About ten minutes have passed. The reason why it took me so long to find the tea ceremony club is that no one knew where it was.
In the end, I went to the staff room and found the location of the tea ceremony room on the floor plan.
<Page5>
"Excuse me. Senpai, are you there?"
I knocked on the side door and called out.
Soon after.
<Page6>
"Oh. Look who's here, it's Tohno-kun."
The familiar face of Ciel-senpai appeared.
<Page7>
"Have you come to visit me, by any chance? Yeah, that must be the reason!
Well, if that's the case, come on inside! I just wanted to talk to you as well."
"......oh, huh. Well, then, pardon my intrusion."
<Page8>
Although I was a little embarassed by her forcefulness, I did come here to talk to Senpai.
I walked into the tea room obediently.
<Page9>
The club room was more authentic than I had expected.
Or rather, it was a completely Japanese-style room.
"I'm surprised....... I didn't know that our school had such a classroom. Isn't this a hobby room or something?"
<Page10>
"I think so too. Formally, it was supposed to be for club activities, but I guess it was the principal's hobby.
However, it seems that this room wasn't being used until I joined."
<Page11>
Senpai went ahead of me to the tatami mat and began preparing tea.
"It wasn't being used until Senpai joined......?"
<Page12>
"Yes, that's right. It's a shame that the tea ceremony club had become an imaginary club with no members!
Sweets are a stabilizer for the mind. To think that a way of conveying the excellence of Japanese sweets had fallen into disuse, it's like a smile disappearing, no, like abandoning a puppy on a rainy day!"
<Page13>
"So, I asked the teachers to let me restart the tea ceremony club. I'm still the only member of the club, so it's just temporarily operational until we have five members.
"I-I see. You really like sweets, huh."
But I don't think that's the point of the tea ceremony.
<Page14>
Yes. Western ones are my favorite, but I won't discriminate amongst carefully made sweets.
<Page15>
"Anyway, as the leader of the tea ceremony club, I've been steadily recruiting people. Thanks to that, I'm allowed to use the club room freely like this after school and during breaks.
If there's anything you need, Tohno-kun, please let me know. I'm usually here after school.
"O-oh, really?"
<Page16>
It's a mixture of public and private, like some kind of secret base.
It's an honor to be invited by Ciel-senpai to join the tea ceremony club, but will that be enough to revive it?
<Page17>
"But you're a curious person too, Tohno-kun. It's true that I invited you, but I didn't expect you to come all the way to the tea ceremony room. Are you a predator in spite of your appearance?"
<Page18>
The back of my neck went red at her teasing voice.
I didn't want to hit on her, I just wanted to drop by... I was about to say that, when I realized that it was only an excuse.
<Page19>
"No... really, there was no particular reason..."
It's no wonder that Ciel-senpai pointed it out.
She only asked me to come if I was interested, which is something I wouldn't normally do.
"...Oh, I'm sorry. I think I put too much pressure on you."
<Page20>
Senpai muttered to herself and clapped her hands together.
"------"
I squinted at the red sunlight through the window.
While I was distracted by the oddities of the tea ceremony room, Senpai took a cushion from the closet and placed it on the tatami.
<Page21>
"......"
Tea is tea, but this looks like a really serious tea ceremony.
<Page22>
"Excuse me, Senpai. I'm not well versed in this sort of etiquette......"
"That's no problem. I only know about pouring tea. Tohno-kun, feel free to make yourself comfortable."
<Page23>
I was served a teapot, a teacup, and some tea cakes.
The snacks were miniature cakes and rice crackers sold at convenience stores for a certain price per bag, so it seems to be a place for just drinking tea and chatting.
<Page24>
"We're just here to chat, so let's not get too formal. That's no fun.
You don't have to sit upright or anything, you can just cross your legs, okay?"
<Page25>
She smiled softly and poured tea into teacups for the two of us.
"....... I don't know whether she's serious or generous, but I don't understand her."
I picked up the offered teacup and took it to my mouth.
<Page26>
Although I was never involved, the Arima family was the head of a tea ceremony school. Perhaps because I grew up in such a house, I am accustomed to spending time drinking tea in a Japanese-style room.
<Page27>
Consuming tea slowly, as if drinking time itself.
...........but
Senpai was looking at me with a troubled expression.

<Page1>
During the lunch break, the corridor is crowded with students passing by.
Most of them head for the cafeteria, but some of them visit their friends' classes with their lunch boxes in hand, or head for the courtyard or the gym.
<Page2>
As I mingle with them, I am wondering whether I should have a solid lunch in the cafeteria or buy a loaf of bread at the store,
<Page3>
At the end of the corridor, I saw a familiar figure of a Senpai.
<Page4>
"......?"
Is it my imagination?
Or is she coming straight towards me......?
<Page5>
"Thank God, I've been looking for you, Tohno-kun.
You saved me the trouble of having to visit your classroom."
<Page6>
"W..Well, that's great. Hello, Ciel-senpai."
For some reason, I felt embarrassed and replied with a lackluster greeting.
<Page7>
"Yes, hello.
But we've already met today, so 'hello' is not the right word."
"Oh....y..yeah. That's right."
<Page8>
I look away, feeling more and more embarrassed.
I wonder why that is....
I'm used to talking to Senpai, but today I'm unusually conscious of her. I wonder if it's because she saw me absorbed in my thoughts this morning.
<Page9>
"...... Tohno-kun? You seem somewhat restless, do you have some urgent business?"
<Page10>
"No, I'm not in a hurry at all."
I can't say that I'm just curious about every move she's making.
"Anyway, senpai, you were looking for me, is there something I can help you with?"
<Page11>
"Yes. I'm sure I caused you some trouble this morning.
I wanted to apologize for that, so I've been looking for you."
<Page12>
"Trouble in the morning...... Oh, you mean the train?
But that was more of a blessing than a trouble."
It was fun talking with Ciel-senpai.
Thanks to that, I didn't notice how long it took to get to the station.
<Page13>
"But you got yelled by the girl because of me.
I apologize for that. If you don't mind me asking, are you going to have lunch now, Tohno-kun?"
"Yes. I was just wondering if I should go to the cafeteria or just buy something."
<Page14>
"Great, then I can join you. I'll buy you a drink as an apology for this morning, so let's go to the cafeteria now."
"Huh?"
She said this with a smile, grabbed my arm and started walking.
<Page15>
A third-year student standing in the hallway of a second-year student is enough to stand out, but this is even more noticeable.
All the students in the hallway are looking at me and Senpai.
<Page16>
"H..Hey, wait a minute......!
That thing in the morning was my fault too, so it's not something for you to apologize for...! In fact, it's the other way around. I should be the one apologizing!"
I realize that I'm blushing right now, and move a bit away from Senpai.
<Page17>
"Oh. That's not nice to hear. It was you who should have apologized? So in other words, as a punishment you will do me a favor, right?"
<Page18>
"------"
The teasing glances of Senpai made my already red cheeks even redder.
<Page19>
"No, that was just a figure of speech."
"Then give it up and let me take you to the cafeteria.
I was in the mood to have lunch with someone. Consider it bad luck and let me buy you a drink."
<Page20>
......Unfair.
If someone smiles at you like that, you can't say no.
<Page21>
"....I can't call it bad luck Senpai"
<Page22>
"I really enjoyed talking to you in train.
So let's hurry to the cafeteria!
If we don't hurry, we'll run out of seats!"
<Page23>
Ciel-senpai took my hand again and started to walk down the corridor.
<Page24>
The tables in the cafeteria were empty, maybe because it was not too crowded.
There was a reasonable queue at the counter, and it should take about five minutes to order...
<Page25>
"I'll take my place in line. Tohno-kun, please save a seat for me. Is there any food you don't like? If there is, I'm asking you now. "
<Page26>
"No, I don't have many likes or dislikes in food."
"That's a very good answer.
Then, I'll be off in a flash."
<Page27>
Without waiting for my reply, Ciel-senpai got in line to order.
".................."
I guess I'll just have to eat like an adult today.
<Page28>
"Vacant seats for two ...... I'd prefer corner if I could find. ......"
I'm not sure my mind can handle this whole situation of having lunch with Ciel-senpai.
<Page29>
So I'd prefer to seat in a place where I can't be seen by many people.
Looking around the cafeteria, I see that there is an empty seat in the middle, but the corner table is already occupied by another students' belongings.
At this hour, there are no corner seats for two people.
"---, There it is."
<Page30>
".......Huh?"
However, the table is about to be occupied by a familiar face.
<Page31>
"Yo, Tohno, here, come here."
<Page32>
Without a care about the world, an orange-haired delinquent student is waving his hands in the air. It's a real headache.
<Page33>
But it's not as bad as it looks, and there are no other empty corner seats.
Also, he is a man who can keep people away. It is my duty as a friend to make good use of him anyway.
<Page34>
"Too late . Didn't I tell you there'd be a special guest today? Don't take it easy on me while I'm working as an executive."
<Page35>
"Oh, I remember you saying that.
So, where is this special guest?"
<Page36>
"Well, that's the thing. I've been trying to schedule it since yesterday, but she refused this morning saying "I'm busy at lunch today because there's someone I want to apologize to."
His shoulders slumped in disappointment while he ate his bowl of udon.
<Page37>
"...someone she wants to apologize to."
That sounds all too familiar.
"That special guest, is she from third year?"
"Ooh!"
<Page38>
"A short haircut that looks good with glasses, moving around energetically, yet giving off a dependable air?"
"What the hell, when did you steal my brain?"
"......No, that's not it, it's just...."
<Page39>
"Sorry for the wait.
Are you sure you want to sit here, Tohno-kun?"
<Page40>
Senpai came to me with a bright smile.
In her hands she is carrying trays for 2 people."
<Page41>
"What the hell!?"
"Hmm? Inui-kun,#What a coincidence."
Senpai took a seat quite gently."
She was facing me, who was sitting next to Arihiko.
<Page42>
"O---oo, OOoOO!?"
Arihiko makes an unfamiliar sound. Perhaps he can't cope with the sudden good fortune. I know how he feels because that's what I was like just now.
<Page43>
"Come on in, Tohno-kun.
Don't hesitate to fill up on food today."
<Page44>
And there's no way I can say no to a smile like that.
I gave up and sat down on the seat facing Ciel-senpai.
<Page45>
"Well, thank you very much."
I clasped my hands together and looked down at the tray that Senpai had brought.
<Page46>
"......?"
On the tray there was, #Curry rice #Curry udon #and more Curry rice.
"....................."
Wait,what??
<Page47>
"Um, senpai ......?"
"Yes? What is it, Tohno-kun?"
"...what does this mean?"
<Page48>
"What do you mean, it's lunch for you and me. What else can it be?"
"...Yes, but I can only see curry....."
<Page49>
"Of course, it's everyone's favorite, classic curry."
You don't have to tell me that. The problem is that there is only curry.
<Page50>
"...you bought three dishes."
"Of course. You're a boy, so you should eat a lot. I'm fine with just one dish, so please choose whatever you like."
<Page51>
"...Then I'll have curry rice and curry udon."
Any other combination will just be having same dish twice...
<Page52>
"Please don't leave any food behind.
Tohno-kun, you're not a picky eater, right?."
"--------"
There was not a trace of malice in the her smile.
It was not a joke or a tease, but a perfect good intention without a speck of evil.
<Page53>
"Itadakimasu"
I got carried away and dipped my spoon into the curry rice.
and
"Son of a bitch, Tohno-kun!"
The man who's been quiet for the past few minutes has finally woken up.
<Page54>
How long are going to keep giving your dear best friend the cold shoulder!? You should be like “Hey! Thanks for always being alive, Inui-kun! Oh! By the way, I should totally introduce you to my beautiful senpai today! Oh no! Something came up! Time to go behind the school!” Then we can chit chat about all kinds of stuff! And if you have any curry udon left over, you can give it to me!
"I won't. But thank you for always being alive, Inui-kun."
<Page55>
Arihiko's arm stretches out to me.
I skillfully guard the curry udon from those evil hands.
<Page56>
"Eh? Inui-kun, do you know Tohno-kun?"
"What are you talking about? We've known each other since middle school, we're buddies!"
A close friend of mine who's always energetic and stressfree.
<Page57>
"I see. I'm sorry I broke my promise. You see, the person I caused trouble for this morning was Tohno-kun."
<Page58>
"It's okay, it's for a good reason. I would've taken Tohno out myself if you'd told me his name.
How bad this guy can go?"
<Page59>
"We bumped into each other on the train early in the morning, and while we were chatting another passenger got angry.
It's no good, I should have thought about the people around you. It wasn't Tohno-kun's fault, but he got yelled on because of me."
<Page60>
"Oh an early morning train. People are free to talk as they like, but you should......# Wait. Early morning? I know Tohno does, but do you come to school by train as well?"
<Page61>
"I was volunteering this morning. Picking up trash in the park.
It was on the school bulletin board, remember? Students were asked to participate voluntarily."
<Page62>
"Ah, that thing at the seaside park... As expected of Senpai, thank you for your hard work.
But the teachers rely on you because you do that. I hope you don't let them get carried away, because they will slack off whenever they feel like it.
<Page63>
"It's okay, I do it because I like it.# And the teachers are thinking about the school. I don't like the way you're talking about them, Inui-kun."
<Page64>
Ciel-senpai rebukes Arihiko's lazy opinions.
From the looks of it, he seems to be close to senpai in his own way.
<Page65>
"Senpai, do you do volunteer work every day by any chance?"
"What, Tohno, you don't know? Ciel-senpai is such a handy person that she's called the true student council president."
<Page66>
"I know. You're the perfect Senpai who can solve anything, unlike the student council who only have titles."
<Page67>
"Oh. In the first year, there's even a fan club, and whenever something troublesome happens, the teachers say, 'You'll be safe if you talk to Ciel'. Nowadays, the teachers wouldn't complain no matter what Senpai does."
Arihiko says it proudly as if he was talking about himself.
<Page68>
"...... I didn't know about the fan club. You're an amazing person, Ciel-senpai. It's a big deal to be counted on by the teachers, that's for sure."
I looked at senpai with admiration.
<Page69>
"Oh, y..yea..Well, thank you very much."
<Page70>
Senpai stirred the curry rice with spoon.
I suppose it was a cover for embarrassment, but it also reminded me of my immediate enemy.
Curry rice as well as curry udon is on the plate.
<Page71>
Although the doctor has warned me not to eat too much, I'll make an exception this time so that I don't let Senpai down.
I'll have a nice bowl of curry and rice before I fill my stomach.
<Page72>
Meanwhile, Senpai and Arihiko were talking about their houses.
I knew that Arihiko didn't have any parents, but I also heard that he lived alone.
<Page73>
I heard that Senpai's apartment is rather close to the Souya Station.
It seems that she's renting an apartment in the residential area to the east, coming out from the south exit where the office district is, instead of the north exit where the downtown area is.
<Page74>
"Oh, yeah.
By the way, where do you live, Tohno-kun?"
"Yes?"
As I was eating curry rice in peace, Senpai suddenly asked me a question.
<Page75>
"If you're asking where, well, it's hard to answer......."
After all, I'm changing my residence today.
I don't feel comfortable explaining the situation. If possible, I'd like to keep it a secret and cover it up.
<Page76>
...... I can't even tell a good lie if someone is staring straight at me like this.
<Page77>
"......I'll answer that with a question.
Why do you want to know where I live?"
<Page78>
"What? Tohno-kun, you asked me where my apartment was, didn't you? I think it's unfair that I'm the only one who doesn't know where you live.#........ Um, is that weird?"
<Page79>
"Well, a little weird.
that's a strange thing to worry about, isn't it, senpai?"
<Page80>
"Mm. It's not strange.
If I don't know where you live, I won't be able to visit you if something happens to you."
<Page81>
My mouth stops eating the curry rice.
I felt as if someone had just said something that made me happy.
<Page82>
"......Visit me, for example, if I catch a cold, will you come visit me?"
No, I won't
At the moment, I have no intention of doing so."
<Page83>
"..............."
I guess I was thinking too much.
Senpai had no such intentions.
I see. In other words, she's a natural.
<Page84>
"My house is in this city, too. It takes less than 30 minutes to walk.
If you go up to the suburbs from the north exit, you'll see a residential area at the top of a hill. It's at the end of that hill."
<Page85>
"Oh, that's right. You're moving in today, right?"
Arihiko makes a deliberate comment.
Senpai tilted her head faintly.
<Page86>
"Moving in? Tohno-kun, are you a transfer student?"
"What?"
Senpai started saying something strange.
I looked at Arihiko silently.
<Page87>
"You know what? I've been in this school since the first year, and I've known you since then.
Why does the word 'transfer student' come up in your mind?"
"Because I heard you're moving..."
<Page88>
"Moving doesn't make anyone a new student. I've just changed my address, not my school.
I've been living with my relatives, but from today I'm just going back to my home."
<Page89>
Senpai, who was surprised in an unclear way, seemed to be convinced.
<Page90>
"So you just changed your house.
And now you've moved to a residential area in the suburbs."
"Yea. There's an oversized house at the top of the hill."
<Page91>
"I see, that makes sense. Are you talking about the Tohno mansion?"
<Page92>
Senpai asked hesitantly.
From the city people's point of view, the western-style building on the hill must be seen as something special.
I haven't been back for seven years, but the Tohno mansion in my memory is as big as a castle to me.
<Page93>
"That's what I meant. I know it's out of place even for me, but I can't help it now that I've moved."
<Page94>
"Hmm. I guess you aren't too enthusiastic about it.
It can't be helped if you haven't been in your own house for 7 years. It'll feel like a stranger's house for a while, won't it?"
"I wonder. I haven't dropped by yet, so I don't really know how it feels.
Well, if push comes to shove I can always take shelter at your house."
<Page95>
"What's that? Don't be silly, my house isn't your bivouac spot. Thanks to you, my sister has become more partial to you than me, and her allowance is decreasing every year!"
<Page96>
I think it's because of his bad behavior, but I don't want to talk about it because it would complicate things.
To be honest, I don't feel comfortable talking about the Tohno family.
<Page97>
"Huh. You two are really close, aren't you?"
"Well, not really. Me and Tohno may take each other's place, but we'll never go hand in hand, we're enemies, mademoiselle."
<Page98>
"But Tohno-kun even stays at your house, doesn't he? That's really close."
<Page99>
That’s not it, senpai. He ran away just because he didn’t want to stay home during summer break. The bastard feels reserved towards the Arima family whom he was entrusted to."
<Page100>
"So, he comes to me when I have a room available. My sister likes him because he's good-looking, and so he comes to stay with no money at all even though he is filthy rich!"
<Page101>
I can't forgive you, Arihiko said, shaking his fist.
...... I see, so that was the point. ...... I'll bring a souvenir or two next time.
<Page102>
"...... You were entrusted, Tohno-kun?"
Arihiko's jaw drops.
He smiles awkwardly at the fact that it doesn't suit him.
<Page103>
"Don't worry about it. There's nothing wrong with it."
I said as I ate the curry rice, without looking at Arihiko's face.
<Page104>
"I see. Well, that's true.
If I complained about that, I'd be in trouble."
I agree with him. I think this kind of optimism is a real beauty of his.
<Page105>
"...... I'm sorry, Tohno-kun."
I mean, did you not get along with your previous family...?"
<Page106>
"No, that's not true. This guy has no problems with the Arima family. They're all super nice people. Ah, the father is a little scary though.
And yet he doesn't accept their kindness, and runs away to my place whenever there's a vacation. What's wrong with you?"
<Page107>
"I'm not refusing their kindness. They've been good to me, I just don't want to burden them anymore."
<Page108>
I finished my curry rice.
All that is left now is a bowl of curry udon.
Senpai apparently is not in good spirits.
<Page109>
"I'm sorry, Senpai. That was a boring story.
"No, that's not true. I'm sorry for asking you such a strange question."
<Page110>
Senpai was trying to act cheerful, forcibly.
This topic might have been fine for a long time friend like Arihiko but for someone like Senpai such a complex topic would've been bothersome at best.
In fact, she seems to be uncomfortable and fidgety.
<Page111>
"Oh, I'm sorry, Senpai. I've got to talk to Tohno about something in private.
<Page112>
Suddenly, Arihiko made an outrageous comment.
It is as if he was saying that Senpai is in the way.
<Page113>
"What are you talking about? You can talk in private anywhere, and she hasn't finished eating ye...."
-------t.
Even though we've been talking most of the time, Senpai had already finished her curry rice.
<Page114>
"No, no, I understand. Now, if you'll excuse me. I'll leave you to it."
Senpai gives a bow and leaves.
It's just me and Arihiko at the table.
<Page115>
"......Senpai seemed uncomfortable so it was probably for the best.... But that was a close call, wasn't it? Your favorability has dropped."
<Page116>
"Hmm, well, that was unavoidable. I'm the one who slipped up, so I should at least be disliked."
Arihiko slurps his Udon.
He was so absorbed in the conversation with Senpai that it got cold.
<Page117>
"You were after Senpai right?"
"It's not just me, everyone's after her. Ciel-senpai is the best at our school.# But well, it's not like she's type to care about her popularity. Oh yeah I really do have something to talk to you about in private."
<Page118>
".........?"
Arihiko's voice was rather serious.
I break my chopsticks and start eating my curry udon.
<Page119>
"What the hell? You're creepy, acting all serious all of a sudden. Did you do something wrong again?"
"It's not that, damn it. What I want to know is this: what's really going on with you, Tohno?"
"What do you mean?"
<Page120>
"You've been at the Arima's house since primary school, right? I don't know the reason why, but it's been seven years. Your father disowned you, so why is the Tohno family now calling for your return?"
<Page121>
"He didn't actually "disown" me.
He just asked me to leave the mansion for some reason."
<Page122>
"Tohno-kun, if there ever was a family that asked their kid to "leave" the house it wouldn't be a tragedy, it'd be comedy.
It'd be a joke but too boring to be funny."
<Page123>
To tell the truth, I had a bad relationship with my father even before I was involved in the traffic accident.
The Tohno family had been a prominent family for a long time, and their way of being was far from the norm.
What I remember from my childhood is a huge Western-style building and the pressure of the family's precepts, which were locked in time to match it.
<Page124>
The Tohno family was also a wealthy family and shareholders of several companies. My father, Makihisa Tohno, was apparently a mediocre businessman, but the assets he inherited from his grandfather were strong enough to keep the company running smoothly.
<Page125>
An anachronistic building.
The life of the upper class, where civility and history are respected.
Such a life in the mansion seemed boring to my childish mind.
That's why, when I was told that I would be sent to the Arimas, I accepted without much resistance.
<Page126>
I think the results were very good.
I was able to get along well with the Arimas, and I treated Keiko and Fumiomi, my stepmother and stepfather, as if they were my real parents.
I had always longed for a normal family, and I lived with the Arimas as if I were their real son.
<Page127>
I don't think I have any regrets there.
The only thing I regret is leaving behind my little sister, Akiha.
<Page128>
Akiha... probably wants nothing to do with me.
Or rather, she has every right to hate me.
She was left alone in that huge house, living with our hard-headed father.
It is easy to imagine how Akiha feels about the brother who ran away from her.
<Page129>
"I guess you're right. It's true that if you're kicked out of the house for some reason, you can't help but laugh."
"Right? On top of that, you've never even been back. In this world, that's called being disowned.
I never asked before. But why did they disown you?"
<Page130>
"..............."
............... Well.
That's what I'd like to know as well.
<Page131>
"Well, if you don't want to talk about it, fine."
Arihiko held the bowl with both hands and drank the soup.
The remaing time was short. I decided to follow Arihiko's example and eat my lunch as quickly as possible.

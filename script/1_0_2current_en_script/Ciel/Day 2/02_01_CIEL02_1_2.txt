I'll just take it easy and buy some bread.
My financial situation from now on is going to be tough.
The head of our family is not a playful person, so there isn't any hope for extra income.
<Page2>
Therefore, I want to keep my expenses as low as possible. It would be too pathetic to be broke in a case of emergency.
<Page3>
I go to the school store and buy some affordable bread and tea.
It is more crowded than usual because of the new products they brought in, so it took a while. The bento group have already finished their lunch and are chatting.
<Page4>
"Tohno-kun, are you going to have lunch now?"
"Yeah, there's no one making noise, so I can take it easy, what about you, Yumizuka-san?
<Page5>
"I've already finished.
And so, I've got some leftover side dishes.......do you want some side dish for lunch?"
<Page6>
"------"
I observe a group of girls to make sure they don't notice me.
A few of them are gathering around and discussing the situation between me and Yumizuka.
......Whatever the reason, it is clear that Yumizuka will be teased by the girls if I refuse.
<Page7>
"I would appreciate it. Bread alone is tasteless, thank you for the meal."
I clasp my hands together and thank Yumizuka.
<Page8>
"Y-yes, indeed, it feels lonely with only bread, right?
Here you go! Fried tofu and clams in tsukudani!"
<Page9>
It's a strange combination.
The fried tofu is made by her mother, but the tsukudani is apparently made by Yumizuka. To her credit, I'll say that the taste is average.
Anyway, I think it made for a spectacular lunch.
<Page10>
"Thanks for the food, it was delicious.
If the opportunity arises, I will return the favor next time."
"N-no, it's okay, today was just a coincidence!
A-anyways.......oh yeah! Have you heard about Toyama-sensei?"
<Page11>
"About Toyama-sensei, you mean the one from yesterday?
I've heard rumors that something awful happened."
<Page12>
"Yeah! You know, I heard that was a mistake!
I heard he was involved in a car accident and broke his leg, so he had to be hospitalized."
<Page13>
"Well, that's good. Ah, no, that's not good.
If you're hospitalized because of a leg injury, it means you can't walk, right? Toyama-sensei's going to be pissed at me for messing with him."
<Page14>
"Ah.......
Y-you're right, I don't know what I'm so happy about.......
I'm sorry, I didn't think it through......."
<Page15>
Yumizuka's smile changes to a look of remorse.
But I understand how she feels.
Even if it was just a rumor, they said that he died. She can't help but feel relieved when she found out it was just a leg injury.
<Page16>
"Don't worry about it, I feel the same way you do.
Then again, we won't have a homeroom teacher for a while. It's going to be lonely without him."
"Yeah, I hope he recovers soon and returns."
<Page17>
I get caught up in Yumizuka's smile and my mouth loosens up a bit.
She isn't incredibly beautiful or anything, but she has a charm that makes everyone around her feel at ease.
<Page18>
Or rather, her good nature has made her a trustworthy "advisor" in the class.
<Page19>
She's a laid-back person, but she's popular.
She was nominated as a class committee member with the tacit consent of the class, while humbly saying, "I couldn't do it myself, and she has been able to do so until now due to her own virtues.......or rather, it's because of her good character.
<Page20>
".................."
I find myself with only two minutes left until the end of lunch break.
I've heard some good news, and without that noisy Arihiko around, I think I can spend the afternoon in peace.
".................."
By the way.
Why isn't she going back to her desk?
<Page21>
"Yumizuka-san, it's almost fifth period."
"Hyah!? Ah, yeah, I know, one minute, one minute until the bell rings!"
<Page22>
"Ah. Everyone will probably go back to their seats after the bell rings, so there's still time."
"N-no, I don't know, I don't have much time, but I think now is the time to take my chances when Inui-kun isn't here, um, well!"
"?"
<Page23>
Everyone begins to take their seats before the bell. And then...
<Page24>
"Well, you know!
Here, I have some left over, maybe you can use it!?"
<Page25>
Yumizuka holds out what looks like a card. This is a......family restaurant's loyalty card......?
<Page26>
"T-thanks, but are you sure?"
"I-I've got a lot of points!
No, my friend was in a pinch, so I applied for a part-time job and the manager gave me a bunch of cards! Come eat with us when you feel like it! At 7 pm or something like that!"
Yumizuka runs to her seat as if she's rolling.
<Page27>
The bell rings.
"..................."
I'm really happy, but I can't be honest about it.
That's because yesterday at lunch, Arihiko asked me about something like that.
<Page28>
We had just finished talking about the Tohno family and were about to finish our lunch.
"By the way, about Yumizuka...
Hey, do you have feelings for her, or do you want to go out with her?"
I didn't even ask for this kind of life advice.
<Page29>
".............Why are you telling me this now?"
"Well, you approached me this morning, didn't you? I was just curious. Yumizuka is the idol of the class. If there is any chance that you have a thing for her, I'd like to stop you."
"What? What the hell is that?? It's none of your business what I think of Yumizuka."
<Page30>
"Of course not. I just don't want to see a situation where both of us are unhappy.
She looks like that, but she's more like......
Oh well. It's certainly not for me to interfere with.
So, what do you think? Are you going to go out with her? If she's made so many moves, you'd think she'd be your girlfriend right away, right?"
<Page31>
"......I think that would be difficult."
"Huh, she isn't your type?"
"That's not what I meant. I'm warning you, Yumizuka-san is my type. I'll do my best to stop you if you try to take her."
<Page32>
"Are you her dad? Then, why are you keeping your distance?"
"No, that's......how do I say this, looking at her makes me sad for some reason."
"---That's awful."
"You want to stay as "just friends", even if she approaches you?"
<Page33>
"......I can't stop thinking about my own selfish thoughts."
But there is nothing I can do about it.
<Page34>
"Subconsciously, I tend to avoid... people who have decent values... and whom I can respect.
It's not that I don't like them, it's more like I'm afraid to approach them."
<Page35>
"............Mmm."
I have a card that has exactly 1,000 yen worth of points saved up on it.
The name of the restaurant is Lindberg. It is a very typical family restaurant located at the north exit of Souya Station.

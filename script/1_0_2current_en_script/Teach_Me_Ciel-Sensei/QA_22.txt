Good evening. This is "Teach Me, Ciel Sensei".
I am the substitute, Eco-Arc.
<Page2>
I was not originally meant to appear in this ending,
but it seems that both Ciel-sensei and Neco-Arc were blown away.
<Page3>
This time it is also an instant death from two choices,
so please return to the previous choice.
<Page4>
I want that phenomenon to end as soon as possible,
so please skip this section and go back to the main story.
<Page5>
.....
<Page6>
.....
<Page7>
You're not going to skip, are you?
I guess it can't be helped.
<Page8>
This is the final corner after all.
I suppose I can provide a little service.
<Page9>
This is a "Luminous Body"... a form of Arcueid
that appeared in this city and went out of control.
<Page10>
A "Luminous Body" is supposed to be a planetary initialization
system, but now we can not call it that anymore.
<Page11>
After getting rejected and becoming beserk, it has simply
become a love obsessed monster. You got to be kidding me.
<Page12>
...Please forget that last part. My words got mixed up.
<Page13>
In terms of it's length,
the generated system spans 200 meters.
<Page14>
Because the period of manifestation was unstable, it
continues to grow indefinitely instead of covering a large area.
<Page15>
That is the reason why it is expanding through the
buildings as well.
<Page16>
When stabilized, the total length is fixed at 100 meters.
This is to match the level of civilization around us.
<Page17>
It is impossible... to measure it's volume and weight.
<Page18>
In this case, there is mass that exists, but it is related to
the "Luminous Body" that has become one with the Earth's life force.
<Page19>
If I had to guess, I would say that it's weight is equal to
the mass of the Earth. So no matter what action you take,
"It is nothing compared to the weight of Earth,
so the weight of the damage will not reach."
<Page20>
or something similar. The ground will not collapse.
However, this does not apply to man-made objects.
<Page21>
Incidentally, the Millennium Castle dissipated
because her Marble Phantasm rank was reduced as a result.
<Page22>
The True Ancestor in the "Luminous Body" state can
only produce a rough version of a Marble Phantasm.
<Page23>
The larger the output, the harder it is to
meticulously construct a phantasm accurately.
<Page24>
The things Arcueid can do in her "Luminous Body" state
include the use of her Ultra-wide Mystic Eyes,
<Page25>
cancelling attacks directed at her with Imaginary Nullification,
manipulate geothermal heat, the atmosphere, and so on.
<Page26>
In short, it has become a threat to nature. She used to be
<Page27>
a woman that decided her actions
"consciously and meticulously".
<Page28>
But the woman you see now can only act
"unconsciously and reactively".
<Page29>
As for which one is better for humanity,
you can decide that based on your own preference.
<Page30>
...Although.
<Page31>
The figure shown in this bad end
is not the "Luminous Body" I know.
<Page32>
It is showing signs of acting as a system,
but it is also prioritizing itself and it's emotions first.
<Page33>
On top of that, it is transforming into a new "vessel"
without self-destructing from going berserk.
<Page34>
Even I do not know what impossibilities can occur
once that system has transformed into an 'individual'.
<Page35>
Dead End. Bad End.
I have seen many different kinds of ends...
<Page36>
But this can only be called a World End.
In a way, it's probably the worst possible end.
<Page37>
So it is pointless to worry about her.
Using all your strength, and without mercy,...
<Page38>
I expect you to fight back against her,
destroying every unimaginable dream into pieces.
<Page39>
So farewell.
Perhaps I'll see you again in another unimaginable dream.

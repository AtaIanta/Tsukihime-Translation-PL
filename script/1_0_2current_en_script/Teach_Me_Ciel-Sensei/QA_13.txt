Gooood evening, everyone!
<Page2>
Welcome to the ever so popular corner in which we cheer on
Tohno-kun as he tries his best despite his never-ending troubles,
<Page3>
"Teach Me! Ciel-Sensei!"
The much anticipated part two is about to begin!
<Page4>
The second half of Tsukihime is finally here.
No, this is where Tsukihime truly begins!
<Page5>
I can promise you that the level of excitement and satisfaction
will be double, no, triple that of Arcueid's route!
<Page6>
Wake Up!
Let's Coma Ciel!
<Page7>
Guwah!?
<Page8>
Mmm~~~, critical hit.
I'm disappointed that you couldn't dodge such a surprise attack.
<Page9>
Did you really think that your time to shine has come?
You're getting waay ahead of yourself, teacher.
<Page10>
It's times where you think "I got this!" that you become weak nya.
It's as if you've tied your own arms and legs.
<Page11>
I'm sure you've all felt this exact
phenomenon happen from your own eyes.
<Page12>
Just like the time when I approached General Vlov
without any winter protection and so forth.
<Page13>
That enemy is a rampant character constantly firing off mad blows.
Take one big hit and you're gone in no time!
<Page14>
You gotta fight on a whim just like a cat!
Take that, you little shit!
<Page15>
Kuh... you've really done it now, you feline creature...
But you're right, I did let my guard down.
<Page16>
This is a new route with a new heroine
from here on out, so I have to brace myself.
<Page17>
She got up within the count of ten
after taking a hit from my special move...
<Page18>
Nowadays, even a 100 yen box of candy
can be crushed in a single blow...
<Page19>
Now then. I'd like to ignore this little cat's
nonsense and get down to business.
<Page20>
The cause this time was due to your overconfidence in your abilities.
<Page21>
Tohno-kun is just an ordinary boy, so no matter
how well you are doing, you must not be in danger for too long.
<Page22>
It's times where you think "I got this"
that you must observe your own condition.
<Page23>
I said that.
I just said that exact same thing.
<Page24>
....
<Page25>
To put it short, think of it as if
Vlov is spreading around an invisible poison.
<Page26>
Of course flames, as well as low temperatures, are are threat to the human body.
So you should always be weaving in and out...
<Page27>
I said that.
I also said that earlier.
<Page28>
I'm floating.
Why is my body floating in the air?
<Page29>
That's right, just like this.
If you ever take a hit, blast away and make some distance!
<Page30>
Guwaaaaaah!?
I wouldn't have had trouble if I could do that!!!!

The one who avoided death
faced an end far worse than death itself...
<Page2>
This is the Q&A corner where we send a word to our very own Tohno-kun.
It's time for "Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!".
<Page3>
Holy crap!
This ex-sister is out of this world!
<Page4>
The explosive power of the sub-heroine's overflowing gauge
of suppressed emotions was really something to behold.
<Page5>
The way she submitted him was quite nyagnificient.
It was like watching a professional.
<Page6>
That was gruesome. Completely brutal.
With that, do you have any thoughts Ciel?
<Page7>
Why are you asking me for my opinion?
<Page8>
Ehh, the cause of death this time...
must be from the previous choice.
<Page9>
The thought of 'fighting' was definitely correct,
but the situation was absolutely terrible.
<Page10>
Even as a Dead Apostle, Noel was a coward that
avoided going for the opponent's weakest point.
<Page11>
However, seeing the turned on Tohno-kun and his
apparent inhumanity made Noel finally cross line.
<Page12>
"If he's going to go that crazy,
why don't I do something crazy too?"
<Page13>
As a result, the Dead Apostle Noel
played her trump card against Tohno Shiki.
<Page14>
I see what you mean. It's like, if a rival shop (burger chain)
is offering a 9% discount, we have no choice but to offer a 9% discount too.
<Page15>
Well, not unless we completely anyahilate them first!
Nyahahahahahaha!
<Page16>
...And so, it was Noel's brilliant tactic that
lead to the end of Glasses-kun.
<Page17>
Do you have any comment on the unladylike,
devlish act that followed, Ciel-kun?
<Page18>
According to the document here...
<Page19>
"He's used to killing and getting killed".
"My way of doing things was copied from him".
<Page20>
The assailant in this case, Miss Noel,
seems to have stated as much, has she not?
<Page21>
......
<Page22>
......
<Page23>
With that, let's wrap up the lesson for today!
<Page24>
As usual, it was another clean and open episode of
"Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!".
<Page25>
This guy just smiled all the way to the end!!

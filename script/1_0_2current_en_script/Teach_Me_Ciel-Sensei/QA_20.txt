Yo, I'm back.
I bought a bunch of stuff so let's have lunch Ciel.
<Page2>
Did you know that eating vegetables can make your stomach feel better?
Oh, you already knew? I see.
<Page3>
He who controls his fiber intake controls the food chain.
<Page4>
Behold, this salad that's overflowing with lettuce
that's three days past its expiration date...
<Page5>
The black spots accentuate throughout it's entire surface,
which could be considered nyather stylish...
<Page6>
Yes, they may be leftovers,
but that's how it goes in the wild, does it not?
<Page7>
...Hmm?
Usually she would have responded by now.
<Page8>
I would have expected her to give some bitter remark like
"Onions would have tasted better than lettuce" and such...
<Page9>
You there, who the hell are you!?
You're too kind! There's no way you could be Ciel nya!
<Page10>
Nyaa. Good evening.
This is Ciel's substitute.
<Page11>
Oh, it's just Eco.
I thought you were a stray cat.
<Page12>
Hmm? Wait, if you're here, then
that means this bad end is one of those, nya?
<Page13>
Correct. Depending on the player's perspective,
this could either be a sad or happy ending. A merry bad end.
<Page14>
I see. So Ciel must be feeling down and depressed
from the weight of her responsibility.
<Page15>
But as for me, I quite like this kind of ending.
It has that feeling of "I'm glad it ended like this".
<Page16>
...You have a point. From a big picture perspective,
there would be no more other victims after this.
<Page17>
A virtuous ending... it would be wrong to say
that there was a correct answer here.
<Page18>
If Mario were to hear about this, he would be snickering right now.
<Page19>
In any case, the solution here is to simply
go back to the previous choice and choose differently.
<Page20>
It should be easy to take down the boss,
but you will have to read the air and be patent nya.
<Page21>
That being said,
there is something that's been bothering me.
<Page22>
After choosing not to cut off her head,
doesn't Noel's reaction change depending on the play nya?
<Page23>
If you reach a high level of intimacy with Noel,
her reaction will be slightly different.
<Page24>
There are only two passages of dialogue that get affected,
so it is not a big enough difference to worry about.
<Page25>
Really? Then I'll be nicer to Noel from now on.
By the way, are there any other parts that get affected similarly?
<Page26>
....There is one other.
<Page27>
There seems to be a slight change in the final phase of this
route when Arcueid's intimacy is at it's maximum value.
<Page28>
It's about 2 seconds of dialogue in two passages, ^so you don't need to be particularly aware of it. @k
<Page29>
...As for me, I don't want you to hear about
it because it is beyond shameful.
<Page30>
Huuh. "Beyond shameful", you say?
"I love curry!", or something like that?
<Page31>
Not only was that beyond shameful, but it
was a statement that would threaten your very existence.

Huh? Hey, there's someone here Ciel.
There hasn't been any dead end or bad end either.
<Page2>
Oh my!
It's outstanding that you've made it this far!
<Page3>
Congratulations on fully completing
"Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!".
<Page4>
This is an extra bit that has nothing to do with the main story.
<Page5>
Only players who have seen all the endings
can wander into the brief world of the "future".
<Page6>
If you've read the original work, you know what I'm talking about.
<Page7>
The story of Arcueid Brunestud and
the story of Ciel have come to an end.
<Page8>
However, the story of Tohno Shiki still
leaves several unanswered questions.
<Page9>
This game was focused on the developments from "Those who came
from the outside". An action romance story.
<Page10>
What comes next is a feud with "Those who dwell within"...
which seems to be a mystery romance story about the "past".
<Page11>
...The truth behind the Tohno mansion.
...A completely different vampire case.
<Page12>
...A memory of collapse and death.
...A memory of summer, a certain view of a window.
<Page13>
The night is far from over.
And now, here is a glimpse of what's to come.
<Page14>
Now... as short as it may be,
please enjoy the trailer of the next game.
<Page15>
Ah... immoral...
How overly immoral...!
<Page16>
Japanese Western-style homes have quite a rich flavor nya.
<Page17>
Western-style homes in Europe feel natural in that area,
but Western-style homes in Japan feel somewhat out of place, right?
<Page18>
That is why Western-style homes in Japan are a world apart
from this mundane world. Or that's what I think.
<Page19>
What do you think? Ain't that cool?
Well, not as cool as my kingdom (cat village) though.
<Page20>
That's right. I agree with you in the sense that it is a
world governed by a different time and rules than the city.
<Page21>
With the stage being moved to the Tohno mansion, the
story of "Tsukihime" will take an entirely different turn.
<Page22>
However, there will be some things that won't change.
That is, of course...
<Page23>
If you're not careful, instant death.
Even from inside the mansion, you can still experience a bitter end!
<Page24>
Mmm, that's what it's all about. Right, teacher?
That our classroom, too, has not shown it's full potential.
<Page25>
Right. Our content is low-budget as usual,
but I hope you will give us a break.
<Page26>
I get it. I totally get it.
A cat's healing is the root of all tragedy.
<Page27>
Then let's go and work hard again next time, yeah!
Until then, goodbye!
<Page28>
I'll be back for sure!
Until then, stay healthy!
<Page29>
Jeez, that thing is a bottomless pit of positivity.
Maybe we could learn from her.
<Page30>
And now, I'd like to share some gratitude.
<Page31>
To you who played the game all the way to the end.
To you who waited for this game all the way until now.
<Page32>
With that, we have truly reached
the end of "Tsukihime" in it's entirety.

Good evening.
We've had yet another very rare bad end, haven't we?
<Page2>
"Huh? How did I get a bad end
when I didn't even make any choices?",
<Page3>
said Tohno-kun tilting his head as we head into the Q&A corner,
"Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!" where we rescue Tohno-kun.
<Page4>
....
....
<Page5>
The cause this time happened precisely on the 9th day.
<Page6>
This is a case of a choice that seemed to not have any
effect on the story turn out to be a deadly poison.
<Page7>
Be very careful when getting vaccinated.
<Page8>
You shouldn't be taking a dangerous injection
just because it looks fun and interesting, okay?
<Page9>
....
....
<Page10>
...Uhh.
You've been kind of quiet for a while. What are you doing?
<Page11>
Mmm, I'm filling out a questionnaire.
Reporting a glitch.
<Page12>
See, it's been two whole days since
the heroine disappeared from the main story, right?
<Page13>
If the situation continues like this, it will affect
Glasses-kun's motivation. I need to get this patched quick.
<Page14>
"Please fix the route during day 9's fight between
Ciel and Arc so that me and Tohno take down Ciel together".
<Page15>
Hahaha. There's no need to worry about that.
This heroine is always present after all.
<Page16>
However, the choices you make on the 8th night are certainly important.
It is not an exaggeration to say that this is a turning point of destiny.
<Page17>
As much as I hate to admit it,
it is true that Arcueid protected the city.
<Page18>
If you really believe from the bottom of your heart,
(not that it's true or anything),
<Page19>
that Arcueid is to be trusted,
then making a different choice from her's is the right thing to do.
<Page20>
However, I can not guarantee what will happen
to the city as a result.
<Page21>
That's all I have to say about this.
With that, you have been warned.
<Page22>
Seriously? Let's go back to day 8!
While we're at it, let's go with that choice (Arcueid)!
<Page23>
――Several hours later――
<Page24>
See, I warned you didn't I?
<Page25>
Who told   you to   take it   this far?

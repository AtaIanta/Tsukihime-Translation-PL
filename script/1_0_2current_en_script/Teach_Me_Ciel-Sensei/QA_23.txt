The one who's lost her life, called out to another lost life to return,
and thus her long night of redemption came to a dawn.
<Page2>
Nyas if.
Congrats on clearing Ciel's Normal Ending.
<Page3>
As sad as it is, this is the final episode of
"Teach Me, Ciel Sensei!".
<Page4>
After all, the main instructor isn't here anymore.
What can ya do?
<Page5>
No matter how much you wait, rainbows don't appear at night.
Well actually, you can see them on rare occasions.
<Page6>
Sunlight contains light with different
wavelengths such as blue and red.
<Page7>
But when it is passed through a prism, it appears to be
dispersed due to differences in the refractive index.
<Page8>
That's why the rainbow has seven colors nya.
The water droplets in the air act as prisms nya.
<Page9>
This phenomenon can happen not only with sunlight,
but with moonlight as well.
<Page10>
They call it a 'moonbow'.
You might have a chance to see it at an observatory.
<Page11>
I suppose you wouldn't be able to
see it back in Ciel's hometown.
<Page12>
....
<Page13>
....It ain't the same when you're talking alone.
I guess we should end it here.
<Page14>
Well, I could continue as a solo artist,
but there's no fun in that.
<Page15>
What? You don't understand?
You want an ending where everyone is happy?
<Page16>
Nyeh. Nyeh heh heh.
Nyeh heh heh heh heh heh!
<Page17>
Good Cat!
In that case, allow me to help you navigate!
<Page18>
You want to a see a different ending with a development
that'll make you go, "Huh? What's going on here?" right?
<Page19>
Then hurry up and return to day 14 and choose your fate!
<Page20>
Hey, remember the part where Glasses-kun was
forced to make the ultimate choice by the blonde beauty?
<Page21>
It would be better to make a different choice there.
<Page22>
Also, if you're only able to pick one choice there,
that's a sign that you don't have enough Arcueid points.
<Page23>
There are a couple of details but...
<Page24>
・On the night of the 8th day, speak your mind honestly.
・On the night of the 9th day, make an amusing choice.
<Page25>
It wouldn't be a stretch to say that making
these two choices will be OK.
<Page26>
From that point, a new and unexplored route awaits.
If you haven't slept well up to that point, go to sleep.
<Page27>
With that, farewell, you greedy boys and girls!
<Page28>
As long as you're trying to change fate, it's
inevitable that you'll have to fight a hell of a battle.
<Page29>
But if you somehow survive,
you, me and Ciel will see each other again in this corner!
<Page30>
That's a promise nya!

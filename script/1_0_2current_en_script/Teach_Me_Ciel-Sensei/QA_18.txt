Good evening.
Do you have a sufficient amount of hemoglobin?
<Page2>
The corner where we cleanse your palate after you proclaim,
"So this is how it ends" with your last breath.
<Page3>
It's time for "Teach Me! Ciel-Sensei!".
I am your commentator, Eco-Arc.
<Page4>
And I am the flower blooming from a corner,
otherwise known as Neco-Arc.
<Page5>
By the way, where did Ciel go nya?
And who the heck are you?
<Page6>
It seems we are the same type... which means
that you must be a young lady with a good background.
<Page7>
I mean, species of the same type
should be able to recognize one another, right?
<Page8>
It looks like you're not able to talk to me.
This must be some kind of alternative relationship, right?
<Page9>
Is it like a world rule, or something similar?
It's best if you don't break it so casually, okay?
<Page10>
I agree. As such, that must mean
our relationship is not what you described it to be.
<Page11>
We do not have much time, so perhaps
you could begin explaining this cause of death.
<Page12>
Hmm, if I don't do something about this,
an exaton of matter will be erased from this world.
<Page13>
Just like a cosmic rice cooker, perhaps?
But this person claimed to be called "Eco-Arc".
<Page14>
Oh well, I'll just call it one of my
possibilities and move on.
<Page15>
Ehh, the cause of Glasses-kun's death this time was,
simply put, his glasses.
<Page16>
"A glasses character must never take off his glasses!",
as stated by tales as old as time.
<Page17>
As for why taking off your glasses causes death,
even I do not know the answer.
<Page18>
However there are some players that have no other
option but to "Take off their glasses".
<Page19>
Mmm, in that case, perhaps there must have been something
wrong with your behavior until nyaow?
<Page20>
It's not only vampires that are in danger,
but also Glasses-kun's state of mind that's on the line.
<Page21>
Once you stumble upon your true nature,
you'll be back to normal in no time.
<Page22>
It could be said that this is like walking on a
tightrope between "neutral-good" and "neutral-evil".
<Page23>
If you are unable to proceed, please change your behavior on the ninth day.
Make sure to restrain yourself from taking up Noel's offer.
<Page24>
If he is in a bad mental state, the events at
the Tohno residence after the 13th day will be different.
<Page25>
Because uncontrollable impulses can
lead to certain tragedies.
<Page26>
Is that so? Let me check, as I
immediately examine the flowchart.
<Page27>
...Wow, you're right.
The explanation was so detailed that my eyes turned two colors.
<Page28>
Hmm, I don't know how you know so much, but an intelligent
being like you must definitely be someone like me â˜†
<Page29>
That was "Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!".
<Page30>
Does your cold attitude have no bounds!?

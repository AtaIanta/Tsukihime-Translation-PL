The long night was over,
and the city was greeted by a brilliant dawn.
<Page2>
The vampire case of Souya has come to an end,
but the battle between him and her continues.
<Page3>
Yes. Just like the sun rising time and time again,
this story will continue to move even now.
<Page4>
What did you think of the Ciel's Route Extra Ending
of "Tsukihime"?
<Page5>
Nothing was lost, and the promise of a bright future was
fulfilled. A perfect happy end.
<Page6>
The fact that this story has reached an ending like this
brings me joy like nothing before!
<Page7>
It's gone...#It's gooooone!
My "holding a bouquet of flowers" ending is gone!
<Page8>
What the hell! In the end, the blonde beauty gets defeated
just like in the normal ending!
<Page9>
Well it can't be helped, really.
<Page10>
But since you've been active in the story for so long,
you can't complain about your appearance time, can you?
<Page11>
However, you did spend some of that time as a final boss,
so I guess some of your heroine power got reduced?
<Page12>
Shit! I shouldn't have felt sorry for you
in the normal ending...!
<Page13>
Ciel the tyrant! Ciel the foul! Ciel the Indian!
This must be the work of the Holy Church!
<Page14>
Regardless, it made for a great spectacle
and I'm sure it increased everyone's satisfaction.
<Page15>
And besides... I thought Arcueid in her luminous state
was rather cute, don't you agree?
<Page16>
It's just that what she did was troublesome,
but the principle of her actions was endearing and understandable.
<Page17>
...Really?
<Page18>
I see... Ehehe...
I suppose you're right about that...
<Page19>
She is the face of 'Tsukihime' after all...
A perfect heroine is strong no matter what she does...
<Page20>
Thank god this cat is dumb.
<Page21>
Nya nya nya, you don't have to praise me nyat much.
Heh... You can come hug me tonight... if you'd like.
<Page22>
Now allow me to greet you once again.
<Page23>
Although there may be other developments and
endings that have yet to be seen,
<Page24>
"Tsukihime - A piece of blue glass moon -"
has now reached it's grand finale.
<Page25>
Just as Tohno-kun must sadly take his leave
in the middle of this story, this Q&A corner,
<Page26>
"Teach Me! Ciel-Sensei!" must also come to an end.
This is the final installment for real.
<Page27>
Whether it is a character in the game, the story,
<Page28>
or something else, if it turns into a lasting memory,
we couldn't be any happier.
<Page29>
We thank you very much
for playing the game all the way to the end.
<Page30>
And with that,
I hope you have a great day as always!
<Page31>
Although I can't accept any of this nya!
<Page32>
Have faith that there be a True Arcueid route
where I will become the heroine once again!

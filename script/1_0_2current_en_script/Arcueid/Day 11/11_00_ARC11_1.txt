--It's morning.
I put on the glasses from my bedside table and open my eyes.
I can see the peaceful blue sky through the window.
<page2>
「.........」
Though it's such a bright, beautiful morning, my own feelings are clouded in darkness.
There's no need to ask why.
I can't get the image of Arcueid saying she was sorry out of my head.
<Page3>
"Let's forget eachother---"
What are you talking about?
Was it the assault in the alleyway?
Or maybe it was just Arcueid and everything about her.
<Page4>
...Either way, it's impossible.
I can't forget a single thing about her.
<Page5>
I stare at my unmoving hands.
My fingers still remembers Arcueid's body.
The feeling of her smooth skin.
I remember her body heat, both cool and hot.
<Page6>
My regrets are innumerable. At that time, it just seemed like a natural consequence that she would kill me.
<Page7>
That was just my own selfish thinking.
At that time, I couldn't reason with her pure thought process.
If only I could've touched her more as human being, instead of touching her like an animal. How much more I would've--
<Page8>
「Ngh..」
I grind my teeth at that selfish thinking.
It's not that I lost myself when I saw her golden eyes.
It's that at some point I started getting serious.
<Page9>
Without really knowing why, I'd becoming completely charmed by her.
I've been that way for a long time now—probably from the moment she said she'd forgive someone like me—regardless of Roa. I've been broken by her.
Though--
<Page10>
"Wouldn't it be better if we didn't keep meeting like this?"
<Page11>
I can't get that lonely smile out of my head.
It's really too late.
If I had realized sooner, I wouldn't have made her make that face.
<Page12>
The scene in the morning never changes.
Hisui has come to wake me up.
I go to the living room and Akiha and Kohaku are there.
Before I head off to school, we exchanged a quick greeting.
<Page13>
It's just like it always is.
In order to protect times like this, I had put myself in danger.
I should be satisfied. I didn't lose anything.
<Page14>
Despite that, my mood was inexplicably hollow. No matter who spoke to me, all I could do was give an empty answer. I left the peaceful mansion on autopilot like a machine performing its standard duties.
<Page15>
All of the students passing the main gate seem so cheerful.
Everyone in attendance is talking about how tomorrow is a day off.
「Huh. I guess today is friday.」
Over the past few days Arcueid has been pushing me so hard that my sense of what day it has been fading.
<Page16>
The first time I met her was a friday morning.
It was right here, exactly. She'd been waiting for me at the intersection in front of the school.
「...She was smiling, wasn't she.」
<Page17>
It was like that from the start.
Lying in wait to ambush the bloodthirsty stranger who had killed her and yet she had a playful twinkle in her eye.
<Page18>
「...What was she thinking? I just wish that I could ask that」
But my chance was gone.
Her coming to the park had already become impossible.
<Page19>
I sit in my seat#.
There's about 5 minutes before homeroom begins.
Nothing to do now but stare aimlessly into the schoolyard.
<Page20>
「Woah, gooood morning. You playing hooky all the time was pretty conspicuous. Did you decide to get serious?#」
「..........」
I let out a heavy sigh.
This is where we would normally hurl abuse at eachother, but this morning I just don't have it in me.
<Page21>
「What's up with you. You don't look so good again. You didn't come to school yesterday, and even when you do come you're like a shell. It's no fun to come to school if you're like this, man.」
Arihiko shrugs his shoulders exaggeratedly.
<Page22>
「Sorry, but can you leave me alone today. #You have Senpai so just act like I'm not even here. In fact, wouldn't it be luckier if I wasn't here?」
<Page23>
What? I don't know any third years」
「....What did you just say? You know--#」
<Page24>
After saying that, my mouth stopped.
Senpai...Who was I talking about?
I'm the same as Arihiko, I don't know any third years.
<Page25>
「Oh, homeroom is starting. #See you at lunch.」
Arihiko sneaks out through the door at the back of the classroom.
In came Noel-sensei...or not. It was the teacher from the neighboring classroom.
<Page26>
「Huh? Makuma-sensei? This is classroom 2-C you know. Are you in the right place?」
「Oh yes, I'm in the right place. Your teacher you see #quit this morning.」
The laid-back math teacher said absent-mindedly.
<Page27>
「No way! Noel-sensei isn't here anymore!?」
「You can just quit being a teacher that easily!?」
「She couldn't even last a week」
「I knew that carnivore was just another slut」
The boys from the Noel faction screamed.
I just nodded and agreed with an indifferent and distant tone.
<Page29>
That woman, Noel, was here under the pretense of teaching just to monitor me--or rather, to monitor the vampire Roa. Now, she's moved on.
She's disappeared, or maybe it's more accurate to say she has no business here anymore.
<Page30>
I've been thoroughly cut off from that world of "vampires".
The final thread connecting Tohno Shiki's world to Arcueid has been severed.

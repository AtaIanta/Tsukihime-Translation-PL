Although the forest was not paved, there was a path through the forest that could be used by people.
<Page2>
It is said that the Tohno family's site was originally this forest.
The present house and garden were just the entrance to this forest, but after the war, the head of the family at that time converted the mansion to its present form.
<Page3>
Although it wasn't that big, I was walking through a forest with no end in sight.
During my walk, I spot a strange building.
"......Was there ever a building like that?"
<Page4>
It looked like Hisui was heading for this building, but it was in the opposite direction from where she was heading.
That building might be some kind of temple in the middle of the forest.
<Page5>
―――And.
After about ten minutes of walking, I finally get a clear view.
<Page6>
"......An empty space."
In the middle of the forest, I came upon an unnaturally open square.
I have no idea what this place is.
Or at least I don't remember much about it.
It's a blind spot that can never be seen from outside the forest, when you're in the mansion... A small open space surrounded by trees that I would never have noticed if I hadn't followed Hisui.
<Page7>
" ...... I wonder if there was such a place before.
If there was, it would be a great place to play..."
At least, I don't remember playing with Akiha in the forest square.
―――I don't think so, I feel like.
<Page8>
"............"
After a few moments of thought, I stepped inside.
......There is nothing special about the open space.
There is no sign of Hisui, who was walking ahead of me.
<Page9>
"What the hell... it's just a vacant lot."
The sun is even stronger in the center of the square.
Even without looking up at the sky, my vision was blurred by the strong sunlight.
<Page10>
It was probably because I had walked through the cold forest.
I felt as if I were in a summer day.
Suddenly, I noticed that there was a big, big cloud in the sky.
The landscape was shifting slowly.
The faint sounds of cicadas.
Sounds of cicadas.
<Page11>
"――――――, ahh."
My consciousness is burning.
I kneel down on the hot sandy ground with a bang.
<Page12>
I know.
I've forgotten it, but I know it.
The melting summer sun.
The repetitive sound of cicadas.
The choking smell.
At my feet. A large reddish-black mass that had been a living thing until a moment ago.
<Page13>
"P―――ain............"
The wound in my chest hurts.
As if／i was stabbed.
Pain of being stabbed／in the chest／with knife.
<Page14>
 I killed him<. I|miiiin><killed|min min>him。
 Stop it<. Stop|miiiin><it|min min>.
 He is dead<. He|miiiiin><is|min min>dead. #――――――
――――Somewhere, there is the sound of <cicadas|people>.
Although it is already autumn now.
<Page15>
The eyes exposed to the flashing summer sun.
The lukewarm air is unpleasant.
I can feel the sound of cicadas in the sky.
At my feet are the husks of cicadas.
A husk. Someone's body.
<Page16>
"――――........."
The wound opens.
The chest is dyed red, and my hands are reddish-black.
<Page17>
...Someone's shadows cowering.
  The sound of a young girl's footsteps approaching.
  Distant clouds in the sky. Presence of cicadas.
  Before I know it.
  Akiha cries in front of me, covered in blood.
<Page18>
Miiin, min min.
Miiin, min min.
......ah.
The cicada's voice is like a needle, trying to pierce my eardrums.
<Page19>
"Ag――――h"
What is it? My chest hurts. I feel nauseous.
The wound should have been closed long ago, but why does it hurt so much?
<Page20>
My chest is broken.
The old wound opens up and red stains my chest.
―――Oh my God.
My wound hasn't healed at all.
<Page21>
     It hurts.
       It's scary.
         This is it.
            I want to die.
<Page22>
My consciousness sinks.
Wound opens.
My mind regresses, enveloped in the hallucinations of summer.
My soul slips away.
I heard the sound of my own body slumping into the grass.

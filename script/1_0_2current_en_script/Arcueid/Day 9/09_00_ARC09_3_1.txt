After thinking for a while about what to do, I decided to take my first walk in the house in seven years.
Let's go to the first floor and the courtyard.
<Page2>
I narrowed my eyes at the sunlight streaming through the skylight.
The lobby of the Tohno Residence is breathtaking at any time.
<Page3>
When I was a child, I used to get angry while exploring the mansion, #believing that this mansion was like a castle and that there must be a hidden door somewhere that led to a world I had never seen before.
<Page4>
Now that I am no longer a child, and my nagging father is gone.
All that is now in the past.
<Page5>
" ......I miss it.
I used to get nervous just walking down the hallway of the mansion."
<Page6>
The memory of walking stealthily through this lobby seven years ago came back to me.
I started to walk leisurely through the mansion as if lured by these memories.
<Page7>
I stepped out onto the terrace.
Strangely enough, the outside of the mansion was more memorable than the inside.
The Tohno residence is huge.
The mansion was more than ten times the size of a normal house, but the area around it was like an amusement park.
<Page8>
Seven years ago ...... I was only ten years old, and I can't imagine how adventurous the world must have been for me.
<Page9>
I walked around a little bit every day, carving my name into the trees and the ground. At that time, it was game which I played with Akiha.
We used to say to each other, "The place where you carve your name is your territory," and the two of us would walk around the house and carve our names.
<Page10>
Speaking of which, most of the times I played with Akiha were in this garden.
Unlike me, Akiha followed Makihisa's orders, so we could only play for about half an hour a day.
<Page11>
However, all she did was follow behind me and listen to what I said.
When it came time to play, she would run around energetically and compete with me to win or lose in whatever we did.
<Page12>
"...... I guess.
She has always had the foundation for his current personality, hasn't she?
She may have been wearing five or six cats in front of his father."
<Page13>
But then again, Akiha today has changed too much. Seven years is a lot longer than I thought it would be.
Time has passed, and we have grown up.
The two of us are no longer the same Shiki Tonho and Akiha Tonho of our childhood.
<Page14>
"Oh, there it is!#"
The gazebo in the courtyard.
Underneath a pillar, hidden from view in the shadows of the sun, there are words carved in stone.
<Page15>
I go around the gazebo and count the letters that are already blurred. SHIKI. AKIHA. SHIKI. SHIKI. SHIKI.
It seems that five battles have been fought here.
<Page16>
It's the same in other places, but in percentage terms, <my name|SHIKI> is more common.
Afterall, Akiha is a girl, and I guess she couldn't match the scope of my boy's abilities.
<Page17>
"Really. I should have at least gone easy on her."
Even though I feel sorry for my behavior as a child, the number of scribbles remains the same.
I wonder how many tears of frustration I had caused Akiha, who hates to lose.
<Page18>
"...... I see. He might be releasing this grudge right now."
I'm not sure if that's the case for Akiha, but if it is, it's very cute.
<Page19>
"Ahh. I feel like I'm the stupidest brother ever."
I look up with a bitter smile
I've enjoyed the nostalgic memories, and now it's time to go to the mansion---
"...huh?"
……
I discovered another piece of graffiti in the back of the gazebo ceiling.
<Page20>
"...... in a place like that?"
How could it be carved?
A child's height can't reach it. I don't know if even an adult can reach it.
<Page21>
"That's my name.......but."
I climbed up on the gazebo, put my feet on the railing and examined the ceiling.
……But this is a place that adults wouldn't notice unless they crawl on the ground and then stand up.
The ceiling, protected by shadows, is narrow.
<Page22>
　　　　　　　『WATCH OUT FOR BROTHER』
<Page23>
"……………?"
I don't know what that means.
Watch out for brother......?
It's not Akiha's handwriting. So I suppose I'm the one who wrote this......?
<Page24>
I thought I heard a noise and turned around.
For a moment, I saw a brown and white maid uniform through the trees.
"Hey, Hisui......?"
Hisui is unaware of me.
Wondering what she was going to do, Jade walked into the forest.
<Page25>
"Why are you going into forest......?"
From here onwards there is just a forest.
There's nothing there, so what is Hisui going to do?
"............."
Intrigued, I start following her a little.

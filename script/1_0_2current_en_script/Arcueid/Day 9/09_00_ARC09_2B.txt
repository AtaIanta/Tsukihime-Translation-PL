"...I'm sorry Please scold me.
It was my fault for not noticing your modulation."
"It's not your fault, Hisui. It happens all the time, don't exaggerate."
<Page2>
I lay down on the bed and lean my upper body against the backrest while talking to Hisui.
After that, Hisui came to check on the room and helped me out, and now I'm settled in bed.
<Page3>
"My sister will contact the school.
......Is it alright for you to be absent due to illness?"
"Yeah, that's fine. I'm just a little tired, and I'm kinda guilty of missing school."
<Page4>
"If you are so tired that you can no longer stand up, you can no longer be called tired. Shiki-sama is the eldest son of the Tohno family. You need to take better care of yourself."
<Page5>
"No, I take good care of myself."
Hisui scolded me, and I replied with a wry smile.
<Page6>
The panic of Hisui after she found me was amazing.
First, she opened the door and froze for a few seconds.
Then, she rushed over to pick me up, but froze with a hard face for about a minute.
<Page7>
She rushed around the room and paced for a few more minutes until she went to call Kohaku-san.
In the end, Hisui never touched my body, but I could clearly feel her devotion.
<Page8>
After that, I returned to bed with Kohaku-san's help and was treated to porridge as a meal for the sick, which I have been eating ever since.
<Page9>
It was fortunate that Akiha was already on her way to school.
If I had collapsed half an hour earlier, she would have been late for school too.
<Page10>
"Anyway, thank you Hisui.
I've had a good meal, and this will help with the anemia, so you can go back to work."
<Page11>
"Very well, sir.
But at least you will have a medical examination.
Dr. Arach will be here this morning, so why don't you take this opportunity to have a thorough physical examination?"
<Page12>
What a surprise. Is that strange doctor here too?
......I really don't need a checkup, but I'm not sure Jade will go unless I say yes.
For checkup I will...
C:>go with Dr. Arach.
C:>pick Kohaku-san.

".................."
......I have no choice.
If I go against Akiha one more time, I'm going to make her cry.
<Page2>
"......Okay, I'll sleep quietly today."
I lay my body down on the bed.
<Page3>
"Are you serious......?
No sneaking out of the room afterwards, okay?"
<Page4>
"No, I won't. To tell you the truth, I'm still very tired.
 I don't think I'll be able to go outside under Akiha's watchful eye."
"----Thank God."
 Akiha was relieved and her shoulders dropped.
<Page5>
"Hisui, go tell Kohaku-san that your brother is awake.
Nii-san, what would you like for dinner?"
<Page6>
"...I... No, tell Kohaku-san that I apologize, because I don't think I can eat. Please let me sleep like that tonight."
"......I understand. Hisui, go tell Kohaku that."
<Page7>
......well.
As soon as I put my body on the bed, I felt sleepy again.
At this rate, I'm sure I'll be asleep in less than a minute.
---But before that.
<Page8>
"Akiha. Was there a place like that in our yard?"
"Yes. We used to play there when we were kids."
"I see. I don't remember much about it."
......Oh. I really forgot about it.
<Page9>
"And one more thing, I have a weird question for you.
When I was a kid, there was me, Akiha and one other kid, am I correct?"
<Page10>
"?"
Akiha nodded her head, having no idea.
......That's right. There wasn't such a child.
<Page11>
But--- it would be strange if it wasn't.
The scene I saw in the dream.
And the dream I saw in that square.
If these two are the same thing, then ----
<Page12>
There must be another child in this house who has been killed to make the story fit---.
<Page13>
"No, it's nothing. It's just a story about a dream."
"I see. Well, good night, Nii-san.
Get some rest tonight."
"Yes, I will."
<Page14>
As soon as I heard Akiha's voice, my consciousness abruptly disconnected.
As I drift off to sleep, I don't feel the same emotions that I have been feeling for the past few days.
......The power of will turned off like a machine that has been switched off.
I sank into a dark abyss as I tried to escape the events of the day.

Kohaku-san is right choice after all.
I'm sure I' m suffering from anemia due to fatigue, so I'll ask her to prescribe me some nutritional supplements as well as medicine for eyestrain and vertigo.
<Page2>
However, it's not good for me to have my body examined.
I'm scraped up here and there from last night's altercation with Noel-sensei, and if I were to suffer from internal bleeding, it would be a serious matter.
"Shiki-san's savage, where did you get this injury?"
I could be seriously scolded.
<Page3>
"Oh my god, ordinary soldier Shiki-san!
Where did you get this injury, your back is so red!"
"Yes, I'm sorry. I regret it."
<Page4>
As I expected, she took off my shirt within a minute and got angry at me.
By the way, I'm always curious to know what kind of image Kohaku-san has of "ordinary soldiers" in her mind.
<Page5>
"When I was coming home, I fell down the hill on my way to school.
I landed on my back with a bang."
"Well, I'm sorry to hear that......
I will prepare a compress for you, so please stay where you are for a while. Oh, and it would be very helpful if you could measure your temperature with a thermometer."
<Page6>
Amber stands up from the side of the bed, still holding the first aid kit she brought with her.
I watch her back absentmindedly, thinking that she is so meticulous that she should have left the first aid kit there.
<Page7>
" ――― That' s too goofy.
Kohaku-san, you can leave the first aid kit. You'll be back soon."
<Page8>
"No, this one is all about calming you down, so I'm going to switch it out with one specifically for bruises.
And you know what? Shiki-san's room is tidy, so I feel bad about making a mess with the servants' personal belongings."
<Page9>
"I see. But you don't have to worry about my room. I'm not a cleaning freak.
"Is that so? Shiki-san's room is very neat and clean."
<Page10>
"I simply don't have much possessions. It happens to be that way."
<Page11>
"The luggage that arrived from Arima's house was only a change of clothes. Do you have any other personal belongings, Shiki-san?"
"Yes, the things I put in my bag are enough.
I brought all the important things with me when I came here."
<Page12>
On my first day at the mansion, I put away my personal belongings in my student bag and put them in my desk drawer.
If I ever get kicked out of the house, I can just pack what I have in the drawer and go.
<Page13>
" ......I'm sorry, vut......
When you were left at Arima's house, did Makihisa-sama took away your stuff......?"
<Page14>
"Eh? No, I've always been like that. I didn't want anything, so I didn't even ask my dad for it.
However, I don't remember what happened before and after the accident, so I don't know about that time."
<Page15>
I remember when I was alone in my hospital room.
No one showed up to visit me, and I ran out of the hospital room, terrified that I would see the lines of death.
It was because of this that I met the Sensei, and as it turned out, I could not have been luckier.
<Page16>
"By the way ......, the one time I stopped by here after the hospital is a bit of a hazy memory too.
The only thing I remember is that I was called into <Makihisa|old man>'s study."
<Page17>
At that time, I was told that I was not worthy to be the eldest son of the Tohno family and was given an insulation letter.
<Page18>
"I'm sure you were tired from your long stay in the hospital.
 You must have been bored during your convalescence, and your sense of the day must have become ambugous?"
"I think so. After all, I was in the hospital for almost half a year.
But it fell only a little more than a month, though."
<Page19>
"Fufu. That's a great thing, Shiki.
Even in a hospital, six months in a single room must be a very painful experience.
You were at an age when you just wanted to play."
<Page20>
Kohaku-san is right.
The fact that I felt that my time in the hospital was short means that the people around me treated me well.
I would like to thank the doctors who saved my life and the nurses who took good care of me.
<Page21>
"I'm sorry, I got carried away.
I'll be back soon, so please be quiet, okay? If you go out just because you don't want to be patched up, I'll certify you as an unrestrained cat☆」
<Page22>
Leaving a star-spangled smile, Kohaku-san went to get a compress.

"I-I'm home......."
I open and close the front door as quietly as I can and discreetly enter the lobby, announcing my return in a voice that was neither too loud nor too quiet.
<Page2>
The time was 8:00 pm, one minute ago.
I ran as fast as I could from the front of the station and just barely made it in time, but honestly, it was so hard that I felt like throwing up. That slope is too much of a pain in the ass.
It was fine because it was downhill on the way to school, but I forgot that it will be uphill on the way back to the mansion.
<Page3>
"Welcome back, Shiki-sama.
I know you are tired, but before you go back to your room, please come to the office. ---Akiha-sama has something to tell you."
<Page4>
"Ugh......the office, is it?"
The fact that Akiha took the trouble to call me into her office shows that she's in a bad mood.
<Page5>
"You are taking a detour because you have money to spare.
As a punishment, I will reduce your monthly entertainment expenses by about 20%."
<Page6>
And that was the punishment.
As soon as I entered the office, I was told of the decision without any room for explanation.
I mean, yeah.......from now on, I'll get my monthly allowance from Akiha.......and suddenly it's reduced......
Rejoice, Father. Akiha grew up to be a much stricter master than you.
<Page7>
"B-but that's not true, is it? I came back before curfew, remember?
......Well, I didn't make it before dark, but......"
<Page8>
"Oh, that is surprising. You were aware that you made a promise to me. Then why did you not keep it?"
"No. It's just, I forgot."
<Page9>
"Nii-san, I forgot to tell you something as well.
As an added punishment, you will not have dinner tonight."
"Wha...."
<Page10>
What a tyrant......!
This strictness is seriously frightening...... just in this much time, if I broke the curfew, what would've happened to me?
<Page11>
......I trudge across the lobby and head to my room.
After that, I protested to the head of the family, but could not undo the punishment of taking away my dinner.
On the other hand, my allowance was only cut by 10%.
Taking her brother's dignity is a great victory for her.
<Page12>
"Shiki-san, Shiki-san."
"......Kohaku-san?"
I was on my way back to my room when Kohaku comes to talk to me.
Just like this morning, she hides herself in a corner of the corridor and talks in private.
<Page13>
"Oh no. You can't do that, you have to come home properly at least for today.
I thought you listened to me the first time, but you left too early."
"? Wait, who told you that?"
<Page14>
"That's obvious.......#no, no, it's nothing.
Anyway, as a servant, I cannot overlook the fact that you did not have dinner.
So I prepared a light meal for you in your room.
It's just a simple rice ball and miso soup."
<Page15>
"......!"
What a thoughtful maid you are......!
I'm sure she'll be scolded if Akiha finds out about the phone in the morning, but I can't believe she's so considerate.......
<Page16>
"But you don't mind, do you? It'd be a huge help but......."
"Yes. It's about your health.
Besides, Hisui-chan has agreed to this. Even if Akiha-sama finds out, I'm sure she'll forgive us if we both apologize."
"I see, that girl also......"
<Page17>
She was looking out for me.
It's easy to misunderstand her because she doesn't seem to show her emotions, but it seems that Hisui also felt bad about my "no dinner" treatment.
<Page18>
"Shiki-san. It's not that girl. It's Hisui-chan."
"Oh, yeah, I know. But since I don't know her well yet, I feel bad about calling her by her name so casually."
<Page19>
"No, don't do that. It's a terrible idea.
Hisui-chan is very kind in spite of her appearance.
You can call her by her first name as if she were family."
<Page20>
Kohaku-san is staring straight at me.
......Surely, it will be difficult for her to do this if she continues to act like a stranger.
I'm sure she's just as concerned about me as I am about her, I have to be as lenient as possible.
<Page21>
"I understand. From now on, no matter what happens, I'll call her Hisui-cha.... no, saying "chan" is a bit too embarrassing so I'll just call her Hisui."
"Yes, that would be good."
<Page22>
After that, Kohaku-san goes downstairs.
I join my hands in my heart to the Nightingale of the Tohno residence, and return to my room.
Rice balls...... It must be very tasty, since it's made by Kohaku........
<Page23>
"---Well, that was nice."
I ate the rice balls specially made by Kohaku-san.
Hisui told me it was time for my bath.
When I came back from the bath, it was 9 o'clock in the evening.
<Page24>
It's a little too early to go to sleep.
I have only a reference book in my hand and nothing to read.
I'm not too tired today.
Rather than wasting time, I decide to go to---
C:>Talk to Akiha in the living room.
C:>Visit Kohaku-san's room.
C:>Rest here.

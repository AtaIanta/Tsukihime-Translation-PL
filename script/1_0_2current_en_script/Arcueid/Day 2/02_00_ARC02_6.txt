Ooooooooooooooo--------
---Like a wave, I hear the sound of something.
<Page2>
Oooooooooooo-----------
---The howl of an animal. It's fine and shrill like of a wild dog's.
<Page3>
Oooooooooooo-----------
---It echoes in my eardrums. Is it barking at the moon?
<Page4>
Oooooooooooo-----------
---A disgusting smell. The roar of this beast gives me a headache.
<Page5>
Oooooooooooo----------
---The sound does not stop.
Like a bullet shot into the skull.
It echoes harder.
<Page6>
Oooooooooooo.
Oooooooooooo.
Oooooooooooo----
<Page7>
"......Oh my god, it's so loud!"
I open my eyes, putting on my glasses.
I can still hear the dog barking outside my window.
<Page8>
The clock has just turned eleven at night.
It's more than just disturbing my sleep.
<Page9>
"Damn......what the hell is with that barking......?"
The dog's howl can be heard from outside the mansion.
......I'm not going to be able to sleep at this rate.
<Page10>
"......I guess there's no choice.
I can't call the police to tell them that some dog is being too noisy."
<Page11>
I get out of bed and change back into my school uniform.
I'm sure that Akiha and the others are having trouble sleeping as well.
I'm the only man in the mansion, so I guess I have to take care of it for them.
<Page12>
I leave the mansion.
The night has frozen over, and everything comes to a standstill.
<Page13>
The moon is hidden behind the clouds.
Even the light of street lamps appears to have congealed like paint drops on a canvas.
<Page14>
Oooooooooooo.
............Ooooooooo.............
........................oooooo..............
<Page15>
Oddly enough, the howling sounds weaker out here.
Or is the howl just starting to fade?
Either way, it doesn't matter much.
The noise is more painful to my mind and eyes than to my ears.
Just listening to it makes me feel disgusted in my heart.
<Page16>
"Shut up."
My legs feel heavy as I start walking.
The sensation around my fingertips is unsteady.
Suddenly.
I notice that my breath is white.
<Page17>
It's even quieter outside the mansion.
It feels as if everything has ceased to exist.
In this frozen world, only my shadow is alive.
<Page18>
".................."
I don't know why I'm so thirsty.
Around the mansion, high walls stretch out endlessly in the night.
Warming my numb fingers with my breath, I walk in the direction where the dogs are probably gathered.
<Page19>
"------Eh?"
My thoughts come to a halt.
In the distance, under a light, I see something.
I've never seen anything like it before (not in my whole life).
An impossible sight---
<Page20>
                                    A melting dog.
What is that?!
                                    A long blade pointed at it.
What is that?!
                                    A melted howl.
What is that?!
                                    A long blade that pierces.
What is that?!
<Page21>
A scream as if it had lost its mind.
Or like a strong wind.
After the sounds that tore at my eardrums ran through, there are no more cries of a dog, no more dogs even.
As if it has never existed in the first place.
It fades away without a trace.
<Page22>
---So, it's an illusion.
Is what I'm seeing now a hallucination or a dream?
<Page23>
---Then, is that an illusion too?
There, under the streetlight that seems to have been cut off from the darkness, stands an obscure figure.
<Page24>
Is that a coat? ......I wonder.
The figure wearing a thick coat doesn't seem to notice me standing here.
<Page25>
"------"
I'm thirsty. My whole body is sweating.
The night air sticks to my skin.
It's not like anything is wrong with me.
But everything feels heavy, like I'm at the bottom of the ocean.
<Page26>
[zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00]
I hear a distant, foreign sound.
The dizziness almost knocks me unconscious.
I put all my strength into my staggering legs and manage to stay on my feet without falling.
And then---
It is a normal, quiet road.
<Page27>
"Ha----h."
I breathe a sigh of relief, and my lungs greedily take in air.
......I didn't realize it, but I was not breathing properly since I left the main gate.
<Page28>
"..............."
I don't hear them howling anymore.
......As if overcome by a fever, I leave the illusion.
<Page29>
......I'm back in my room.
There is no sign that Akiha and the others are awake.
It seems that I was the only one who could not stand that dog's howling.
<Page30>
"-----Guh."
I wonder what that was.
My head still hurts.
<Page31>
"Huh? I wonder why I'm shaking."
My fingers are trembling.
My whole body is shaking, and my back is very cold.
Metaphorically speaking,
it's like someone ripped out my spinal cord and put a pillar of ice in its place.
<Page32>
"-----"
I feel dizzy and lightheaded.
I wonder if it's the usual anemia.
I feel like my consciousness is being thrown to the ground with my brain and all.
On the way, I see something I don't like.
<Page33>
"------"
Even though I'm wearing my glasses, I can still see those "lines".
<Page34>
"Ugh.........!"
My eyeballs can't take the nausea that's been building up.
It's a reaction to the fact that I've been trying not to see them for the last seven years.
<Page35>
My mind can't take this situation.
I feel sick. Combined with the dizziness from the anemia, I feel like I'm about to throw up the contents of my stomach at any moment.
<Page36>
"I can't believe it. What's going on here?"
I really don't know.
But as long as I keep my eyes open, I can't help but see the lines.
<Page37>
"---It's a bad dream."
I manage to fall into the bed.
......Well, then go to sleep. It's the quickest way to deny what I've seen.
<Page38>
......I can't even move my body like I want to.
For now, I'm just going to stay like this, like a corpse.
Just go to sleep like a puppet with broken strings---

It's been three minutes since the start of homeroom.
The replacement teacher for Toyama-sensei has not arrived.
<Page2>
The classroom is buzzing and order is breaking down.
To be more specific, students are all over the place.
<Page3>
Everyone in the class thinks that if we are going to be left like this, we should play until first period starts.
One more minute. Let's just hold out for one more minute.
After that, we are free to do whatever we want.
<Page4>
"Okay, everyone, let's settle down, settle down.
Homeroom is starting!"
<Page5>
The buzz in the air instantly calms down.
The teacher who walks into the classroom is a person that I had never seen before, a person I had never expected to see, a person who is not Japanese by any means, and in fact, looks like a university student.
<Page6>
"Huh? What's up with this atmosphere?
Everyone suddenly froze up......
What's that, I'm a "Basilisk" woman? #Nah, the metaphor ain't clear, is it? Erm, in proper Japanese, I'd be that "TV haunting" girl? But Sensei's name isn't Sadako, y'know."
<Page7>
Isn't that an old metaphor? I frown.
The mysterious woman, on the other hand, stands at the podium without a trace of worry, and clears her throat deliberately.
<Page8>
Nice to meet you. I'm Noel Aizome, the new substitute for Toyama-sensei, who has been transferred.
We'll only be hangin' out for one more month, but I'm lookin' forward to workin' with y'all."
<Page9>
"I'd be teaching PE and English, my favorite food's Mont Blanc, my favorite gift's cash or web money, and my not good word's pet shop.
I'm always open to questions, so feel free to attack me, okayâ™¡."
<Page10>
"------"
A faint noise echoes through the classroom.
It is a noise from the desk of a boy who was about to get up from his chair when Noel winked at him.
I have to admit that I am taken aback as well.
<Page11>
Noel-sensei is not a strikingly beautiful woman.
She's not a spectacularly beautiful, but she's within my reach.
Although she's a little bit older than me, 
it's like she's filled with a charm that can't be put into words.
Anyway, that was something like a fluffy whip that stimulated the yearnings of high school boys at first sight.
<Page12>
"I have a question! How old are you, Noel-sensei?"
"More importantly, where do you live?"
"I want to know how you spend your holidays and what your hobbies are!"
"Or rather, what is your favorite type of high school student?"
<Page13>
Immediately, a storm of questions erupts from the boys.
These topics are usually discussed in an anonymous forum, but the guys who were hit by her wink couldn't even wait for that.
<Page14>
The girls look at them coldly as if saying, "Boys are pathetic," but it seems that the scorn of classmates who they are tired of looking at, are not important to them, as they are in the heat of the moment.
<Page15>
"Reacting like a flying fish, thank you!
Eeh, the girls would probably figure out my age anyway so let's just say I'm 25 years old, I live in a rented apartment two stations away, my favorite type of men are the mature intellectual type. My hobby's helpin' out at the church on Sundays. There's a church in the next town over, so if you're interested, Sensei's happy if you'd come over and pray."
<Page16>
"Church? What are you, a Sister? I mean, are you a Sister as a hobby?"
"Yep. It's not that uncommon in my country. Well, I'm still a volunteer though, just tryin' to resolve confessions of the troubled lambs, y'know."
<Page17>
"Oh......oooh......."
The boys are stunned by Noel's unexpectedly good response.
I, too, am a bit taken aback by the novelty of the word "Sister".
<Page18>
Meanwhile, a group of girls are silently fiddling with their phones.
I casually check the anonymous bulletin board for students.
<Page19>
"What's with that, boys are too stupid..."
"Is she that beautiful?"
"I wonder if she's half French or something"
"I mean, isn't that woman a little too blatant?"
<Page20>
......There you have it.
There is a lot of negative talk on the board.
<Page21>
Thus, the class has become a mysterious space divided into simple factions of "boys" and "girls".
In other words, this is the primitive age of middle school students cursing each other, saying "boys are terrible" and "girls are annoying".
<Page22>
She looks at the situation with a warm smile and says.
"Ufufu. I wonder if they're smart enough to know what they're doing."
The new teacher makes a scathing remark.
<Page23>
I couldn't keep up with the atmosphere of the classroom so I looked away, making eye contact with Yumizuka in the process. She seems not to be in it as well, looking as absent-minded as I am.
......What is this atmosphere?
The classroom is abuzz with color. What seemed to be a peaceful day has taken an unexpected turn.

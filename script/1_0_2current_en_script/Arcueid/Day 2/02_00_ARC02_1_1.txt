It's been three minutes since HR time.
The replacement teacher for Tohyama-sensei has not arrived.
<Page2>
The classroom is buzzing and order is breaking down.
To be more specific, students are all over the place.
<Page3>
Everyone in the class thinks that if we are going to be left like this, we should play until first period starts.
One more minute. Let's just hold out for one more minute.
After that, we are free to do whatever we want.
<Page4>
"Okay, everyone, be quiet.
Let's start HR!"
<Page5>
The buzz in the air instantly calms down.
The teacher who walks into the classroom is a person I had never seen before, a person I had never expected to see, a person who is not Japanese by any means, in fact, she looks like a university student.
<Page6>
"Huh, What's with the atmosphere?
I know you're all a little ticked off, but......
What am I, a "poisonous" girl?#Oh, no, that's a bit of a minor metaphor. Let's see, the Japanese term is "heart attack" kind of girl? But, my name isn't Sadako."
<Page7>
Isn't that an ancient metaphor? I frown.
The mysterious woman, on the other hand, stands at the podium without a trace of worry, and clears her throat deliberately.
<Page8>
"It's nice to meet you. I'm Noel Aizome, the new substitute for Toyama-sensei, who has been transferred.
I'll only be with you for a month, but I look forward to working with you all."
<Page9>
"I'm in charge of PE and English, my favorite food is Mont Blanc, my favorite gift is cash or web money, and my least favorite word is pet store.
I'm always open to questions, so please don't hesitate to attack me â™¡."
<Page10>
"------"
A faint noise echos through the classroom.
It was a noise from the desk of a boy who was about to get up from his chair when Noel winked at him.
I have to admit that I was taken aback as well.
<Page11>
Noel-sensei is not a strikingly beautiful woman.
She's not a spectacularly beautiful, but she's within my reach,
Although she's a little bit older than me, 
It's like she's filled with a charm that can't be put into words.
Anyway, that was something like a fluffy whip that stimulated the yearnings of high school boys at first sight.
<Page12>
"I have a question! How old are you, Noel-sensei?"
"Where do you live?"
"I want to know how you spend your holidays and what your hobbies are!"
"Who is your favorite type of high school student?"
<Page13>
Immediately, a storm of questions erupts from the boys.
These topics are usually discussed in an anonymous forum, but the guys who were hit by her wink couldn't even wait for that.
<Page14>
The girls look at them coldly as if saying, "Boys are pathetic," but it seems that the scorn of classmates who they are tired of looking at, are not important to them, as they are in the heat of the moment.
<Page15>
"Reacting like a flying fish, thank you.
I'm 25 years old, I live in a rented apartment two stations away, my favorite type of men are mature intellectual men. My hobby is helping out at the church on Sundays. There's a church in the next town over, so if you're interested, I'd be happy if you come to pray."
<Page16>
"Church? What are you, a Sister? I mean, are you a Sister as a hobby?"
"Yes. It's not that uncommon in my country. Well, I'm still just a volunteer, solving confessions of troubled children."
<Page17>
"Oh......oooh......."
The boys are stunned by Noel's unexpectedly good response.
I, too, am a bit taken aback by the novelty of the word "Sister".
<Page18>
Meanwhile, a group of girls are silently playing with their phones.
I casually check the anonymous bulletin board for students.
<Page19>
"What's with that, boys are too stupid..."
"Is she that beautiful?"
"I wonder if she's half French or something"
"I mean, isn't that woman a little too blatant?"
<Page20>
......There you have it.
There is a lot of negative talk on the board.
<Page21>
Thus, the class has become a mysterious space divided into simple factions of "boys" and "girls".
In other words, this is the primitive age of middle school students cursing each other, saying "boys are terrible" and "girls are annoying".
<Page22>
She looks at the situation with a warm smile and says..
"Hmm. I wonder if they're smart enough to know what they're doing?"
The new teacher makes a sleazy remark.
<Page23>
I couldn't keep up with the atmosphere of the classroom, and when I looked away, I saw Yumizuka. Yumizuka, too, seems not to be in it, and is as absent-minded as I am.
......What is this atmosphere?
The classroom is abuzz with color. What seemed to be a peaceful day has taken an unexpected turn.

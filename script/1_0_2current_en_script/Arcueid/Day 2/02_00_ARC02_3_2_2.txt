Let's take a detour somewhere before going home.

It's not that I don't want to go home...... It's not so bad, but I need some more time to get used to that luxurious mansion.
Maybe I'll visit Arihiko's house, or maybe stop by the bookstore in the station building.
No matter what I do with an hour-long detour, I should be able to make it to the mansion before the curfew.

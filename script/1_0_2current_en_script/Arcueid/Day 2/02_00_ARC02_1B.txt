In the living room, I see Akiha and Hisui.
Akiha's uniform is from a famous school for young ladies called Asagami Private Girl's Academy.
<Page2>
"Yo. Morning, Akiha."
"Good morning, Nii-san.
It seems that you woke up late this morning..... well, that is fine. I will just say that you did not sleep well on your first day."
<Page3>
"............"
The word "blunt" comes to mind.
I swallow the words "I was actually up earlier than usual" and sit down on the sofa.
<Page4>
"Hisui, please bring a cup of tea for Nii-san.
I will have another cup as well."
"Understood. Shiki-sama, would you like some sugar?"
"Ah, yes. Just one spoon then."
<Page5>
And so, the awkward morning hour begins.
"..............."
"..............."
Hisui puts the teacup on the table and goes back to the wall and waits.
I silently take a sip of the dark red tea and--- #wait, what's this taste......?
<Page6>
"It's so delicious.......
It's bitter yet sweet, complex yet cleansing on the throat, and it smells just like Christmas......!"
<Page7>
I don't know what I'm saying, but that's how shocked I am.
I learned last night of the grandeur of the Tohno residence, and this tea was no exception.
<Page8>
"This morning we are having Esprit de Noel from Mariage.
The most famous tea stores are in England, but this is from France. It was founded around 1850 and only recently landed in Japan about 15 years ago...... so it is not a major brand, but the quality is good."
<Page9>
"Fufu..... The expression Christmas is so vague but strangely enough, it conveys the nuance."
I'm not sure if my expression was too funny, but Akiha is smiling with pride.
<Page10>
"I hear the price is fair, and it was worth it to try and match my commoner brother. Did you know that a fine leaf is worth its weight in gold?"
<Page11>
It was a dominant, superior look at the poor primates.
Even her gesture when placing the teacup on the saucer is elegant.
<Page12>
"Tch......."
But, unfortunately, she's right.
This tea is the real deal... what was the tea I've been drinking in the afternoon until now? I mean, you could certainly start a business or two with this. If such a thing existed in a time period where entertainment was scarce, even I would be ordering this in desperation.
<Page13>
About 10 minutes passes by.
"..............."
Both Akiha and I just enjoyed the tea without having any conversation.
This was the result of my repeated gazing at the teacup and not being able to think of a topic.
To be honest, it was awkward to say the least.
<Page14>
Still, it wasn't a bad experience for me.
It's not something I can say as I had been left to my own devices until just recently, but just seeing Akiha spending her time like this in peace gives me an indescribable feeling.
I wonder if this is a relief....... I can't help but be happy that Akiha is in front of me right now, no matter what.
<Page15>
While I was immersed in this small sense of satisfaction, I hear a strange sound coming from the hallway.
<Page16>
"Bigger the family, bigger the love!
Chaotic, rude, and finally, insane.
Stampede to the hell!!"
Through the wall, a humming with no tempo whatsoever approaches.
<Page17>
"Haaay, gummoneen!
Gooood morning to Owner-chaaan, too."
<Page18>
After opening the door lively, a woman, dressed as wildly as her absurd appearance, enters.
<Page19>
She's dressed in a jacket that is almost an underwear and a tight leather skirt.
Her unusually long hair is pulled up in a way that doesn't make sense.
She seems to have no makeup on, but her lips are strangely glossy.
Her hair is reddish blonde, and she is tall, making her look like a foreigner.
<Page20>
As far as I can see from her exposed chest and waist, she has an excellent figure.
The woman who arrived is "mature" in her own right, and would be more at home lying on a beach in the middle of summer than in an anachronistic Western-style building like this.
......Well, if it weren't for the oddly fitting lab coat.
<Page21>
"......Good morning, Dr. Arach.
What can I do for you today? I thought the routine check-up was yesterday."
<Page22>
"No, I wasn't in the mood for it yesterday.
When I was watching the sunset, I got frustrated, so I abandoned my research and ran out to the city. Well, frankly speaking, I skipped work. So, I came here in the morning to get some work done today!
Oh, maid-chan, please give me some tea. Four or five spoonfuls of sugar, or six if you feel like it?"
<Page23>
The woman in white coat strolls into the living room.
Naturally, her eyes meet mine as she sits down on the sofa.
<Page24>
"What? Whaaat? Whaaaaaat---?
Oh? Hmmm? Mmmmmmmmm---?"
<Page25>
She's staring at me.
After taking her time observing, a satisfied expression appears on her face. #The woman smiles, and---
<Page26>
"Hi---hihi, Uhihihihihihihihihihihihi!
It's too good to be true---!
What's this, the master has come up with a plan to kill me with laughter? That's great, dead mast and all the A-10!
Oh, my God, it's like Macbeth in the house! You're so ready to kill or be killed, you're so ready for tragedy!"
<Page27>
The woman is laughing from her stomach.
"..............."
I can only frown.
What's with this high-spirited person? Akiha calls her doctor, but.......
<Page28>
"Dr. Arach.
May I introduce you to Nii-san?"
As if she couldn't stand the sight of me being so lost, Akiha clears her throat and chides the woman in white.
<Page29>
"Hmm? Are you're talking about me? Or Shiki-chan?
Leave it, there's no point.
I've heard about him from Makihisa-kun.
He's not interested in the affairs of a stranger like me, right? If he's going to be useful, why don't he go ahead and tell Owner-chan?"
<Page30>
Makihisa-kun.....?
So, is this woman an acquaintance of my father?
<Page31>
"Yes, I've always been a carefree woman, like a webless spider drifting in the wind, 
but I had a chance to meet Makihisa-kun.
"If you have nowhere else to go, why don't you come live with us?"
He was so cool about it! #But alas, He's not reaaaaaaally my type, so I simply turned him down, and now I'm friends with the head of the family? #Can you believe that?"
<Page32>
I look at Akiha.
......It takes a lot of courage to talk to this woman.
<Page33>
"Yes. Dr. Arach was father's junior at the university.
Now, as father's friend, she is my advisor."
<Page34>
"Eeeh? I don't like it when you call me that.
Pro-fes-sor. I'll cry if you don't call me Professor Arach with love and affection!"
<Page35>
Instead of crying, Dr. Arach smiles and laughs.
......But.
She smiles, but her eyes are fixed on my face like a sticky thread, as they have been ever since she came into this room.
<Page36>
"Here you go, Arach-sama. Your tea is ready."
<Page37>
Hisui intervenes.
Not reading the atmosphere...... no, it seems that Hisui's attitude of not being influenced by the atmosphere of the place neutralized the tension created by Arach.
<Page38>
"Oh, maid-chan really now. You really are the epitome of a maid."
......She's sulking because she was interrupted.
With one hand on her hip, she drinks the sugar-filled tea in one gulp as if drinking a sports drink.
<Page39>
"Ohh, nice sugar! It's flowing all through my organs, I mean, it's melting away my uterus and ovaries! I'm getting excited!
<Page40>
"Well then, I'm off for a routine check-up! There's something wrong with the air conditioning in the main bathroom, isn't there? I know, I know. I'll just do a quick check and then add an ion cluster or something while I'm at it!"
<Page41>
With a high-pitched laugh, Arach crosses the living room and heads to the hallway. .......However.
As she touches the doorknob, the woman turns to me and says, 
<Page42>
"Nice to meet you, Shiki-chan. How about we get along with each other?
A lot is going to happen now, but...
If you really can't do anything about it anymore, how about you come and talk to me?"
<Page43>
The unwanted guest walks away, humming the same tune as when she arrived.
"..............."
"..............."
An inexpressible silence envelops the living room.
<Page44>
"Hey, Akiha."
"I do not know much about Dr. Arach either.
But due to father's will, she is in charge of the maintenance and management of the main building. I heard that father was a very good architect. But it seems that the construction industry was just a side business."
<Page45>
Akiha assures me firmly.
"What's with that woman?" I was the first to ask.
"I am not going to take any more questions." she says.
<Page46>
"If you'll excuse me. Akiha-sama, it's time for you to go to school.......#Hmm? There seems to be a tense atmosphere in here.
Haha. Did you already frighten Shiki-san by saying something unreasonable in the morning?"
<Page47>
"Hold on. What do you mean by "already"?
First, I do not talk about unreasonable things. I am merely asking for common sense."
<Page48>
Kohaku-san is impressed by Akiha's statement.
It's only the second day, but I think I'm starting to understand the relationship between these two.
<Page49>
"I will be heading to school then.
Nii-san, as I said last night, curfew is strictly enforced. Did you check the news last night?"
"No, I haven't. Someone took my mobile phone. Unreasonably so."
<Page50>
"I see. Then, I will have the morning paper ready in the living room tomorrow.
You might want to get up early and read through the day's news."
<Page51>
There you have it.
It was an ironclad attitude that bounced back my little sarcasm in no time at all.
<Page52>
"According to the news, the body of a vagrant was found at the north exit of Souya Station last night. It is being reported that he froze to death due to malnutrition or succumbed to blood loss."
<Page53>
"Whatever the truth is, it seems that the downtown area is not safe these days. It would be a disgrace to the Tohno family if we were to get involved in a trivial incident while out at such time.
As soon as school is over, please try to get back to the mansion before the sun goes down."
<Page54>
After reminding me of the curfew, Akiha leaves the living room.
But... before the sun goes down means I have to be back by six o'clock. Wasn't the curfew set at eight o'clock?

"------"
......My neck feels strangely hot. It's swollen and tender.
I wonder if that's why. I feel like I've lost track of where I was going.
<Page2>
The night is covering the city like water that has leaked out.
The noise is incomparable to that of the morning.
The headlights of cars passing by.
The crowds of people being thrown out of the station, or being sucked in.
The number of school uniforms has dwindled,
and people in colorful clothes are strolling about.
<Page3>
"------"
I stand up from my seat on the bench.
It's time to go.
I have no reason to go there at all, but I turn my feet and head downtown.
<Page4>
"------"
I take a side street off the main road.
Rather than a street, it is a blind spot between buildings.
<Page5>
There are no people here around me.
There is no noise.
There is no sign of life.
Just a rustling sound coming from behind me.
<Page6>
The lights of the vending machines are too bright.
Too many conveniences of civilization, incongruous to this place.
It is too bright, so I walk past it.
I turn my feet to the darker, more appropriate darkness of the night.
<Page7>
......into a narrower, more secluded darkness.
I put my hand on the rusty iron fence.
If I open it and go deep enough, I'll find---
<Page8>
"Hey, you there."
"---Eh?"
<Page9>
I stop in my tracks.
I wake up with a light spark of dizziness.
......I don't know what's going on.
Why did I come to this place?
Why did I try to go this far back......?
<Page10>
"I'm sorry. Do you have a hundred yen on you?"
When I turn around, I see a strange girl in front of the vending machine.
"I've been trying to buy some juice, ......but I'm stuck without any change.", she says.
<Page11>
"..............."
Perhaps I felt guilty for trying to go further into the alleyway, but I let myself be carried away by the atmosphere and hand over a hundred yen.
<Page12>
"Thanks. Thank you very much."
She inserts the hundred yen into the vending machine, and presses the button.
The girl takes out the can that the machine dropped.
She frowns, looking disappointed.
<Page13>
"Taking a walk at this time of night is carefree, isn't it?
Isn't the lady at the house waiting for you?"
"Eh--- yeah......!"
<Page14>
I look at my phone.
The clock ruthlessly strikes 7:40--- oh no, there's only 20 minutes left until curfew!
<Page15>
I rush out of the alleyway.
-----However.
"Please, wait!"
The girl stops me again.
<Page16>
"What? I'm sorry, but I have to hurry---"
She throws the juice can at me.
I rush to catch it, but wasn't it the one she bought?
<Page17>
"Take it."
"Um.......why?"
"None of them tasted good."
<Page18>
The girl says grumpily, and strolls past me.
<Page19>
"No, no, this is not time to be distracted.......!"
I hurry up and start running too.
Breaking the curfew on the first day is bad as a brother, no, as a human being even. I have to get back to the mansion before the thunder of the head of the family strikes me.......!

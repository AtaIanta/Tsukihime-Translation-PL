It's after school now#.
I didn't feel dizzy from anemia today, and personally, it was a very peaceful day.
However, an unprecedented virus has spread in the classroom, and until a short while ago, the air was filled with unrest.
<Page2>
The girls called this disturbance among the boys as "Noel Fever".
It could also be called "Noel Measles".
The conflict between the boys and the girls did not stop until lunchtime, and the battle was postponed until tomorrow.
<Page3>
On the other hand, the boys who didn't catch the Noel Fever were praised by the girls' group, but branded as impotent, traitors, and are accused to have preference for little girls by the boy's group. This is a rather a silly story.
<Page4>
"......Well, she's certainly not the type of beauty you see too often, that Noel-sensei."
<Page5>
But I still don't understand why everyone is so crazy about her.
If you're talking about beauty, Akiha is much more---
<Page6>
"Oh, there you are. Got a minute, Shiki?"
The person who is the center of this turmoil arrives at an unbelievable timing!
<Page7>
"Oh. You look like you're about to blow your heart out of your mouth.
Is there something in your mind you don't want to reveal?"
<Page8>
"N-no, nothing like that, not at all.
......Um. Leaving that aside, what can I do for you, Noel-sensei?"
Swallowing the guilt of comparing Noel-sensei to Akiha, I try my best to calmly divert the topic.
<Page9>
However......
She smiles at me as if she can see right through me.
<Page10>
"......Fufu. I like the sound of "Noel-sensei". It's much better than being called senpai.
I'm still getting used to Japan, so I'm a little nervous, but I think I'll be addicted to being called "Sensei" by a naive boy like you. ---It's kind of dirty and a little bit exciting."
<Page11>
"Um, Noel-sensei......?
Wait, y-you're a bit too close---"
<Page12>
"Don't worry about it. Or rather, you should pretend to be dull and keep quiet.
Hey, look............my neck, isn't it beautiful?"
<Page13>
Was it the tension, or the magic of the setting sun?
Her voice slips into my ear, not from the front, but from right behind me, as if she were whispering in my ear.
<Page14>
"Don't be so cautious.
......Just lace your fingers with mine. Just transferring heat. Just entrusting my body.
......Yes. I just want you to devour me......."
<Page15>
Her breaths come closer. Our legs entwine. She puts her arm around my back to block my escape.
---In my field of vision.
A strangely glamorous and slippery neck of a woman---
<Page16>
"......Look......the sound of my heartbeats alone is making you melt.......?
So forget about it, forget about yourself, forget about......everything that's in the way, take it all away......the formalities, the glasses---"
<Page17>
Her snake-like fingers touch the frame of my glasses.
In a moment. My body jumps away from hers with only the fear of "not wanting to see".
<Page18>
"Just kidding, it was a hands-on commemoration of my new position â™¡.
In Japanese terms, you call it a little skinship? Or not, an exchange of business cards maybe? Mmm, either way, it's still just a casual thing so don't worry about it, OK?"
<Page19>
"......You're kidding? Noel-sensei."
......I don't think these are the right words for what just happened.
For a teacher, such a prank is too much---
<Page20>
"......What was the purpose of this in the first place?
You sounded like you were looking for me."
<Page21>
"Ah, that's all right now. I just needed your help with something. I'm done with that too.
So, goodbye Shiki-kun. Be careful not to end up like Toyama-sensei."
<Page22>
Noel-sensei waves her hand as she walks away.
I can't stop thinking about what she just said---
C:>I ask a question about Toyama-sensei.
C:>I decide not to think about it.

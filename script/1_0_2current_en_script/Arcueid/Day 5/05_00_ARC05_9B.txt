A block of ice slides through the air.
The ice turns into spears and bullets that come to shoot me in the head.
---Should I avoid them or take them on?
Do I continue to hide, or do I drop my cover here?
I subconsciously make a decision.
<Page2>
"---!"
A headache strains my brain.
I Self-consciously focus my sight on the spear.
If that line is the death of existence.
I will kill the spear, the inertia of the shot, the sub-zero bond, right before my eyes. ......!
<Page3>
Death grazed my temples.
I bring my knife to bear on the flying icicles. Man is a wild beast. We are wild beasts. We had such a level of dynamic vision and reflexes a long time ago.
<Page4>
If my body can still move, a weapon like this is no more than a large piece of rubble.
But...
<Page5>
But this defeats a head-on "surprise attack".
His eyes are telling me...
I saw it.
I don't care about reason or logic. I just know I'll never let you go on from there again.
<Page6>
Now I'm completely out of moves.
Was this the right place to discard my trump card?
---Not good.
But there's no other way.
The only way to survive is to expose my hand here.
So I have to search with all my might for what I can get in return.
<Page7>
"Ah---!"
I cut it down with the least amount of movement.
Even if there's no way to get close to it, I'll conserve my energy as much as I can.
<Page8>
Two minutes left until the limit of activity.
---The excitement drives out the fear.
My view of life and death is being reversed by my desperate struggle.
<Page9>
""...... it's not a miracle.
But it's not common sense either.
What is the logic behind letting my thirst pass like water?""
<Page10>
There's a small gap in the ice's sweep.
It concentrates the cold waves flooding in from itself into a single point, creating a colder vortex,
<Page11>
""...... Spare me, but just die.
Don't make my heart race too much.""
It shoots out chunks of ice like a pulley sliding through the frozen atmosphere. ......!
<Page12>
I slice off the murderous bullet.
As long as I'm standing in front of Arcueid, I have no choice but to stop what's being shot towards here.
<Page13>
At this distance, the ice spear will reach me in 1.5 seconds.
I can maintain this state as long as my body moves.
In the meantime, think of what I can do.
<Page14>
Vlov hasn't taken a single step.
Why isn't he moving? If he thinks I'm a threat, there's no reason to cut corners. Then it's the other way around. I hypothesize that it's not that he doesn't need to move because he has flying tools, but rather that he can't move when he's in that state.
<Page15>
He was driven into a corner by Arcueid and ran out of fuel in the form of blood. That cold air should be seen as a last-ditch self-defense measure of a monster on the verge of death.
<Page16>
It's a wild theory. But it makes sense.
The immobilized vlov protects himself by deploying a curse in all directions.
Regardless of whether it's hot or cold, any living thing that comes close to him will die.
<Page17>
If you get within 10 meters of it, you'll freeze to death in 2 seconds.
At this rate I'll eventually fall too. It's the same as when a person is lost in the snow and falls asleep. In the case of humans, when the body temperature is below 34 degrees Celsius or above 43 degrees Celsius, the brain cells shut down and consciousness disappears.
<Page18>
Observe the whole thing, not just the individual.
Don't interrupt your thoughts, let the knife slide automatically the moment you see it.
<Page19>
In the process, revise your guess.
That cold wave is spreading in all directions.
But is its density really constant?
<Page20>
The fact that the surface is the coldest means that there are temperature differences within the cold wave. It is a criterion of strength or weakness, but it has a drawback.
It is a defense for all directions, but it is not invincible in all directions.
<Page21>
""...... Protecting the Lord at the edge of death? It's brave, but it's not enough."
The long spear that had struck down Alcade was taken from the shadows again.
Perhaps that's what spurred him on, because behind him, a particularly large ice tree sprouts branches...
""---So. By the numbers, let's push. ......!""
<Page22>
I'll stop thinking and put all my abilities into intercepting it.
This is impossible. I can't kill them all.
There's always a bullet somewhere. ---I can't allow that.
I can't be so naive.
I can't even try.
If I bleed out, that's the end. The cold air won't give me a minute to stop it from killing me.
So I'll kill it. struggle.
I completely renew my consciousness and look down only at the "line".
<Page23>
The total number of prey deployed is twenty-six.
I stare at the plan view to see what I can cut first and what I can miss.
---In between, I saw it for sure.
The location of death surpasses the line.
That point is the ultimate point of death that creates the line.
<Page24>
"---,tsu"
The wall of death looming before me.
But I saw it, now I'm sure I saw the same thing.
Just as I'm going to die here.
There's a chance he'll die here too. ......!
"Ahhhhhhhhhhh!"
<Page25>
But I've come to a conclusion.
Tohno Shiki has no more means of survival.
The ice spear cut into the flesh of his right side and left thigh.
His body was being drained of heat from the wounds.
His ligaments screamed from the repetition of rapid braking.
Cells are being destroyed by the ultra-low temperature.
My fingertips go numb and limbs lose control.
<Page26>
"---,ha---"
An inevitable predicament.
A lost battle with no chance of victory.
You're going to be killed in a minute anyway.
Vlov, Arcueid, and whoever else is watching this mess won't suspect my death.
Above all, I myself have no hope of survival.
And yet...
<Page27>
"Ha------a"
A deep-seated animal instinct.
In this predicament, #why am I smiling?
<Page28>
"Aha!"
The ice spear struck Arcueid in the face.
Oh no. I couldn't even see Arcueid's position behind me.
<Page29>
It didn't pierce her, but Arcueid was rubbing her face with one hand.
What the hell is wrong with her, she's unharmed after a direct hit to the face?
<Page30>
"Oh my God, ......!"
I knew she was a bullshit creature, but once again I was flabbergasted.
Arcueid plunged one hand into the ground and lifted a chunk of earth as if scooping it up with a shovel.
<Page31>
She then threw the rock at Vlov, as if to say, "It doesn't hurt."
<Page32>
A huge spear crushes Arcueid's throw.
Vlov is unharmed.
You can't just kill him with a simple attack.
---But...
But Arcueid's counterattack put the final piece in place.
<Page33>
We've come to a decision.
There's only one way to kill him. If I can get close enough before the cold wave stops my body, I can kill him for sure.
<Page34>
But how?
My legs are too slow to zero in on that distance in less than two seconds. I need the help of something faster.
For better luck, I'd like to get within range of him through the thinnest part of the ultra-cold. It's not going to be easy, but I have to do it.
<Page35>
If I don't do something, I'll die for sure. I don't have a choice.
It's not a question of "can I do it?"
It's a question of "how can I do it".
<Page36>
Be prepared.
If there is any way to get close, this is it,
C:>...... throwing.
C:>...... sliding.
C:>...... towing.

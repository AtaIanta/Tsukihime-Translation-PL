"...... Well, it's not a mistake. 
I'd really prefer a pair, though. Two women or a man and a woman. 
"Come on, nerd, welcome to the club! 
We haven't had any challengers in a while, so we're in trouble! We'll be killed if we don't get any money, right? 
<Page2>
Laughing, the man called Hal comes around behind me. 
He blocked my path of retreat to keep me from escaping. 
<Page3>
"Okay, I guess I’m allowed to be alone with a guy once in a while. 
I'll take you to the part-time venue." 
The man called Hal pushes the button for the elevator. 
<Page4>
A driving sound echoed in the darkness. 
This was the only place that seemed to have electricity. 
<Page5>
"In." 
"............" 
...... I don't know if I can go into the elevator like this. 
Once inside, it's a locked room. 
If the two men seized me, I would not be able to resist with my arm strength. 
<Page6>
...... Let's be cautious. 
This is the place. 
1. find out a little more about the story. ^@t 2. Decline. 
"......!" 
A sudden shock knocked me unconscious. 
The brain's hypothalamus malfunctions, causing 
The autonomic nerves that control the limbs are disconnected. 
<Page7>
"Shah! Straaaaike!" 
...... I hear a spluttering in the background. 
He hit me in the back of the head with something that looked like a baseball bat. 
<Page8>
"It's a pain in the ass. 
Don't get all hinky on me when I get here, damn it." 
<Page9>
The ...... elevator is descending. 
In my dazed state, I could see the "B1" button glowing. 
......B1...... basement floor...... underground, they will take you to the parking lot......? 
<Page10>
...... Damn. 
My consciousness is strong, but my vision is blurry. 
His arms and legs were flapping up and down, even though he hadn't given any such orders. 
As I fell down, I felt a slimy, unpleasant sensation on my face. 
<Page11>
As the elevator opened, it was illuminated by an intense light. 
It was too bright to see what was going on outside. 
"Let's get him down. Give me a hand." 
"Oh no, you're going straight to M instead of P! Toshi, you're relentless!" 
<Page12>
The ...... duo lifted me up and carried me out of the elevator and placed me on the floor. 
I thought I was going to be thrown off, but there, the work was strangely polite. 
<Page13>
The ...... footsteps are moving away. 
The ...... duo took the elevator and left the place. 
<Page14>
"---, ------ 
Whatever it was, it helped. 
I’m still alive. It's a serious wound, but not fatal. 
<Page15>
I don't know where I am, but in a few more minutes, the paralysis in my limbs will subside and I will be able to move. 
That way, I can fight back. 
<Page16>
Next time, I’ll be on our guard. I’ll get one of those two, and next time I’ll find out what's going on... 
<Page17>
"What?" 
The only consciousness that was still alive froze. 
<Page18>
What the hell is this place? 
Air like a mucous membrane. 
What the hell is this place? 
---The smell of fat, meat, and blood. 
What the hell is this place? 
A number of bars and a living corpse. 
What is this place, ......? 
<Page19>
It's not an underground parking garage. 
Nowhere on earth. 
There's no way this kind of fertilizer can be found in our city. 
<Page20>
"Huh..." 
Something is coming. I hear a lot of footsteps. 
I have a headache. 
I feel nauseous. 
The sound of footsteps approaching. 
My instincts screamed at me that I would only be attacked if I stayed here. 
<Page21>
"Uh..." 
My legs still wouldn't move. 
A lot of something is coming, dragging a lot of rotten flesh with it. 
"Ahhhh...!" 
They are stuck. they won’t move. 
I cried and put all my strength into them, but my legs wouldn't budge a muscle! 
<Page22>
"Oh, my...!" 
With his hands, he crawls across the blood- and shit-stained floor. 
Anything else, it doesn't matter. 
I need to get out of here as soon as possible. 
Elevator. 
If I can get back to the elevator, I'll be able to return to my world. 
<Page23>
I have to hurry. 
I have to hurry. 
Come on, come on. 
Don't worry, we'll make it. 
I'm sure it will help. 
To the elevator. To the elevator. 
If I could just reach that elevator that was stuck in the air like a gondola...

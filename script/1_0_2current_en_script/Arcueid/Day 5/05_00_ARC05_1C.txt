But even if I say that, I've never done anything like this before.
That being said, the only things I can think of regarding first aid are things like antiseptic, gauze for covering a wound, bandages, and painkillers.
The other thing is nutrition. At any rate, she needs to get some nutrition.
<Page2>
Fortunately, I have a ton of money.
Even if it's an amateurish idea, it's better than coming up empty-handed. You never know what might be of help to that woman.
Believing that, I buy whatever I could think of.
<Page3>
"Hey wait, that tickles!"
"........"
<Page4>
Ignoring the tension in her voice, I apply the gauze as delicately as I can.
The wound on Arcueid's abdomen wasn't that big.
<Page5>
...... No, a horizontal four-centimeter-deep wound would have been fatal for any human, but according to Arcueid,
"A wound like this is not a big of deal at all!"
Or something like that.
<Page6>
In any case, it seems her internal organs will heal on its own in no time. This is so out of the ordinary that I don't want to question it.
The bleeding has stopped and all that is left to do is to close the wound, but from that point on, things didn't go as planned.
<Page7>
Although it might be a waste of time for such a large wound, I apply some antiseptic to it to prevent bacterial infection.
I was afraid that she would go crazy from being soaked, but she doesn't budge at all. Rather...
"Hmm? Did you do something just now?"
It appears she is insensitive...... no, more like tough.
<Page8>
"...... All right."
I place a gauze on the wound and carefully wrap a bandage around it.
"Ahahaha, stop it, you're way too good, Shiki!"
<Page9>
Arcueid gives out a a cheerful laugh for whatever reason.
Despite being unresponsive to the antiseptic, it seems that the bandage tickles her.
<Page10>
"......"
I ignore her and fasten the bandage on with a pin. Wounds are said to stop bleeding if you bind them a bit tighter, so I give it a final squeeze.
"――― Ouch. Hey, I'm deducting points for that, Shiki."
<Page11>
"........"
Phew. With this, I've done everything that I could do for the time being.
Incidentally, I've closed the curtains again out of concern for Arcueid.
<Page12>
"...... Now then. I only tried to make it look good, but how is it?
Are you able to move, Arcueid?"
<Page13>
"Yeah, I have no problem moving around. But my insides are still pretty messed up, so I won't be able to move around properly."
<Page14>
"Is that so. Well, you'll have to deal with that on your own.
My speciality is in cutting. Healing is outside of my jurisdiction."
I move away from Arcueid and sit down against the wall.
<Page15>
"Thank you for your patience, you can go to sleep now.
You'll get better as soon as you sleep and get your strength back, right? I'll keep an eye on you so just be quiet and go to sleep."
<Page16>
"No, my wounds won't recover even if I sleep. It's just like you said, sleeping will only help me recover from fatigue.
In my case, my strength recovers purely with the passage of time. Once it turns to night, I'll be able to recover enough to move normally."
<Page17>
Even if she says that, it's still not good for my mental health to see her in pain.
<Page18>
"――― Just go to sleep already.
Even now, you look like you're in pain just by talking to me."
"That may be true, but you are awake after all.
It'd be a waste if I were to sleep right now."
<Page19>
Arcueid sits upright on the bed.
She's in full-on chatter mode.
"――― Geez."
I don't have a choice.
I've got some questions I need to ask her as well, so I'll just talk to her for a bit.
<Page20>
"Arcueid. Can I ask you about the hotel from yesterday?"
"...... That's right. I guess this sort of conversation is bound to happen in this situation."
<Page21>
"That guy from yesterday...... I believe he called himself Vlov, but what the heck is he? 
I understand that he's a vampire. Those grandiose clothes and such make him look much more vampire-like than you after all. But―――"
<Page22>
That blue flame. What was that flame that filled the hallway and burning nothing but humans? It was too far apart from the image of a vampire.
<Page23>
"Hmph. What do you mean by more 'vampire-like' than me?
...... Still, it is just like you said.
As for him, he has a body that doesn't break, nor is his principle particularly large-scale. He is the kind of orthodox vampire that humans would imagine.
――― That is, if you exclude that sea of flame, right?"
<Page24>
"Exactly...... As I thought, that fire was abnormal even from your point of view, right? Is he stronger than you?"
...... As soon as I say that, Arcueid lets out an exaggerated sigh.
<Page25>
"Well you see. I was killed by a certain somebody, which made me drop to a level where I have to 'fight' a second-rate Dead Apostle like him.
If you were to compare my scale with Vlov's right now, he would be slightly stronger."
<Page26>
"...... I-I see.
So if you were in your normal condition, you would be able to defeat him somehow, right?"
<Page27>
"What do you mean 'somehow'? It wouldn't even be a fight in that case!
Geez, who do you think is responsible for this humiliating scenario in the first place? If I were to fight him seriously, I would have crushed that wannabe Ancestor with just a glare!"
<Page28>
Ah, I made her mad......
But right now, I'm not interested in these 'what-if' scenarios.
What I really want to know is whether Arcueid can defeat that vampire in these current circumstances......
<Page29>
"I can't. Vlov is stronger than me right now. #My performance is simply lower than his, so if we fight him without a plan, then we'll get killed."
"T-that's quite direct coming from you. Even though you were so angry earlier."
<Page30>
"It's just a fact. This situation is very obvious, so there's no point in predicting or hoping for the best."
<Page31>
...... I get a little intimidated when she says that.
When it comes to fighting, Arcueid has a very thorough and severe thought process.
When I witness her cold-hearted nature in front of me, I come to realize again, even after this time, that she is indeed a vampire.

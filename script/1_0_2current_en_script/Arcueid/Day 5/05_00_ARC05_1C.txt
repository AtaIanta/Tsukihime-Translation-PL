But I've never done anything like this before.
I said `first aid`, but all I can think of is antiseptic, gauze to seal the wound, bandages, and painkillers.
The other thing is nutrition. At any rate, she needs to get some nutrition.
<Page2>
Fortunately, I have a lot of money.
Even if it's an amateurish idea, it's better to have something extra rather than not having anything. You never know what might help.
Believing that, I buy whatever I could think of.
<Page3>
"Hey wait, that tickles!"
"........"
<Page4>
Ignoring the tension in her voice, I apply the gauze as delicately as I can.
The wound on Arcueid's abdomen isn't that big.
<Page5>
...No, a horizontal four-centimeter-deep wound would be fatal for any human, but, according to Arcueid,
"It's not a big deal at all!"
Oh well.
<Page6>
Apparently, her internal organs will heal on their own. This is so out of the ordinary that I don't want to talk about it.
The bleeding has stopped and all that is left to do is to close the wound, but from that point on, things didn't go as planned.
<Page7>
Although it might be a waste of time for such a large wound, I apply some antiseptic to it to prevent bacterial infection.
I'm afraid that she would go crazy because the bandage is soaking in antiseptic, but she doesn't budge at all. Rather...
"Hmm? Did you just do something?"
Is she insensitive...no, she's just tough.
<Page8>
"...All right."
I put a gauze on the wound and carefully wrap a bandage around it.
"Ahaha, stop it, you're too good at that, Shiki!"
<Page9>
Apparently, this is funny for Arcueid.
The bandage seems to tickle her, even the antiseptic doesn't even faze her.
<Page10>
"......"
I ignore her and fasten the bandage on with a pin. Wounds are said to stop bleeding if you bind them a bit tighter, so I give it a final squeeze.
"―――Ouch. Hey, I'm deducting points for that, Shiki."
<Page11>
"........"
Phew. Well, that's all I can do for now.
Incidentally, I've closed the curtains again out of concern for Arcueid.
<Page12>
"...Alright. I at least made it look good, but how is it?
Can you move alright, Arcueid?"
<Page13>
"Yeah, it feels fine to move. But my insides are still pretty messed up, so I won't be able to move around properly."
<Page14>
"I see. Well, you'll have to deal with that on your own.
I specialize in slicing, not in healing."
I move away from Arcueid and sit down against the wall.
<Page15>
"Good night, you can go to sleep now.
You'll get better as soon as you sleep and get your strength back, right? I'll keep an eye on you so just sleep quietly."
<Page16>
"No, sleep will not heal my wounds. As you said, sleep can only heal fatigue.
In my case, my strength recovers purely with the passage of time. By nightfall, I'll be able to recover enough to move normally."
<Page17>
That said, it's still not good for my mental health to see her in pain like that. //needs a proper translation
<Page18>
"―――Just go to sleep already.
You look like you're in pain just by talking to me."
"Yes, but since you're awake.
It seems like a waste if I sleep now."
<Page19>
Arcueid sits upright on the bed.
She's in full-on chatter mode.
"―――Oh, c'mon."
I don't have a choice.
I've got some questions I need to ask her as well, so I'll just talk to her a bit.
<Page20>
"Arcueid. Can I ask you about the hotel yesterday?"
"...Oh well, I guess if it's you and me this sort of conversation is bound to happen."
<Page21>
"That guy from yesterday, Vlov or whatever, what the heck is with him? 
I understand he's a vampire. He had those overblown clothes and what-not, far more vampire-ish than you at least, but―――"
<Page22>
Those blue flames filled the hallway and burned humans only. It was too far from the image of a vampire.
<Page23>
"Hmph. What do you mean more vampire-ish than me?
...Still, it's as you say.
This guy, his body isn't falling apart nor is his Principle particularly large-scale. The kind of orthodox vampire humans would imagine.
―――Except for that river of fire, right?"
<Page24>
"Yeah that. ...That fire was abnormal from your point of view as well, right? Is he stronger than you?"
...And then. Arcueid lets out an exaggerated sigh.
<Page25>
"Well you see. With me having been killed by a certain someone, I've fallen to level where I'd have to `fight` such a second-rate Dead Apostle.
If you were to compare the my current <scale of existence|Lifescale> to that of Vlov's, his would be slightly higher."
<Page26>
"...I-I see.
So if you were completely normal, could you manage to defeat someone like him?"
<Page27>
"What do you mean, it'll be a completely one-sided fight!
Oh, do you know who I owe this humiliation to? I could have crushed that newbie Ancestor with just a glare!"
<Page28>
Ah, she's pissed off....
But right now, I don't want to think about that.
Realistically speaking, I'd like to know if she can defeat that vampire....
<Page29>
"I wouldn't be able to. Right now, Vlov is above me. In terms of pure ability I'm below him so if I fought him without a plan I'd be killed."
"T-that's quite direct coming from you, you were so angry earlier."
<Page30>
"It's just a fact. I'm not going to jump to conclusions and hope for the best, because it's obvious."
<Page31>
...I get a little intimidated when she says that.
When it comes to fighting, Arcueid has a thoroughly serious thought process.
When I see her cold-heartedness, I realize again, after all this time, that she is also a vampire.

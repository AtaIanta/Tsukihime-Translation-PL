But I've never done anything like this before.
I said first aid, but all I could think of was antiseptic, gauze to seal the wound, bandages, and painkillers.
And then there's nutrition. They need to be nourished anyway.
<Page2>
Fortunately, we have plenty of money.
An amateurish idea or not, it's better to use something rather than leave it as it is. You never know what might help her.
Believing in that thought, I bought everything I could think of.
<Page3>
"Hey, that tickles!"
"..............."
<Page4>
Ignoring the nervousness in her voice, I applied the gauze as delicately as I could.
The wound on Arcueid's abdomen isn't that big.
<Page5>
...... No, a horizontal four-centimeter-deep laceration would be fatal for any human, but, according to Arcueid.
"It's not a big deal at all!"
That's right.
<Page6>
Apparently, her internal organs will heal on their own. It's so out of the ordinary that I don't want to talk about it.
The bleeding has stopped and all that is left to do is close the wound, but things didn't go to plan from this point on.
<Page7>
It might be counterproductive for a wound this large, but I'll apply some antiseptic to it in case it gets infected by pathogens.
I was afraid that she would lash out as the antiseptic sinks in, but Arcueid is completely unfazed. If anything.
"Hmm? Did you just do something?
Is this dull.....no, it's because she's sturdy.
<Page8>
"...... Good."
I put gauze on the wound and carefully wrap a bandage around it.
"Hahaha, stop it, you're too good at that Shiki!"
<Page9>
This is so fun, Arcueid laughs merrily.
The bandage seemed to tickle her, even though the antiseptic hadn't even fazed her.
<Page10>
"............"
I Ignore her and fastened the bandage on with a pin. Wounds are said to stop bleeding if you bind them a bit tighter, so I gave it a final squeeze.
"......Ouch. That's a deduction, Shiki."
<Page11>
"..............."
Phew. Well, that's all I can do for now.
Incidentally, I close the curtains again out of concern for Arcueid.
<Page12>
"...... Well. I tried to look good, but lets see.
Can you move, Arcueid?"
<Page13>
Yeah, it feels fine to move. But it's still a mess on the inside, so I won't be able to move around properly."
<Page14>
"I see. Well, you'll have to deal with that on your end.
I specialize in cutting, healing is out of my reach."
I move away from Arcueid and sit down beside the wall.
<Page15>
"You can go to sleep now, good night.
As soon as I sleep and get my strength back, I'll be fine, right? I'll keep an eye on you, so you can sleep peacefully."
<Page16>
"No, sleep won't heal your wounds. Like you said, the only thing that sleep can heal is fatigue.
In my case, my strength recovers purely with the passage of time. By night, I should have healed enough to move around normally."
<Page17>
That said, it's still not good for my mental health to see her in pain like that.
<Page18>
"Just go to sleep.
You look like you're in pain just talking to me."
"But since you are awake...
I don't want to go to sleep."
<Page19>
Arcueid sits upright on the bed.
She's in full-on chatter mode.
"Oh C'mon."
I don't have a choice.
I've got some questions I need to ask her aswell, so let's talk with Arcueid a bit.
<Page20>
"Arcueid. Can I ask you about the hotel yesterday?"
"......That's right. When it comes to me and Shiki, it'd turn out out to be a conversation like this after all
<Page21>
"Yesterday that guy ...... said something like "Vlov", but what the hell is he?
I know he's a vampire. His bombastic outfit and the like makes him fit the part much more than you after all. But....
<Page22>
Those blue flames. What sort of fire fills the hallway but burns only humans? This is too far removed from the image of a vampire.
<Page23>
 "Mmm. What do you mean, he's more like you?
...... But you are correct Shiki.
That guy, his body wasn't falling apart, and his principle was small in scale. He's probably the orthodox vampire that humans envision.
---except for that river of fire.
<Page24>
"That's it. ...... After all, is that fire abnormal from your point of view? Is he stronger than you?"
......so. Arcueid bluntly sighs.
<Page25>
"That's right. I was been killed by someone, and now I'm down to the level of having trouble fighting those second-rate mortals.
If you were to compare me with Vlov right now, he is slightly more powerful.
<Page26>
"...... Oh, I see.
If it was normal you, could you manage to defeat someone like him?"
<Page27>
"Usually it's not even a fight!
Who do you think is the reason I have to endure this humiliation? If it were no for that, I could have flattened that new apprentice with just a glare!"
<Page28>
Oh, I'm so pissed off. ......
But right now, I don't want to think about that nonsense.
As a practical matter, I'd like to know if she can defeat that vampire .......
<Page29>
"I can't. Vlov is better than me right now.
We're simply outperforming him, if we fight him without a plan, he'll surely kill us."
"You're quite decisive, aren't you? You were so angry earlier.
<Page30>
"It's just a fact. I'm not going to speculate or hope for the best, because it's obvious."
<Page31>
........I gor a little intimidated when you said that.
When it comes to fighting, Arcueid has a thoroughly serious thought process.
When I see her cold-heartedness, I realize again, after all this time, that she is also a vampire.

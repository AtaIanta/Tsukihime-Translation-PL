"Traffic restrictions on Route 305 will be lifted by 5:00 tomorrow morning.
The highway has just been opened.

"Ah, those guys who were undercover for some reason.
It's a two-man team, right? Call the low-level guys over to my hotel and have them stand by. We'll use them if we have to.

"Well, it's just a job to pull the trigger on an immobile target. If you ignore the psychological toll, though, right?"

"Bring the car around, Karius.
We're going to start making the rounds."

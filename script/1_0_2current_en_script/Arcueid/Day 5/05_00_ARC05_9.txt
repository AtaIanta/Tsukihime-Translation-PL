"――――"
The cold airs cuts at my skin.
My body temperature is dropping.
Merely existing in this place is difficult.
My brain begins to creak, as if pressurized inside my skull. 
<Page2>
I anticipate the outcome of the next two minutes as my heart struggles, feeling ready to burst.
<Page3>
Corpses swarm toward Arcueid. 
A procession reminiscent of midsummer in the midst of this extreme cold.
Under the blazing sun, they are like ants gathering on sugar.
Arcueid will be killed.  
Those corpses will tear her limb from limb and offer her up, just as I/you did.
<Page4>
And I will watch it from a safe distance.
Just like that... #Just like that？
<Page5>
"...Impossible."
That thing is a disaster in the form of a human being.
I shouldn't have cornered it.
The idea of defeating it was beyond arrogant.
<Page6>
Can't let it kill any more people?
Solve the problem without any more casualties?
How foolish. I had to let that monster go. I should not have confronted it. I needed to wait for it to pass by like a typhoon. If I had done that, at least the city would have been able to burn.
<Page7>
"...but, that's impossible."
Someone who can't do anything. Myself, who chooses to does nothing.
Someone who doesn't even have a weapon. Myself, who has a weapon.
In my pressurized brain, common sense and insanity thrash about.
My mind turns away, trying to escape. I can't stop myself.
It's no use. What can I do against that thing? That woman. This much is enough. It's too much from here on. That woman. All you have to do is run away. Just turn away. That's the way it's going to be. That woman is going to be killed.
<Page8>
I look up to the sky. Frozen buildings surround my vision.
People that died in an instant. They probably didn't even have time to scream.
The scene at the hotel last night. The pleas of the people who were killed for no reason spring to mind.
The figure of the fallen woman. A corpse sloppily drooling on that <woman|flesh>. A spreading river of ice. Despite it all, the vampire is still indifferently observing the death of the city...
<Page9>
"...It's certain."
My skull cracks. In this low temperature, my heart is pumping out blood like a raging bull.
Then, that means...
<Page10>
"...I absolutely, cannot do it."
The fear running down my spine is converted into anger.
I'm defective. A joke. Too immature to be human. #Because. #I don't have the guts or the judgment to stand by and watch this happen...!
<Page11>
I take off my glasses.
As my jaw begins to shudder, I desperately cover my mouth with my left hand to prevent any heat from escaping.
<Page12>
One minute, no, three minutes.
That's all the time I have left. 
It's not a matter of mental strength. Inside that pit, it's the limit for human life. 
<Page13>
"Shit... shit, shit, shit!
What the hell am I doing?!"
<Page14>
I descend the slope, condemning myself. 
It's ridiculous. It's been ridiculous. Really, the whole thing is ridiculous.
<Page15>
You don't want to die, so you run away?
It's the opposite. The reason is exactly the opposite.
It's something that should not be tolerated.
It's something that can't be allowed to go unchecked.
If you run, you will die. Not just you, but this entire city.
<Page16>
Then it's obvious what to do.
If you don't want to die, kill it. Charge in for your life.
Right here, right now, kill it as fast as you can.
<Page17>
Finally, I think I've run out of patience. 
It killed, stole, and survived without a second thought.
As different <organisms|people>, we can't both exist.
Whatever it is, if it's alive, it's my prey.
Right here, I'll end the root of its life...!
<Page18>
I run towards Arcueid.
The corpses are trying to sink their teeth into her body.
<Page19>
The question from earlier comes to mind, "Can you kill them?"
Can you kill something that looks like a person, whether it's human or not?
<Page20>
―――It doesn't matter.
My head just hurts right now.
This is the first time I've exposed my naked eyes for this long.
I've never been this objective in my thinking.
I've never been so manic, looking down the lines of death.
I lock the image of the <corpse|thing> to be destroyed.
Don't touch it. It's an eyesore. Don't let the dead eat the living.
In the first place...
I'm the only creature allowed to prey on that woman.
<Page21>
Cut the lines of the three bodies.
Split each torso into three parts. The corpses are cut like butter and die.
It's that simple. Because their consciousness is focused on Arcueid, they're totally defenseless.
<Page22>
"Wake up! How long have you been asleep?!"
There's no need to touch Arcueid. 
I call out to her as I cut the fourth body. 
<Page23>
"Mmm... Shi.. ki?"
I'm not sure if my call is what brought her back to consciousness, but she weakly opens his eyes.
<Page24>
"What are you doing here? Stop, run away!"
<Page25>
Arcueid begins to sit up, her face contorting as she curls her body.
She regained consciousness. She's still alive. However, the wound has not yet healed.
<Page26>
She can't move from here yet.
She should be the one running away, not me, but I can't let that happen.
<Page27>
"Okay, you're fine. That's good. Cover me if you can."
"You mean you're going in alone? Are you insane!?"
"Who in their right mind would try something like this?
Look, it's like I'm at the bottom of the ocean right now. I only have three minutes, so in that time-"
<Page28>
"In that time. You and I, we're going to kill him and end this.
<Page29>
I leave Arcueid behind and run.
Regripping my knife, I check the distance to Vlov. 
40 meters away.
Six seconds to contact. He hasn't seen me yet.
<Page30>
―――Three seconds.
No time to wait and see. I'm going to finish him off with one blow.
My body's already struggling.
<Page31>
Three minutes until my consciousness and body are shut down by the low temperature.
I have less than a minute at full capacity.
That's enough. I know what I have to do.
I can see the line of death that will "kill" the monster.
<Page32>
Finally, he reacts.
With a sweeping motion, he turns his gaze to intercept me.
The giant spear that skewered Arcueid is gone.
Of course not. He can't be bothered.
<Page33>
To Vlov, I'm no different than the corpses.
An incompetent "thing" that only protects Arcueid.
It's just as insignificant as the weak <humans|creatures> he's been trampling on.
<Page34>
"――――Ha."
That's why I have a chance.
The only thing I can do is take him by surprise.
He's already seen me. I can't attack him from behind.
<Page35>
Yet, I can still take him by surprise.
He doesn't know about my eyes.
He doesn't even consider that a mere human has the means to kill an immortal vampire with a single blow.
<Page36>
Two seconds.
I only have to risk it once, to cross the border between life and death.
I'll duck his first move. That's all I care about.
If I can just get past him, all I have to do is cut that line-
<Page37>
"...!"
The last second.
In the last second, just as I was about to be in range, we both jump back at the same time.
We never even came within a step or a blade of each other.
<Page38>
There are two reasons.
For one, I was mistaken.
I can't get close to him. The cold wind is blowing intensely around him. The closer I get, the slower my body becomes. At my running speed, when I get within two meters of him, I won't be able to take another step and lose consciousness.
The minimum requirement for a surprise attack.
The condition of "reaching the range to kill" cannot be achieved against Vlov.
<Page39>
That's okay. As a matter of fact, I had taken that possibility into consideration.
However, there's another problem.
This one is far more deadly.
<Page40>
"Bastard―――!"
Rage mixed with the headache caused by my eyes.
<Page41>
It's unbelievable. That bastard, he read through everything.
Probably a gut feeling.
A beast's instinct when facing death.
He jumped back without a second's hesitation because he had a sudden intuition that the enemy had the means to kill him, and recognized me as a threat, in a situation with absolutely no evidence...!
<Page42>
"...Why did I retreat...?"
My retreat was a mere two meters.
But his was extraordinary, a thirty meter leap.
I guess that's the "minimum safe zone" for vampires. Honestly, the scale of it makes me laugh.
<Page43>
"...What? What are you...?"
"――――――"
That's my line.
<Page44>
Whatever the case, the situation is bad. The distance between us is unbridgeable.
I admit it's impossible to beat him,
and he sensed that I have a way to kill him.
From here on out, there's no question.
<Page45>
"...Good. Stay back. You can die over there."
It would be a one-sided slaughter from a distance.

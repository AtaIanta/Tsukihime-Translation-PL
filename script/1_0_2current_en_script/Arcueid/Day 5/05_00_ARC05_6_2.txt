<Page1>
I can't go down like this.
The ground below is filled completely with blue flames.
<Page2>
A tall vampire stands at the center.
Vlov Arkhangel.
He stands in the middle of the explosion without a single scratch.
By human standards, he is practically an immortal monster.
And then...
<Page3>
There is a white figure trifling with the man from the front.
The beautiful hunter runs through the garden of flickering flames and debris.
<Page4>
Of course, that white figure belongs to Arcueid.
She leaps across the river of flames and closes upon Vlov.
<Page5>
A crude and deadly weapon is being grasped in Vlov's hand.
It looks like a long sword, but that blade is that of a billhook.
On the other hand, Arcueid is fighting empty-handed.
Using the force of her legs alone, she closes in on Vlov. And then...
<Page6>
She exchanges blows with Vlov's billhook using just her claws, causing the tall figure to retreat......!
<Page7>
There is a single wound on Vlov's arm so deep that his bones can be seen.
It was only visible for an instant. The arm that had been sliced open by Arcueid's claw heals with the blood that is pouring out.
<Page8>
Arcueid said that as long as vampires have blood, they become immortal and carry a large stock of life.
It was exactly as she had said.
In the blink of an eye, a wound that would have killed a normal creature immediately became a thing of the past.
<Page9>
The massive weapon gets swung without hesitation.
Arcueid keeps her distance.
Whenever she strikes a blow, she moves out of range and prepares for the next attack.
<Page10>
Is she being cautious about Vlov's counterattack...... No, that's not it.
That face...... Is she enjoying herself while cornering Vlov......?
<Page11>
"Is being tough to kill the only redeeming feature you have?
The quality of the Twenty Seven Ancestors must have fallen. Are you really going to let me kill you like this without revealing your trump card?"
<Page12>
"―――,―――,―――"
Vlov's breathing becomes erratic.
His morbidly pale face becomes tormented with further painful anguish.
<Page13>
...... Vlov is most definitely an immortal.
But even that has its limits.
It may seem like he is unharmed, but there's no doubt that Arcueid's rapid dive attack inflicted a fatal wound even for him.
<Page14>
It took him all of his effort to regenerate his body.
It's easy to assume that he spent most of his energy trying to revive himself just like when Arcueid was killed by me.
<Page15>
In fact, the same could also be said about Arcueid.
That's the reason why she is keeping her distance after every attack.
She is inviting Vlov to perform one final attack. A counterattack with all his might.
<Page16>
A countless number of collision sounds echoes in the air.
The breathing of Vlov becomes frantic.
"――― No, that's―――"
A sense of unease I cannot describe.
Arcueid has the upper hand. It's clear that Vlov is getting exhausted.
And yet as a bystander, I feel a growing sense of dread in my heart.
<Page17>
That dread comes from the fact that since earlier, Vlov is becoming more immune to Arcueid's claws.
<Page18>
It's also because his swordsmanship...... no, his skill with the billhook is so exceptional that one would not be able to guess it from his appearance.
<Page19>
Furthermore, it's also the fact that he's already able to see through Arcueid's speed and movements completely. And most importantly―――
He still hasn't used that 'flaming hand' of his......!
<Page20>
"GU――――――AAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!"
"―――!"
<Page21>
Vlov sends out a roar.
The flames blaze in response to his mighty roar of rage.
The eternal flames reaches a height of several meters,
breaking the river into dozens of branches.
<Page22>
The underground arena has turned into a forest of fire.
The wall of flames prevented Arcueid from being able to escape.
And from there,
<Page23>
a hand of unparalleled heat is unleashed towards Arcueid, melting the rubble in its path.
<Page24>
"Arcueid―――!"
In one instant.
The tides of battle get turned in one instant.
<Page25>
Arcueid said that she can withstand temperatures of up to 3000ºC.
However, the 'hand' that melted the rubble with ease had a temperature of well over 3000ºC.
<Page26>
That combined with the other reasons for the dread meant that even the ashes would not remain. Without a path of escape, the flames became a tongue that tormented its prey.
The white figure burned away without a trace.
――― That's what would have happened if this was last night.
<Page27>
The flames crack open.
A white skirt flutters in the air.
My sight are fixated on the transformation of her outfit like I had been mesmerized.
<Page28>
I recall her saying something before.
"I have a countermeasure. I will recreate my body beforehand."
<Page29>
The black and white <battle costume|dress> that defies the flames of Vlov.
Did her costume consume those flames, or is her appearance simply the result of her recreated body?
<Page30>
In any case, the flames are unable to affect her now.
The countermeasure by Arcueid was flawless.
As soon as she identified that her opponent was a monster of flame, her victory was assured the moment she escaped from the hotel.
<Page31>
A hand of flame is unleashed.
Arcueid casually thrusts out her left hand.
With a motion similar to that of combing her hair, she disperses the towering walls of flame on all sides.
<Page32>
The wall of flames bowed its heads, submitting to the white dress.
Her golden hair runs like a meteor.
<Page33>
The power of the claws that flew and swung down was beyond anything I had ever seen.
As Vlov retreats helplessly, the second and third claws are unleashed.
<Page34>
An overwhelming difference in ability.
It is no longer a battle.
As soon as the flames were nullified, Vlov became nothing but a prey to be hunted.
Arcueid's claws are precise and uninterrupted as they continue to inflict fatal wounds on Vlov's body.
<Page35>
The only reason why Vlov is still standing is that he probably still has some blood left over.
But that's going to run out at some point. On top of that, there are no more resources here that he can 'extract from a human'.
The only blood that's left remaining is the one that flows within his own body.
Even that will run out after a few more blows.
<Page36>
In other words, bankruptcy.
If the energy needed to revive his body is lost, his body will rightfully revert back to a corpse.
<Page37>
"――― Stop, it―――"
He begs for his life without any pretense.
Just like a spoiled child.
His mastery of the billhook is also lost.
The vampire swings his billhook erratically as if to shake off the fear in front of him. But Arcueid was not about to let that disgraceful opening go by.
<Page38>
"It's cold――― It's cold――― This place is cold―――!"
The vampire jumps as he gives off a scream.
With the last of his blood, Vlov jumps to the back. No, he jumps above.
<Page39>
He jumps from the below ground and towards the surface.
Even a height of 40 meters is not enough to stop a vampire.
It's likely that he was planning to replenish his blood supply on the surface.
<Page40>
The green ivy tangles around his legs.
The ivy that sprouted from beneath the rubble grows at a terrifying speed, grabbing Vlov's feet and pulling him back into the debris floor.
<Page41>
"A―――AA, AAAA―――!"
A river of flame appears at Vlov's feet once again.
Surrounded by a fire that burns only life, the green ivy gets returned to ashes.
However, the shackles do not vanish.
Using the ashes as a nursery, new ivy tangles its way in.
<Page42>
No matter how many times it burns, the shackles cannot be removed. It continues to loops like a phoenix.
That's right. If vampires are considered immortal, then the workings of nature are also an eternal, infinite cycle.
<Page43>
That ivy is a manifestation of that. The only way to escape is with a fire that burns this entire planet to the core.
But for Vlov――― No, for a 'curse' of a vampire like that, her mere breath is more than enough to extinguish it.....!
<Page44>
――― Arcueid runs.
From the intensity of her stance, I can tell that this is the final blow.
<Page45>
All of Vlov's counterattacks were destroyed.
With this, she decides that this is the end of the battle.
I come to the same conclusion.
There is no need to wait for my assistance. At this rate, Arcueid will crush Vlov into pieces.
<Page46>
...... And yet.
And yet I can't help but feel a bad premonition.
Something is wrong.
His agony and his breathing tells himself that it is not so.
<Page47>
Vlov's expression and pain are now morbid.
The world where he is alone is different inside that scorching heat.
A white breath as if it was from a polar opposite world.
<Page48>
...... I know those kinds of eyes.
Obsession and defense mechanisms.
He is both the perpetrator and the victim.
That's why―――
―――――― we are definitely making a fatal error.
<Page49>
"You idiot...... What the hell am I thinking......!?"
Arcueid's victory is inevitable.
There is no way I am going to intefere at a time like this.
<Page50>
I don't have to do anything.
There's no need for me to go out of my way and enter that hellscape.
Even as I say that, I―――
C:>I'll have to watch as the battle goes.
C:>I stop Arcueid.

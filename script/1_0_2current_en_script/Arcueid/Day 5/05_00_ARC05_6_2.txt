<Page1>
I can't go down this way.
The underground is overflowing with blue flames.
<Page2>
A tall vampire is standing at the center.
Vlov Arkhangel.
He is right in the middle of that bombing yet he doesn't have a single scratch on him.
By human standards, he is an almost immortal monster.
And,
<Page3>
There is a white shadow tossing and turning around.
A beautiful hunter runs through the garden of flickering flames and debris.
<Page4>
Obviously, the White Shadow is Arcueid.
She leaps across the river of flames and flies into Vlov.
<Page5>
There is a brutal weapon in Vlov's hand.
It looks like a long sword but that blade is that of a machete.
On the other hand, Arcueid is just using her claws.
With her legs alone she closes in on Vlov, and
<Page6>
Uses her claws to strike against Vlov's machete and forces him to retreat..!
<Page7>
Vlov has one scar on his arm that is visible to the bone.
It was visible only for a moment. The arm that has been sliced open by Arcueid's claw is healing with the blood that is pouring out.
<Page8>
Arcueid said that vampires are immortal as long as they have blood, and have a large stock of life in them.
That's right.
In the blink of an eye, a wound that would have killed a normal creature instantly became a thing of the past.
<Page9>
A thick weapon wielded without fear.
Arcueid does not push too hard.
If she has struck a blow, she keeps her distance and prepares for the next one.
<Page10>
Is that a measure to stop Vlov's counterattack..? No.
That expression... She's having fun while hunting down Vlov.
<Page11>
"Being tough to kill is the only thing you have?
The quality of the Twenty Seven Dead Apostle Ancestors has declined. Are you really going to let me kill you without even showing me your secret tricks?"
<Page12>
"――,――,――"
Vlov's breathing is erratic.
The morbidly pale face is in agonizing pain.
<Page13>
...Vlov really is immortal.
But even that has its limits.
I saw that he was unharmed, but Arcueid's dive bombing must have been fatal even for him.
<Page14>
He regenerated his body but that was the best he could do.
It's easy to assume that he spent most of his strength trying to revive himself just like when Arcueid was killed by me.
<Page15>
In fact, Arcueid sees it that way too.
That's why she's keeping her distance with each blow.
She is inviting Vlov to perform one final blow, a counterattack with all his might.
<Page16>
A number of impact sounds echoed in the air.
Vlov's breathing is going crazy.
"...No, that's..."
I can' t describe this feeling of discomfort.
Arcueid has the advantage. Vlov is clearly exhausted.
And yet, as a bystander, I feel a growing uneasiness in my heart.
<Page17>
Vlov is becoming immune to Arcueid's claws.
<Page18>
His swordsmanship...and his machete skills are so exceptional that one would never guess it from his appearance.
<Page19>
It's the fact that he's already completely seen through Arcueid's speed and movements and more importantly, well...
He hasn't even pulled out his "flaming hands" yet...!
<Page20>
"GU-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!"
"...!"
<Page21>
Vlov howls.
The flame burns in response to his powerful howl.
The blazing fire reaches a height of several meters.
The stream of fire branches into dozens.
<Page22>
The underground arena has turned into a fire forest.
Blocked by a wall of flames, Arcueid is unable to escape to the left or right.
And then,
<Page23>
As the rubble melts, a hand of unparalleled heat is unleashed on Arcueid.
<Page24>
"Arcueid――!"
One instant.
The tide of the battle turn around in one instant.
<Page25>
Arcueid said that she can withstand up to 3000º Celsius.
However, the temperature of the "hand" that easily melts the rubble is way over 3000º Celsius.
<Page26>
Three of them are piled on top of each other. Even the ashes would not survive. There is no escape, and the flames become a tongue that licks its prey.
The white shadow burns away without a trace.
―――That's if it happened last night.
<Page27>
The flames crack open.
And a white skirt flutters.
The transformation of her outfit has my eyes glued to her as I'm mesmerized.
<Page28>
And then she says.
"I'm ready for this. I'm going to rebuild my body in advance."
<Page29>
The black and white battle dress that defies Vlov's flames.
Is that costume swallowing the flames, or is it just the result of a physical makeover that makes her look like that?
<Page30>
Regardless, the flames can't get through to her now.
Arcueid's measures are perfect.
As soon as she found out that her opponent was a fire monster and she escaped from that hotel, her victory was assured.
<Page31>
A hand of flame is unleashed.
Arcueid thrusts out her left hand carelessly.
With a hair-raising motion, she disperses the towering walls of flame on both sides.
<Page32>
A wall of flame hangs its head, submitting to the white dress.
Her golden hair runs like a meteor.
<Page33>
The power of the claws that flies and swings down is beyond anything I have seen before.
As Vlov retreats helplessly, the second and third claws are unleashed.
<Page34>
An overwhelming difference in performance.
It's no longer a battle.
As soon as the flames are nullified, Vlov becomes a prey to be hunted.
Arcueid's claws are precise and uninterrupted as they continue to inflict fatal wounds on Vlov's body.
<Page35>
The reason why Vlov is able to keep going is probably because he still has more blood left.
It's going to run out at some point. And besides there are no more resources to be exploited here.
The only blood that remains is that which flows into his own body.
It will be over in a few more blows.
<Page36>
In other words, death.
If the energy needed to revive the body is lost, it will become a corpse.
<Page37>
"...st...op..."
Begging for life without any pretense.
He's like a whining child.
He also lost his mastery of the machete.
The vampire swings the machete in a futile attempt to shake off his immediate fear but Arcueid doesn't miss the opportunity.
<Page38>
"Cold... cold... it is cold here...!"
The vampire jumps as he screams.
With the last of his blood, Vlov jumps backwards. No, he jumps above.
<Page39>
Jumps from the underground to the surface.
Even a height of 40 meters is not enough to stop a vampire.
Probably to replenish his blood supply on the surface.
<Page40>
The green ivy twines around its legs.
The ivy that sprouts from beneath the rubble grows at a tremendous rate, grabbing Vlov's feet and pulling him back into the debris.
<Page41>
"A....A, A....!"
A river of flame appears at Vlov's feet again.
Wrapped in a fire that burns only life, the green ivy returns to ashes.
But the shackles does not go away.
Using the ashes as a nursery, new ivy tangles its way in.
<Page42>
No matter how many times it burns, the binding cannot be broken. It loops like a phoenix.
Yes. If vampires are immortal, then the workings of nature are an eternal, infinite cycle too.
<Page43>
That ivy is like a crystallization. The only way to escape is with a fire that burns this planet to the core.
For Vlov, no... for the 'curse' of a vampire of merely that level, extinguishing her breath is just so, so...!
<Page44>
...Arcueid runs.
From the intensity of her posture, I can see that it's the final blow.
<Page45>
All of Vlov's counterattacks were destroyed.
She decids that this is the end of the story.
I agree with this.
There's no need to wait for Tohno Shiki's help. At this point, Arcueid will destroy Vlov.
<Page46>
...But still.
I can't help but feel a sting in my heart.
There's something wrong.
But his agony and his breathing is telling me that it is not so.
<Page47>
Vlov's expression and pain are now almost morbid.
The world is different for one person in that scorching heat.
A white breath as if they were in a opposite worlds.
<Page48>
...I know that kind of eyes.
Obsession and defense instincts.
He is both the perpetrator and the victim.
That's why...
...Wait! We are making a huge mistake.
<Page49>
"Idiot.... What am I thinking...?!"
Arcueid's victory is inevitable.
There was no way I was going to interfere with that at this moment.
<Page50>
I don't have to do anything.
There's no need for me to go out of my way to get into that hell.
Even if I'm aware of this, I...
C:>I'll have to watch as the battle goes.
C:>I stop Arcueid.

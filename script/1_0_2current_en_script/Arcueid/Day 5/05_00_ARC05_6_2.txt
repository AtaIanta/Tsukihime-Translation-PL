<Page1>
I can't get off this thing.
The basement is filled with blue flames.
<Page2>
A tall vampire stands in the center of it.
Vlov Arkhangel.
I was right in the middle of that bombing, and I didn't get a scratch.
By human standards, he was an almost immortal monster.
And with that,
<Page3>
There is a white shadow tossing and turning around.
A beautiful hunter runs through a garden of flickering flames and rubble.
<Page4>
Obviously, the White Shadow is Arcueid.
She leaps across the river of flames, jolts towards Vlov.
<Page5>
There was a rugged weapon in Vlov's hand.
It looks like a long sword, but that blade is from a machete.
On the other hand, Arcueid is using karate.
With the speed of her legs alone, she closed in on Vlov, and
<Page6>
She uses only her claws to strike against Vlov's machete, making the tall man backing off...!
<Page7>
Vlov has one scar on his arm that is visible to the bone.
It was only for a moment. The arm that had been sliced open by Arcueid's claws was healing with the blood that was pouring out.
<Page8>
Vampires are immortal as long as they have blood and a large stock of life, Arcueid had said.
That's exactly right.
In the blink of an eye, a wound that would have killed a normal creature instantly becomes something forgetable.
<Page9>
A thick weapon wielded without fear.
Arcueid doesn't go deep enough.
If someone strikes a hit, you must keep your distance and prepare for the next one.
<Page10>
It was a measure against Vlov's counterattack... No, it wasn't.
That expression... Vlov is enjoying hunting her down.
<Page11>
"Being tough to kill is the only thing you have?
The quality of the Twenty Seven Dead Apostle Ancestors has declined. Are you really going to let me kill you without even showing me your secret tricks?"
<Page12>
". . ."
Vlov's breathing is erratic.
The morbidly pale face turns more into an agonizing pain.
<Page13>
...Vlov really is immortal.
But even that has its limits.
I saw that he was unharmed, but Arcueid's dive bombing must have been fatal to him.
<Page14>
His body regenerated, but that was the best it could do.
It's easy to assume that he spent most of his strength trying to revive himself just like when Arcueid was killed by me.
<Page15>
The truth is, Arcueid seem like that too.
That's why each ones keeps their distance with every blow.
She is inviting Vlov's to perform one final blow, a full-bodied counterattack.
<Page16>
The sound of impact echoed over and over again.
Vlov's breathing is going out of control.
"... No, this is..."
An inexplicable feeling of discomfort.
Arcueid has the advantage. Vlov is obviously tired.
Still, as a bystander, I feel a growing uneasiness in my heart.
<Page17>
This is a situation where Vlov is no longer getting hit by Arcueid's claws from earlier,
<Page18>
His swordsmanship... No, his machete skills are so superior that it is hard to deduce from his appearance,
<Page19>
It's because he's already completely seen through Alcade's speed and movements, and more importantly, so---
He hasn't even pulled out his "flaming hands" yet...!
<Page20>
""GU-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!""
"...!"
<Page21>
Vlov howled.
The flame burns in response to his powerful howl.
The blazing fire reached a height of several meters.
The stream of fire branches into dozens of pyres.
<Page22>
The underground coliseum has turned into a fire forest.
The wall of flames prevented Arcueid from escaping to the left or right.
And then,
<Page23>
As the rubble melted away, am unprecedented hot hand reached Arcueid.
<Page24>
"Arcueid...!"
One instant.
The tide of the battle had turned in one instant.
<Page25>
Arcueid said that she could withstand to 3000º Celsius.
However, the temperature of the "hand" that easily melted the rubble was way over 3000ºCelsius.
<Page26>
Three of them were piled on top of each other. It was so hot that not even ashes would remain. There was no escape, and the flames became a licking tongue, licking up its prey.
The white shadow burned away without a trace.
...If that's what happened last night.
<Page27>
The flames cracked.
The white skirt fluttered.
The visual transformation of her was motionless as if she was fascinated.
<Page28>
And then she said.
"I'm ready for this. I'm going to rebuild my body in advance."
<Page29>
The black and white battle dress that challenges Vlov's flames.
Will that costume engulf the flames, or is it just the result of a body rebuild that makes her look like that?
<Page30>
Regardless, the flames can't get through to her now.
Arcueid's measures are perfect.
At the moment she found out that her opponent was a fire monster and escaped from that hotel, her victory was assured.
<Page31>
A hand of flame is unleashed.
Arcueid's left hand is thrust out carelessly.
With a sweeping motion of her hair, she dispersed out the towering walls of flame on either side.
<Page32>
A wall of flame that hangs its top in submission to the white dress
Her golden hair ran like a meteor.
<Page33>
The power of the claws that flew and swung down was beyond anything I had ever seen before.
As Vlov retreated reluctanctly, the second and third claws were unleashed.
<Page34>
This was a overwhelming performance difference.
It wasn't a fight anymore.
When the flames were nullified, Vlov became the prey of this hunt.
Arcueid's claws were precise and uninterrupted as they continued to inflict fatal wounds on Vlov's body.
<Page35>
The reason why Vlov is able to keep going is probably because he still has more blood left.
It's going to run out at some point. And besides "there are no more resources to be exploited here.
The only blood that remains is that which flows into his own body.
It will be over in a few more blows.
<Page36>
 In other words, running out of blood.
If the heat to revive him is lost, he will finally become just a corpse.
<Page37>
"...st...op..."
Begging for life without second intentions.
He's like a spoiled child.
He also lost his mastery of the machete.
The vampire wielded the machete in a reckless form as if to shake off the fear in front of him. The vampire swung his machete in a recklessly to get rid off the fear in front of him, but Arcueid didn't miss the opportunity.
<Page38>
"Cold... Cold... it's cold here...!"
The vampire jumped as he screamed.
With the last of his blood, Vlov jumped backwards. No, he jumped above.
<Page39>
Jumped from the underground to the surface.
Even a height of 40 meters is not enough to stop a vampire.
Probably to replenish his blood supply on the surface.
<Page40>
The green ivy twines around its legs.
The ivy that sprouted from beneath the rubble grew at a tremendous rate, grabbing Vlov's feet and pulling him back to the rubble ground.
<Page41>
"A....A,A....!"
A pyre of flame appears at Vlov's feet again.
Wrapped in a fire that burned only life, the green ivy returned to ashes.
But the shackles did not go away.
Using the ashes as a seedbed, new ivy will become entangled.
<Page42>
No matter how many times it burns, the binding cannot be unraveled. It loops like a phoenix.
That's right. If vampires are immortal, then the workings of nature are an eternal infinite cycle.
<Page43>
That ivy is like a crystal. You need fire to burn the whole planet to the ground to escape.
Vlov's skill... No, even with that vampire's level of "spell" it's very, very much ... impossible to extinguish with its breath!
<Page44>
... Arcueid runs.
From the intensity of her posture, I could see that it was the final blow.
<Page45>
Every Vlov's counterattack was destroyed.
She decided that this was the end of the matter.
I agree with this.
There's no need to wait for Tohno Shiki's help. At this point, Arcueid will destroy Vlov.
<Page46>
... But still.
But still, I can't help but feel a sting in my heart.
There's something wrong.
His torment and breathing was telling me that it was not the case.
<Page47>
Vlov's expression and pain were now morbid.
And in the middle of that scorching heat, on-ly-one-per-son-in-the-world-is-di-ffe-rent.
A white breath as if they were in opposite worlds.
<Page48>
...I recognize that kind of eyes.
Obsession and defense instincts.
He is both the perpetrator and the victim.
That's why...
...Wait! We are doing a fatal mistake.
<Page49>
"Idiot.... What am I thinking...?!"
Arcueid's victory is inevitable.
There was no way I was going to interfere with that at this moment.
<Page50>
I don't have to do anything.
There's no need for me to go out of my way to get into that hell.
Even if I'm aware of this, I...
C:>I'll have to watch as the battle goes.
C:>I called Arcueid to stop.

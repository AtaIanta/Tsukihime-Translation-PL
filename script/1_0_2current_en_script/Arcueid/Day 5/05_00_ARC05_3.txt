"I see. In that case, I won't say anything.
I'm glad that you decided to fight with me. After all, we can easily 'kill' Vlov in one blow with you around."
<Page2>
"... No, surely that's not possible.
I can't even get close to him with how hot his surroundings are.
And besides, how are we going to find him?"
<Page3>
"'Find him'... you really are extreme, aren't you? To think that you would immediately go on the offensive after deciding not to run away."
"T-Those are just my first thoughts! I don't want to hear that from a personification of extremism like you."
<Page4>
"I'm just more focused on efficiency.
... Well, whatever. Just so you know, it's going to be a war of attrition from here on out.
The most reliable strategy is to run until my strength returns to normal.
After three days, my strength will be restored to about 30% of its original level. With that much power, I'll be able to defeat Vlov on my own."
<Page5>
"Three days...? But then..."
"Yeah. During those three days, Vlov will be on the loose. He will go underground and use humans to replenish his blood supply... No, that's not all. From the looks of him, he might go out and roam the streets at night.
He's not in his right mind after all. Maybe he doesn't understand the theory that the church will go after him if he doesn't hide his presence."
<Page6>
"That's no good. That guy is a monster that spreads his flames just by existing! There's no way we can ignore him even for a day!"
<Page7>
"Then we have no choice but to find and kill Vlov during the day.
But I'm against it. I have a rough idea of where he is, but there's nothing more cautious than a sleeping Dead Apostle. There's a high chance that we'll get killed instead as a result."
<Page8>
"No way. You have a good idea of where he is, but you're just gonna let him go...?"
"Yeah. I told you before, no matter how many humans fall prey to Vlov, none of it is my concern."
<Page9>
... I'm speechless.
I understand where Arcueid is coming from.
Safety measures... No, if I want to be certain, I should wait for Arcueid to recover from her wounds and regain her strength.
<Page10>
... But as a result, the more time that we waste here, the more victims there will be.
I'm going to――――
C:>...Find Vlov now.
C:>...Stay here until nightfall, at least.

<Page1>
It's a projectile.
No, it's more like a bullet.
Being cautious, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm his weapon of death.
<Page2>
Now it's just a matter of how to shoot it.
It's simple. If my legs can't get me there, I'll have to rely on something else: ......!
<Page3>
I run towards Arcueid in the rear.
"Shiki---!"
I hear the sound of ice cracking on my back.
The claw-shaped wind pressure generated by Arcueid seems to be accurate not only within her reach, but also at this distance.
<Page4>
"why the hell did come over here? You're only going to get one chance!"
<Page5>
It's better for the Vlov to have his prey in a single spot.
I know that.
<Page6>
"I know, but this is the only way!
Did you throw the rubble?
Do that to me!"
"Huh?
<Page7>
Or more precisely, 'do it to me'.
The debris you just threw was a piece of ground nearly three meters high.
If I can throw it away at that speed, it's many times faster than at what I can run!
<Page8>
"I understand what you're saying!
But won't you get knocked off in the process?"
"Normally, yes! But you can tie me together with it!
"Yes, I can."
<Page9>
Arcueid is hesitant, but this is the only way.
I want you to tie me to a piece of rubble big enough for me to hide behind, and then throw it towards Vlov.
Of course, if you aim directly at Vlov, I'll be shot down.
If possible, I'd like to throw three rounds of debris.
<Page10>
The first shot should be aimed directly at Vlov,
The second shot should deliberately miss and land behind Vlov,
The third shot is going to be aimed at Vlov again.
<Page11>
I'll hide in the second shot.
Just before falling to the ground, I'll cut the 'lines' running through the rubble and get behind Vlov within two seconds....!
<Page12>
"Are you sure you want to do that?
If we miss the timing, you'll crash into a dead body?"
"If we miss. The only way would be to try and kill him while remaining unharmed."
<Page13>
The ice spear's sweep is gaining momentum.
We can't spend any more time here.
<Page14>
"---Got it. So I'm just going to remove the rubble along with Shiki on it while aiming for Vlov?"
"Yeah. I'll just walk right past him."
<Page15>
I get behind Arcueid.
Pulling myself up against a larger piece of debris. I put my body against the face of the rock and get into a push-up position.
<Page16>
Green ivy emerges from Arcueid's fingertips, tying me to the rubble.
Both of my legs and my left hand are pinned to the rubble. Only my right hand, holding the knife, is free.
<Page17>
"Fifty meters to Vlov,
That's what it looked like earlier..."
<Page18>
Arcueid uses both hands to lift up the decoy rubble and the rubble I'm hiding behind,
"Yeah, hold on for four seconds!
<Page19>
A ton of rock flies through the air.
3 seconds later.
As if twisting the stall caused by air resistance, the first throw flew towards Vlov's head,
Just before it hit, it was shattered by the ice spear.
<Page20>
However, it did not end in vain.
Although it was shattered, some of the fragments still hit Vlov's body.
Even though it didn't do any damage, it was still able to chip away at his consciousness.
<Page21>
In the meantime, the debris carrying me passed right by him.
<Page22>
I cut through the rubble.
Inertia stops.
My limbs are free.
I stuck to the ground like a lizard.
My body heat dissipates and my blood freezes in this instant.
<Page23>
"---Huh."
I can see Vlov's back.
Four meters away. I can just barely reach him, but it's not impossible.
<Page24>
Arcueid's third throw is stopping Vlov's movement.
One second has passed. One meter to go.
Two more steps and I'll reach the line that will end his life.
<Page25>
But...
It was impossible for a human to cross those two steps.
<Page26>
"------"
There was no room to scream,
The sensation of pain was already frozen.
Was he aware of me, or was it just an automatic interception?
There were countless thorns of ice growing around Vlov, welcoming the attacker.
<Page27>
""---You foolishly picked the safe route.""
A disappointed voice said.
Safety. Safety. Oh Well, safety, eh.
I had thought of a way to save myself.
Arcueid cared about me, so she held back a second, slower than the other throws.
...... failed. That's not even close to what it is.
This isn't even a surprise attack.
<Page28>
I don't need to wait to bleed to death.
The cold wave that had struck vlov and my own disappointment in myself had brought my heart to a complete halt.

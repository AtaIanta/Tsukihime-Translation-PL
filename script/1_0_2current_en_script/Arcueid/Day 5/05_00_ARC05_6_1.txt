The location of the enemy is clear.
Down here is Vlov who must be defeated.
And Arcueid is here as well, whom I promised to fight with.
<Page2>
The battle between the two has already begun.
...All right. My role here is not to fight. I'm here to finish the job.
When Arcueid captures Vlov, I will get close to him and cut his 'line'.
And for that...
<Page3>
"Yes, this is no time to be scared...!
I slide down the slope of rubble and descend into the sunken ground.
I immediately cover my mouth and nose with one hand.
It's not intentional, but a reflexive action to save my life.
<Page4>
"---"
I can't breathe.
There is oxygen. I know from the hotel fight that these blue flames are a curse, not an actual combustion of matter.
<Page5>
But it's still hot, Just breathing normally will cause my lungs to burn to death from the hot air.
<Page6>
A vampire in white and a vampire in black can be seen ahead.
Their swords and claws clash.
In this high temperature, Arcueid is attacking Vlov without any fear.
<Page7>
As far as I can see, Arcueid has the upper hand.
If things continue as they are, she'll capture Vlov as planned.
The problem is...
<Page8>
"---------"
It's just a question of how long my body can hold out.
My body #is already #starting to burn.
<Page9>
But strangely, I don't feel any pain.
I don't need to take a breath to know what's going on.
With the knife in my hand, I continue to wait for that moment to defeat Vlov.
Like a sprinter waiting for the start signal.
Or maybe like a ghost that will never move again.
<Page10>
Keep waiting.
Keep waiting.
Keep waiting.
Even as my eyeballs dry up, smolder, and turn to ashes, I wait.
The moment never comes.
As if I would never realize that I'm nothing more than a burned film.

<Page1>
His chest is pierced. 
He bleeds profusely. 
It is as if a plug of the bathtub of blood has been pulled out. 
<Page2>
The burning delusion ends.
Stepping over the last boundary. 
And then. 
With a scream that rips through the world, the true face of the vampire appears. 
<Page3>
The atmosphere creaks. 
The atomic activity switches from fast to slow. 
Electrons with nowhere left to go react as they are repel from the solidified ultracold rift.
<Page4>
The blue flames that covered the surface of the earth are not flames. 
That is a kind of heat lost from the earth, similar to vaporization heat. 
<Page5>
"――Oh....really." 
Cold-blooded arms are held up. 
The outstretched palms of his hands, as if craving warmth and heat.
<Page6>
"This place is cold."
The entire body of the white beauty gets swallowed in it.
<Page7>
"――――――Wha?" 
Instead of the change in temperature it is like the world itself has changed.
<Page8>
The river of ice that ran from Vlov not only blows away Arcueid, but also the city behind her. 
<Page9>
It doesn't take more than 2 seconds. 
The glacier reaches the buildings on the ground and freezes everything in an instant. 
......What if, 
There were still people in that building who didn't manage to evacuate yet, he must have frozen all those people, stolen all the heat from them. 
<Page10>
It's impossible, I thought, shivering at the sight before me. 
I'm terrified of what will happen next. 
It's just a coincidence that I'm still alive 
If my location was in the same direction as Arcueid's, I would have been frozen alive by now. 
<Page11>
The river of flames that spread out earlier were slow. 
The people were running away faster than the fire was spreading. 
But this fire of ice ends everything in an instant.
The range is small, and the cold wave crawls on the ground, but if it touches you, it will kill you before you can escape. 
<Page12>
If he comes on the surface, whatever is in front of him will die helplessly...! 
<Page13>
"―――Arcueid. 
Yes, Arcueid is at...!?" 
<Page14>
I cling to my last hope. 
She's the only one who can stop this monster. 
<Page15>
"There she is..." 
In the middle of a river of ice, there is Arcueid. 
Thank goodness...come to think about it. She's pretty sturdy too. 
Standing there in that cold ice without even a scratch on her...! 
<Page16>
"...So that's what it's all about. 
You weren't insane, you were running from your sanity." 
<Page17>
"Even a third-rate mortal can defeat a star as long as he has the principle, huh? 
Thanks to you I'm awake, Vlov Arkhangel." 
<Page18>
Arcueid dispels the ice. 
Vlov stares at her coldly. 
Not with the sickly eyes of the past, but those that precisely observe their prey, like a hunter in the snowfield. 
<Page19>
"We're talking about the one that woke up, then that would be me... 
How dare you take so much warmth away from me." 
<Page20>
It was a voice like a blade, filled only with hatred. 
The vampire's fighting spirit have not faded. 
...No. 
In other words, for the first time in his life, he was ready to fight. 
<Page21>
"Yes. Then accept your good fortune, Vlov. Normally, I would have finished you before you woke up. It was the hateful murderer who saved you. Well, that's only for a short time now." 
<Page22>
"..........indeed. 
What I've heard of you, and what you are now, are far apart. 
...Apparently, I picked up a lucky break here."
<Page23>
"That's what it's all about. 
Both sides are in a state of turmoil, with only the final blow left to deliver. If one of them sets it off, one of them will just disappear. 
But first, I'll take the least you can do." 
<Page24>
"―――Answer me, my slaves of dwarf cattle. 
The testimony of the ancestor. The root of the disease. Its cave like a whirlpool. 
It's an illegitimate child with a new principle. 
What does blood mean to you?" 
<Page25>
It was a stern voice, not in keeping with the occasion. 
Arcueid's question can be taken as a reprimand. 
Vlov's eyes widen in surprise, then 
<Page26>
"Answering with respect. 
For me, blood is warmth itself. 
The heat of life. The elixir that heals my frostbite. That which turns my world, my principles.
That's right. Without blood, I'll freeze to death in this cold." 
In a voice that was even respectful, he reveals his identity. 
<Page27>
"I remember...
One who hated, feared, and tried to avoid humans, drifted across an immense sea, and set up a castle. 
One of the twenty-seven ancestors, Zaria Offenbaum. 
I heard that she ruled the land without having any children, even though she had principles that lasted over a thousand years........
So you killed her and took it from her?"
<Page28>
"...Yes. I'm not an heir. I'm just a knight. I was a knight. Eternity is too much for me." 
<Page29>
The vampire's right hand is pointed at his own shadow. 
From the long―――unnaturally long shadows, a huge object emerges. 
<Page30>
"But it was even more unworthy of the head of the family. 
And so I took it. As a knight, I defeated the king and usurped his throne. Now, this principle has become my own personal curse."
"Yes. It's been a short reign." 
<Page31>
"...You're bullish, I'm not sure what to make of this. You are so weak that you can't even materialize your imagination, and yet you want to go toe to toe with me?"
"No need. There is no need to assimilate the world when you're dealing with mere mortals. 
As far as you are concerned... these claws are enough." 
"――――――" 
<Page32>
The edge of the vampire's mouth lifts. 
The neat face turns into that of an ugly beast. 
He laughs at Arcueid's provocation, saying ‘that's right'. 
<Page33>
"The strongest is the one that is constant and unbiased. 
...You are just like that. You have been weakened to this extent, yet you maintain power that is still more powerful than that I have. 
A primordial "one" that can deal with all kinds of curses, all kinds of situations... no ordinary mortal can match it." 
<Page34>
The air is distorted. 
The blue fever of ill thoughts lower the temperature underground. 
<Page35>
Arcueid has no doubts. 
She knew that Vlov's strange weapon is something that can defeat her, but she still charge it head-on. 
And... 
<Page36>
"But you don't know that. 
Her territory is part of the planet but is excluded from the biosphere because it is ‘unfit to live in'. 
No matter how much of a True Ancestor princess you are, can you endure this hell...!?" 
<Page37>
Cold air is spreading around Vlov. 
Arcueid comes to a sudden stop and thrust out her hands as if to protect something. 
The wind blows, screeches, and covers the city in absolute zero. 
And. 
<Page38>
A huge spear of unworldly steel that shatteres her pure white dress. 
<Page39>
...a blizzard that hides one's vision.
My exhaled breath rises, white. 
<Page40>
Arcueid was blown tens of meters away and collapsed on the rubble. 
The dress that have been repelling the flames now shatters. 
She's back to her old self. 
<Page41>
"...Monster. You are still intact after being hit by my spear? 
But..." 
<Page42>
Arcueid lies collapsed and does not get up. 
Without moving an inch, Vlov holds up his right hand as if to signal something. 
The rubble around Vlov crumbles. 
From underneath, several bodies crawl out, groaning. 
<Page43>
"This hunt is now mine. 
Go pick up the woman's body. 
Its adaptability. The all-powerful blood that surpasses all suffering, in my hands." 
<Page44>
At Vlov's command, the corpses walk up to Arcueid. 
<Page45>
The winner is decided. 
Our mission have failed. 
She couldn't contain him with chains anymore. 
Arcueid has been defeated, and the city is engulfed in a cold wave. 
Everything is dying. 
I'm right in front of it, watching the final scene unfold below me...

It's a tow.
That's all there is. I'm quite clever.
Yeah, if we can't get to them, we'll have them come to us.
<Page2>
It's impossible for me to do it alone, but if Arcueid still has that much power left, it might be possible. ......!
<Page3>
 I run towards Arcueid in the rear.
"Shiki―――!"
I hear the sound of ice cracking on my back.
The claw-shaped wind pressure generated by Arcueid seems to be accurate not only within her reach, but also at this distance.
<Page4>
"Why did you come over here, Shiki?
You're looking like you're really good at this...?
"I'll explain later, just do that thing!
The ivy that caught Vlov just now!
<Page5>
The ivy that caught Vlov earlier!
I shout whilst making a gesture of 'I want you to tie Vlov up with ivy'.
<Page6>
"From this distance!? #And, watch out ......!"
"I managed to do it with a lasso!"
"What?I don't know what's going on, but am I supposed to catch it!?
<Page7>
I'm not sure if she can tell how desperate I am or not, but Arcueid held up her hand towards Vlov, not knowing why.
<Page8>
"That's great!That's great, Arcueid!"
"Heh. But what are you going to do now?
<Page9>
"Of course... pull as hard as you can!"
"So, is this what going 'all-out' looks like?"
<Page10>
If Arcueid can throw rubble with that much force, she should be able to pull Vlov at high speeds.
That's much faster than I can run.
<Page11>
The question is, how much stopping power does Vlov have?
There's no way he'd give up the distance advantage. He'll resist Arcueid's pull with full power.
<Page12>
This is a tug of war between two vampires.
The weaker one will be pulled into the other's position...
<Page13>
"―――What?"
 A moment later,50 meters away, the black cloak disappears,
The enemy to be defeated appeared in front of me, faster than I could prepare myself.
<Page14>
There is no safe zone in this place.
It's not that Vlov doesn't like to approach, it's just that he didn't have the strength to move as much like me.
And yet, I've given him a tailwind.
<Page15>
"――――, Ah"
There's a huge foreign object piercing my chest.
I exhaled loudly, for the last time in my life,
<Page16>
""Don't you know even the basics of hunting?
The rope should be put on after you have killed your prey.""
Deeply disappointed, I heard the hunter's voice.
<Page17>
That's right.
He didn't even use his own life, he just jumped to an easy conclusion.
A fitting end for an idiot no better than a stray dog.

It was like a human missile.
Arcueid fell from a height of 80 meters above ground towards Vlov.
<Page2>
No, it was more like she flew.
While in the air, she took aim and angled herself, accelerating like a missile.
<Page3>
Sand and debris spewed up in the air.
The wind whipped up a cloud of dust that swept the area.
The sea of flames that had been spreading across the downtown area was eradicated by that single blow.
<Page4>
The policemen who had surrounded Vlov in the distance were blown away, with most of them becoming out of action. They were divided into two groups; those who became unconscious after suffering a head injury and those who lost their will to fight due to the sudden explosion.
There was no surprise there.
<Page5>
"J-Jesus..."
After the dust had settled, this was the result.
Arcueid's rapid descent not only shattered the area around Vlov, but also a large portion of the downtown area at the northern entrance.
<Page6>
So that's what she meant by "dropping them underground".
The height of the land subsided over 40 meters.
<Page7>
It felt like watching an incredible force of nature. It's grandeur was on the same level as the Amazon jungle or the Niagara Falls.
"Cut me some slack, you idiot----!"
Of course, I'm not praising her in the slightest.
<Page8>
"But damn that was cool. Was that by accident, or was it part of her plan!?"
There were no casualties from what I could see at the rooftop.
The policemen who were outside the blast radius tended to the knocked out officers and withdrew from the site of explosion to escape.
<Page9>
As a result, this entire area was completely deserted.
This--- this method of clearing people out is way over the top...!
<Page10>
"....!"
Was that flame from Vlov just now?
Whether Arcueid had missed or Vlov dodged the attack, either way, Vlov is still alive.
<Page11>
... A monster that wouldn't go down by that single strike.
As if to chase it down,
a white shadow challenged the flame source in the cloud of dust.
<Page12>
"Make sure you find me afterwards---"
Arcueid's words surfaced from the back of my mind.
... I'll think about that stuff later.
Right now, I need to hurry and get to the ground...!
<Page13>
"Hah, hah, hah, ha---!"
I ran down the stairs.
I cut the lock of the door to the rooftop with a knife.
<Page14>
"...Hah, hah, ha---ah."
I run down the stairs while relying on the emergency lights.
... The feeling of resolve I had was disrupted by my erratic breathing.
<Page15>
All I have to do is cut through Vlov's 'line'.
First, Arcueid will battle him and then restrain him with her chains.
And then that's where I come in.
I'll approach him, cut through his lines and dismantle his body.
<Page16>
Arcueid's plunge back then was extraordinary.
So I can say it's possible that Vlov can be pinned down.
However---
<Page17>
"---But, still---"
... Still, Vlov was in good condition.
Would Arcueid's judgement of him be the same even now?
If by some chance her assessment was wrong, Arcueid would be handicapped by her wound.
<Page18>
... In the worst case scenario, I would have to fight Vlov alone---
No, that's not possible.
There was no worst case scenario in our minds. It's not that we didn't think about it, but that there was no reason to think about it at all.
<Page19>
That's because if Arcueid was to be defeated by Vlov, the only choice I would have left is to run away.
<Page20>
"Hah------hah."
I reached the elevator.
I head inside and press the button for the first floor.
There's no more time for hesitation.
This was no time to hesitate in the first place.
I take a deep breath. I check on my condition. I can move properly at the very least.
<Page21>
It was only the fingers holding the knife that were frozen in place, as if they were not part of my body.
<Page22>
"------"
Could this be fear?
Am I afraid of confronting the violence... of confronting that monster?
If that's the case, then it's fine.
It's normal for people to be afraid of that thing. Of facing someone that can kill you just from being near. How could you call yourself human if you didn't feel fear from that?
<Page23>
That's why,
if there is a problem, it would be,
<Page24>
"------"
... That is,
rather than being killed, it is killing that's the main issue.
<Page25>
"Ha-----h"
My breathing speeds up.
My heart is pounding restlessly like it's a different part of my body.
<Page26>
... I reached the first floor.
I fix the grip on my knife and ran to the newly formed explosion site.

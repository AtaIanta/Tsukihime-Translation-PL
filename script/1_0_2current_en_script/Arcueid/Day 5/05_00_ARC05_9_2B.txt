<Page1>
I stoop down in front of Arcueid.
I put my knees and hands on the ground.
<Page2>
An invisible arm runs through the ground.
Arcueid <t|・><r|・><a|・><n|・><s|・><f|・><o|・><r|・><m|・><s|・> <t|・><h|・><e|・> <t|・><e|・><r|・><r|・><a|・><i|・><n|・> into a fine piece of rubble like before―――no, into many smaller pieces at a much greater scale.
<Page3>
It was an upheaval of the earth itself that was reminiscent of an explosion.
The power of an overwhelming number of fragments. If Vlov's cold air is that of a blizzard, then Arcueid's move is that of an earth tsunami.
<Page4>
A flying spear of ice is nothing but a spray in front of this wall of earth and sand.
The mass, 50 meters in height and 7000 tons in weight, surges towards Vlov, ready to swallow him whole.
<Page5>
However, the knight is unmoved by the natural disaster that returned the land.
The massive waves of earth and sand are pushed back by a single thrust of his steel lance.
<Page6>
Vlov must have seen it in the midst of the downpour of debris.
He must have seen Arcueid kneeling from exhaustion after turning over the bedrock with the last of her strength, and that the 'threat' that was most likely encroaching him using the dust as camouflage was nowhere to be seen.
<Page7>
The man regains his former thoughts in front of the towering wave.
No, it was two minutes ago to be exact.
His brain, which should have lost its sanity from the constant barrage of cold waves, strived to function normally ever since that moment―――when he jumped away from the human closing in before him.
<Page8>
"That human has a plan to kill me."
"Although the reason is uncertain, I have no doubt that is the case."
A remnant of a time when he was normal once.
The experience of fighting as a knight cultivated in the dark days of the Middle Ages had broken the curse that ran throughout his body.
The pride of only twenty years or so had defeated the madness of over a thousand years.
<Page9>
He knows very well about the kind of miracle that is.
This is simply a moment. A trick of the imagination before he kills the human. A dream of the afterlife that can never come into existence.
Don't indulge yourself in combat――― Such human-like joy will become frozen in a matter of seconds.
<Page10>
"――――――, Ha."
That is why he cannot help but be inflamed by this turn of events.
The enemy's aim is clear.
The enemy will approach using the dust as a shield.
Cutting is his weapon. This wall is like a door to him. He will cut it open and step into this space.
<Page11>
The man holds up his lance.
By all rights, he knew that he needed to crush the enemy hiding behind the massive wave.
<Page12>
There is no need to respond to the enemy's tactics.
His strategy is to crush it all.
There is still plenty of power left in him.
The man has ten humans' worth of the finest blood in stock.
However―――
<Page13>
"I cannot do that. I cannot consume this soul at the very least."
For him, it was warmth. Blood for the sake of burning that must be preserved for all of eternity.
<Page14>
He didn't mean to look down on the human.
He already understood that thing was an indescribable case.
The man had a feeling that it would be over for him the moment that thing gets close.
But even so, there are some things he couldn't compromise.
<Page15>
"―――Shatter―――!"
In which case he throws half of his remaining strength into his lance, reading that he was being too <l|・><e|・><n|・><i|・><e|・><n|・><t|・>.
<Page16>
The huge wave of debris collides and scatters.
That is not enough. The only thing that was pierced was the thing in front of him.
That was just a blow to ensure his own safety. The enemy could not possibly be hit by such an attack.
He will definitely come. He will appear no matter what the cost.
<Page17>
"But―――"
As sad as it is, that is the limit of humanity.
A human cannot pass through a rain of debris on his own.
He cannot even make use of the support of the Princess of the True Ancestors to his satisfaction.
<Page18>
It will be over once the downpour comes to an end.
As long as he can see his figure, he will never allow such a surprise attack to happen aga―――
<Page19>
"――――――"
The man's eyes widen as the far-off distance comes into perception.
―――Nothing. There isn't a single trace of him anywhere.
<Page20>
Not even a shadow of him running away.
Perhaps he died from the blow of the lance? Impossible. The man rebukes himself for raising such a foolish question.
And above all, a chill of death runs down the man's spine stronger than anything before.
<Page21>
For a mere second, the man's thoughts drifted away from the 'enemy'.
It is obvious that he is drawing near.
If the enemy cannot be located, then there is an error in the hypothesis.
He predicted that this sediment would be used as a shield.
However, if that wasn't used as a shield―――
<Page22>
"――――――Then it must be a road!"
The man looks up to the sky. Towards the enemy against the moonlight.
Over there lies the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, shining blue like an apparition.
<Page23>
The debris that consumed Vlov wasn't the only thing that Arcueid sent flying.
That bedrock was the true objective.
There I was, tied up and flown overhead outside the vampire's vision at the area <u|・><n|・><a|・><f|・><f|・><e|・><c|・><t|・><e|・><d|・> <b|・><y|・> <t|・><h|・><e|・> <u|・><l|・><t|・><r|・><a|・><-|・><l|・><o|・><w|・> <t|・><e|・><m|・><p|・><e|・><r|・><a|・><t|・><u|・><r|・><e|・><s|・>.
<Page24>
The tsunami of earth and sand crashes through 30 meters below the ground.
Me and him. The final blank space between us.
I reevaluate my choices along with their consequences.
<Page25>
If this is successful, I, Tohno Shiki, will lose both his legs.
Even if I were to survive, I wouldn't be able to walk again for the rest of my life.
I imagine that sort of life in great detail.
―――It doesn't matter. For the price of these two seconds, it's more than a satisfying conclusion.
<Page26>
A mere second to locate the enemy.
As much as I respect the insight, one second is far too long.
<Page27>
"Huh? But wouldn't you fall down somewhere along the line?
There's nothing I can do when it comes to that."
"Of course I'm going to fall! That's why―――"
<Page28>
"―――I need you to create a path for me."
<Page29>
The soaring bedrock is assembled like a puzzle.
A hastily constructed path tied by ivy gliding through the air.
Aside from the difference in altitude, both of us are now on the same playing field.
<Page30>
"―――Now then."
I estimate the average chance of survival.
Before I begin, I establish that <o|・><n|・><e|・> <p|・><o|・><i|・><n|・><t|・>.
The route is set.
A one-way road spanning 30 meters in a mere two seconds.
"It's showtime, vampire."
<Page31>
The gliding descent begins.
A one-breath slider approaching death.
<Page32>
I've completely given up on responding to him at this point.
I can only make one decision per second with my current speed of thought.
Within the two seconds before I fall, I focus all my abilities on only two points.
<Page33>
When it comes to a decision, every action I take is surrounded by death.
Even among them, the choices have an especially high concentration of death.
I assume that this is a moment where I won't survive no matter what I do.
<Page34>
I've decided on two minus points.
Anything other than that has a survival rate of probably around 10%. I won't take those into consideration. If it's 10%, then it's fine.
<Page35>
The problem is the zero point.
It is the point of absolute death where I have no choice but to die regardless of my human capabilities.
I'll put all my ability into it and raise that zero to 1%.
<Page36>
I solidify my consciousness in order to cross over these two lethal points.
There is no consciousness left to allocate to any other event.
So now that I've started to descend, I don't have the ability to think about how to respond to him.
<Page37>
But what if there are more than those two minus points?
I do not consider that. I don't have the capacity to go beyond three death points. In that case, victory belongs to him. That would just mean that his abnormality was more than I could imagine.
<Page38>
The ice spears rush towards the falling prey like they were overlapping one after another.
It was like the jaws of a beast. It's terrifying, but it didn't matter.
I didn't know if it was because of my instincts telling me or something.
But I was confident of what was coming, and against that frightening counterattack that should have killed me...
<Page39>
―――Ten meters.
The first <lethal|minus> point.
The sensations of my limbs, the fine-tuning of my muscles, and the sudden braking of my torso and its return.
My downwards trajectory which couldn't be changed originally gets altered after witnessing that angle of fire...!
<Page40>
A lump of iron passes right next to me.
I crossed over the zero percent gamble.
One second left. Victory is mine. He is already out of options.
<Page41>
I've decided that the second minus point is 'that moment'.
I'll deal with the impact of this fall and kill him before my body shatters.
I don't know what will happen after that. I'll just focus my undivided attention on cutting his line.
<Page42>
That's why.
If he makes one more move than I predict...
<Page43>
"――――――"
I won't think. I won't even dodge. Even if he could change that point halfway, for example, I won't treat what I'm doing as useless.
That's why I gave up thinking.
If I was going to die, I would have died the moment I started to glide.
This is fine.
I'm sure if he skewered my brain here, I wouldn't notice it at all.
<Page44>
―――The second point.
The emergency law of minus 100 degrees Celsius stops my entire body.
The instinct to prepare for landing,
and the reasoning to advocate the meaning of life has already been left behind high in the sky.
<Page45>
"Vlov...!"
I transfer the kinetic energy from my thigh to my waist, from my waist to my back muscles, and from my back muscles to the swing of my right hand holding the knife.
It won't stop even if my muscles no longer function.
In other words, I am a killing machine that works through sensitivity alone. The only thing I need to focus is on my brain to capture the lines.
<Page46>
I see a light at the very edge.
The whirling will of atoms. A predetermined lifespan of matter.
A point of death reminiscent of a pit.
<Page47>
My brain which had abandoned all thought understood through instinct.
If lines represent the death of life, then that thing represents the death of existence.
Any immortal or monster that gets killed through that would meet the most repulsive fate in the world none other than the end of the universe.
<Page48>
But I really don't care about such a revelation.
My whole body shakes with a feeling far stronger than that.
<Page49>
A billhook is being held in Vlov's hand. Even after unleashing his giant, deadly lance, this vampire was convinced that I was coming and chose to intercept me even further.
At this stage. Against a foul opponent like me.
<Page50>
"――――――"
This guy is the real deal. I don't know his standards as a vampire. I'm not interested in that. He is simply an extraordinary murderer.
<Page51>
I can't help but hate him.
If he was in his right mind and was not a vampire, he would have been a knight to be envied.
Even if he's a shadow of his former self now.
<Page52>
That weapon will never have a chance to reach me again.
Turning, dodging, and twisting.
My eyes create a line in his center.
<Page53>
In an instant, the atmosphere reverts back to its original temperature.
The cold wave that was far removed from a natural phenomenon disappears along with the man's life.
In the middle of it all,
"―――What, is this?"
The vampire monologues as he sways.
<Page54>
"...I do not know this wound. I cannot remember this loss.
This―――indescribable feeling of the air, is something I lost some time ago."
<Page55>
I don't know what he's talking about,
or which country's language he is speaking in.
But his gentle voice reminds me of a poet celebrating the spring.
<Page56>
"Ah―――I feel no pain, nor do I feel the cold waves.
It is terrifying but familiar.
It is entirely as if I have become a dead man."

".................." 
...... I know. 
If I want to return to a decent life as a human being, I should run away. 
I'm fine with that. It's the best choice for me. 
But... 
<Page2>
But for Arcueid? 
<Page3>
No, it's not about Arcueid, it's about me. 
If I'm here, if I'm involved with Arcueid, I'll definitely meet him. 
<Page4>
He's crazy. 
Before vampires, flames, or anything else, those eyes are out of the ordinary. 
<Page5>
His emotions are dead. 
He is cold in all things. 
So to him it doesn't matter, not about the lives of vampires, let alone the lives of humans, 
There was no way I was going to stand in front of him again. 
I've almost been killed once, and I know that more than anything. 
<Page6>
I refuse. 
So I should say no. 
I don't know what to think, but it's not something I can handle. 
<Page7>
"---Arcueid, I'm ---- 
But am i right about this? 
For example, a going to abandon this woman? 
Because of me. Because of Tohno Shiki, you're abandoning this woman who can't move satisfactorily. 
<Page8>
"---- I'm ----." 
You're running away. 
Do you want to run away from that monster that mercilessly attacked and burned so many people without even showing any interest in them?
You pretend that you didn't see it, that you are the only one who survived, and then you run away without any conscience. 
<Page9>
"-----..." 
The line of death that only I can see. 
I was told by someone important to me that I had these two eyes because there are times when I would really need them. 
<Page10>
Then the answer is obvious.
I can't shake off my doubts and fears, and I don't know what I can do. 
But still...I can tell you what I don't want to do. 
<Page11>
"Shiki?" 
"...... Arcueid. I don't know what you're talking about. 
No matter how different a creature they are, no matter how helpless I am, the responsibility is the same. After all, I've let many people die, and I don't want to let more people die. 
I can't just run away now because of ......." 
<Page12>
I looked up at the ceiling and took a deep breath. 
Fortunately, my resolve was solidified by it. 
<Page13>
"---I'm going to defeat the vampire. #I think that's the responsibility I should take, being the only one who survived in that hotel." 
<Page14>
I reply to myself as if to say. 
Arcueid sighed heavily for once, as if blaming herself.

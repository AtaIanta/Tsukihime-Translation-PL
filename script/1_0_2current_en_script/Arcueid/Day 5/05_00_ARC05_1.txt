The interior of Arcueid's room is not what I expected from a vampire.
...I didn't think about the room at the time, but looking at it like this, it's pretty normal.
<Page2>
There are no bottles filled with human blood,
or strange sculptures.
<Page3>
"There's even a refrigerator and dishes.
What's with this girl?"
<Page4>
Muttering that, I lay Arcueid down on the bed.
Although her body is light, it is not easy to carry her this far.
<Page5>
"...Aah."
I sit down on the floor and take a deep breath.
It's almost seven o'clock in the morning.
<Page6>
"...Right. I should close the curtains."
<Page7>
I spur my tired body to stand up and close the curtains.
After doing what I could, I am finally able to relax.
But as I'm about to sit down, my knees give out and I fall to the floor with a thud.
<Page8>
"...How pathetic. And this is after carrying just one girl."
<Page9>
...Ever since the accident, I've had a hard time recovering from my injuries.
This is not to say that I don't get enough exercise. I've been exercising as much as I could since the Arima house had a dojo.
<Page10>
In any case, if a person doesn't build up their physical strength, even a cold could kill them.
So I'm proud to say that my basic physical strength and motor functions are on par with others. However, there is no way to improve my <endurance|stamina>.
I'm like a track and field athlete who can only sprint, but can't run a marathon.
<Page11>
"...Hah."
I'm so tired that I can't even get up after lying down.
I've been talking to Arcueid all night and haven't had a decent meal in over a day.
It's crazy that I've been keeping up until now.
<Page12>
"...Arcueid's...wounds, will they be ok...?"
I steal a look at the girl laying on the bed.
Her abdomen has stopped bleeding, but I guess I don't need to worry about that, she can come back to life even after she's torn to pieces.
<Page13>
"...What should I do?"
My head is spinning with fever.
I'm so exhausted that I can barely breathe, and yet I'm more concerned about her condition than my own―――
<Page14>
"―――The crash is believed to have been caused by the motorcycle's brake pedal malfunctioning and the motorcycle going down a steep hill with no brakes.
Two people were injured, but fortunately, no one was killed."
<Page15>
"...Did I fall asleep?"
It seems that I fell asleep on the floor.
For some reason, the curtains are open and a sheet covers my body.
<Page16>
It's just past noon.
There's no sign of Arcueid on bed, and the TV is still on, showing uninteresting news.
<Page17>
"Where did she go...?"
I sit up and look around the room.
I can hear someone in the next room....
<Page18>
"...What is she doing moving around with a body like that?"
I get out from under the sheet and stand up.
I have to go to the kitchen right now and check up on her wound.
<Page19>
"Next on the news:
A fire erupted today, early morning, at the Kuramibashi Dome Hotel. There was no internal fire alert, and so staff returning to work at six o'clock in the morning discovered the irregularity inside the hotel, and contacted authorities. Currently, they are continuing to work together with firefighters to combat the flames."
<Page20>
"-----"
My feet stop moving.
I can't help but be glued to the news footage.
<Page21>
"The safety of the 200 people who were staying at the hotel has not been confirmed yet. Firefighters are working at a rapid pace to extinguish the fire, but not a single person has been found inside the hotel―――"
<Page22>
The newscaster read out the information without hesitation.
The screen turns to show the exterior of the hotel where we have just been, and a list of the names of the two hundred guests who were said to be missing.
Neither my name nor Arcueid's are on the list.
<Page23>
"Also, according to the police investigation, some of the walls inside the hotel are damaged, so there is a possibility that this was not a normal fire, but an explosion caused by a structural defect in the hotel―――"
<Page24>
With a click, I turn off the TV.
"―――"
<Page25>
Confirmation of safety―――?
Finding people in need of help―――?
How can you say that when you have that much information?
All the people who were staying at the hotel were engulfed in that unfathomable fire and burned up without a trace.
<Page26>
"――――"
I try to hold back my nausea.
I can't vomit here, thinking back to that tragedy.
Such petty sympathy would set me lower than a filthy pig.
For me, the only one who escaped death in that hotel, I won't allow anything else other than hatred for the one behind it all.
<Page27>
Two hundred people.
Two hundred people were slaughtered single-handedly, unable to even retain their original form.
<Page28>
The face of that vampire comes to my mind.
I don't know what he is.
However, there is no doubt that he is the source of this disaster.
―――Yes.
The only thing I know for sure is that he's someone who can't be left alive.
<Page29>
"――――――"
...Is my heart still numb, I wonder.
M fear is still there.
MY anger is still strong and swirling.
And yet, my thoughts are cold.
<Page30>
...My heart and my brain seem to have become separate.
Just thinking back about that cloaked man makes me want to scream, but the sensation in my fingertips is only getting sharper.
I don't need the extra emotion. I don't need any extra rage.
All I have to do is to simply―――

The interior of Arcueid's room is not what I expected from a vampire.
... I didn't think about the room at the time, but it's pretty normal now that I look at it.
<Page2>
There are no bottles filled with human blood,
nor are there any bizarre sculptures and the like.
<Page3>
"... There's even tableware and a refrigerator.
What's up with this girl?"
<Page4>
I lay Arcueid down on the bed as I grumble.
Although her body was light, it wasn't easy to carry her all the way here.
<Page5>
"... Hah."
I sit down on the floor and take a deep breath.
It's almost seven o'clock in the morning.
<Page6>
"... That's right. I should close the curtains."
<Page7>
I whipped my sluggish body into shape and close the curtains.
After doing what I could, I should finally be able to relax.
But as soon I try to sit down, my knees give out and make me fall to the floor with a thud.
<Page8>
"... How pathetic. To think that I end up like this only after carrying a single girl."
<Page9>
... Ever since the accident, I've had a hard time recovering from my injuries.
This isn't to say that I don't get enough exercise. I've been exercising as much as I could since the Arima house had a dojo.
<Page10>
In any case, a person that doesn't build up their physical strength can be killed even by a simple cold.
So I'm proud to say that my basic physical strength and motor functions are on par with the others. However, there is no way to improve my <endurance|stamina>.
I'm like a track and field athlete who can only do sprints but not a marathon.
<Page11>
"...... Hah."
I'm so tired that I can't even get up.
On top of having talked with Arcueid all night, I haven't had a decent meal in over a day.
It's crazy that I've lasted this long until now.
<Page12>
"... Arcueid... Her wounds, will they be okay...?"
I take a peek at the girl laying on the bed.
Her abdomen has stopped bleeding, and even if she is torn from limb to limb, she can just simply come back to life. So maybe there's no need to be worried after all.
<Page13>
"... What should I do?"
My head is spinning with fever.
I'm so exhausted that I can barely breathe, and yet I'm more concerned about her condition than my own. All I could think was that I caught something like a severe cold―――
<Page14>
"―――The crash is believed to have been caused by an unknown malfunction in the motorcycle's brake pedal, causing it to fall off a steep slope on the road.
Two people were injured, but fortunately, no one was killed."
<Page15>
"... Did I just fall asleep?"
It seems that I fell asleep on the floor.
For some reason, the curtains are open and there is a bedsheet covering my body.
<Page16>
The time is just past noon.
There's no sign of Arcueid on the bed, and the TV is left on showing uninteresting news.
<Page17>
"Where did she go...?"
I sit up and look around the room.
In the room next to me... I feel a person's presence coming from the kitchen.
<Page18>
"... What is she doing, moving around in a state like that?"
I move the sheet away and stand up.
I need to go to the kitchen immediately and check up on her wound.
<Page19>
"And for our next story.
A fire erupted today in the early morning at the Kuramibashi Dome Hotel. Without any alert of the fire from the inside, the staff returning to work at six o'clock in the morning discovered the irregularity inside the hotel and contacted authorities. 
As of now, they are currently working together with firefighters to combat the flames inside the hotel."
<Page20>
"―――――"
My feet stop all of a sudden.
I can't help but to be glued to the news footage.
<Page21>
"The safety of the 200 guests that were staying at the hotel have yet to be confirmed. As of present, the firefighters are working at a rapid pace to extinguish the fire. However, not a single rescue victim has yet to be discovered from inside the hotel―――"
<Page22>
The newscaster reads out the news in an uninterested manner.
The screen changes, showing the exterior of the hotel where we had just been, along with the list of the names of the two hundred missing guests.
Neither mine nor Arcueid's name is on the list.
<Page23>
"In addition, according to the police reports, the damage to parts of the walls within the hotel called to theories that the incident was caused not by a regular fire, but by an explosion due to a structural defect in the hotel―――"
<Page24>
With a click, I turn off the TV.
"―――"
<Page25>
The safety of the guests have yet to be confirmed―――?
Not a single rescue victim has yet to be discovered―――?
How can you say that when you have so much information?
The information that all the people that stayed at the hotel were engulfed in those unfathomable flames and burned without a trace.
<Page26>
"――――"
... I try to hold back my nausea.
I can't vomit here while thinking back to that tragedy.
Receiving pity in this situation would make me worse than even a pig.
As the only one who escaped that hotel with his life intact, I cannot allow myself to feel anything but hatred.
<Page27>
Two hundred people.
Two hundred human beings were slaughtered arbitrarily without being able to even retain their original form.
<Page28>
The face of that vampire comes into mind.
I don't know what kind of person he is.
All I know is that he is the source of this disaster without a doubt.
――― That's right.
The only thing I know for certain is that he is someone who cannot be allowed to be left alive.
<Page29>
"――――――"
... I wonder if my heart is still paralyzed.
The fear continues to persist even now.
My rage continues to swirl with intensity.
And yet, my thoughts are becoming cold.
<Page30>
... It's like my heart and mind have become seperate.
Just thinking about that cloaked man makes me want to scream, yet the sharp sensation in my fingertips continues to grow.
I don't need such useless feelings. I don't need more reason to be angry either.
There is only one thing I must do. And that is to simply cut those―――

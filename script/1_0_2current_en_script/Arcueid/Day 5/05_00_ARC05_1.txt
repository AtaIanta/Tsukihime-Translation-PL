The interior of Arcueid's room is not what I expected from a vampire.
......I didn't think about the room at the time, but looking at it like this, it's pretty normal.
<Page2>
There are no bottles filled with human blood,
or strange sculptures.
<Page3>
"There's even a refrigerator and dishes.
What's with this girl?"
<Page4>
Muttering that, I put Arcueid to bed.
Although her body is light, it was not easy to carry her this far.
<Page5>
"......Aah."
I sit down on the floor and take a deep breath.
It's almost seven o'clock in the morning.
<Page6>
"......Right. I'll have to close the curtains."
<Page7>
I struggle against my lazy body and close the curtains.
I did what I could, and I guess I'm finally relieved of my tension.
But as I was about to sit down, my knees loosen and I fall to the floor with a thud.
<Page8>
"......This is pathetic. And this is after carrying just one girl."
<Page9>
......Ever since the accident, I've had a hard time healing from my injuries.
This is not to say that I don't get enough exercise. I've been exercising as much as I can since Arima house had a dojo.
<Page10>
In any case, if you don't build up your physical strength, even a cold can kill you.
So I'm proud to say that my basic physical strength and motor functions are on par with others. However, there is no way to improve my <endurance|stamina>.
I'm like a track and field athlete who can only sprint, but can't run a marathon.
<Page11>
"............Hah."
I'm so tired that I can't even get up after lying down.
I've been talking to Arcueid all night and haven't had a decent meal in over a day.
It's crazy that I've been keeping up until now.
<Page12>
"......Arcueid's.....wounds, will they be ok?"
I steal a look at the girl laying on the bed.
Her abdomen has stopped bleeding, but I guess I don't need to worry about that, she can come back to life even when she's torn to pieces.
<Page13>
"......What should I do?"
My head is spinning with fever.
I'm so exhausted that I can barely breathe, and yet I'm more concerned about her condition than I am about myself.
<Page14>
"The crash is believed to have been caused by the motorcycle's brake pedal malfunctioning and the motorcycle going down a steep hill with no brakes.
Two people were injured, but fortunately no one was killed."
<Page15>
"......Did I fall asleep?"
It seems that I fell asleep on the floor.
For some reason, the curtains are open and a sheet is pulled over my body.
<Page16>
It's just after noon.
There's no sign of Arcueid in bed, and the TV is still on, showing boring news.
<Page17>
"Where did she go......?"
I sit up and look around the room.
I can hear someone in the next room.......
<Page18>
"......What is she doing moving around with a body like that?"
I get up and take the sheet off.
I have to go to the kitchen right now and see if she's ok.
<Page19>
"The next news is:
Earlier today, a fire broke out at the Kuramibashi Dome Hotel. There was no fire alarm from inside, but at 6:00 AM, a staff member who returned to work found something unusual inside the hotel and called the police.
Currently, firefighters are working with the fire department to extinguish the fire inside the hotel."
<Page20>
"-----"
My feet stop moving.
I can't help it; I'm glued to the news footage.
<Page21>
The safety of the 200 people who were staying at the hotel has not been confirmed yet. Firefighters are working at a rapid pace to extinguish the fire, but not a single person has been found inside the hotel.
<Page22>
The newscaster read out the information without hesitation.
The screen turns to show the exterior of the hotel where we have just been, and a list of the names of the two hundred guests who were said to be missing.
Mine and Arcueid's names are not on it.
<Page23>
"Also, according to the police investigation, some of the walls inside the hotel are damaged, so there is a possibility that this was not a normal fire, but an explosion caused by a structural defect in the hotel.
<Page24>
With a click, I turn off the TV.
"----"
<Page25>
Confirmation of safety----?
Finding people in need of help...?
Why do they know everything so well and not say it out loud?
All the people who were staying at the hotel were engulfed in that unfathomable fire and burned up without a trace.
<Page26>
"....."
I have to bear the nausea
I can't vomit here, thinking back to that tragedy.
Such pity is no better than that of a pig.
I'm not allowed anything other than hate.
<Page27>
Two hundred people.
Two hundred people were slaughtered single-handedly, unable to even retain their original form.
<Page28>
The face of that vampire comes to my mind.
I don't know what he is.
However, there is no doubt that he is the source of the disaster.
---Yes.
The only thing I know for sure is that he's someone who can't be left alive.
<Page29>
"------"
......Is my mind still paralyzed?
The fear is still there.
The anger is still strong and swirling.
And yet, my thoughts are cold.
<Page30>
......The heart and brain seem to have become separate.
Just thinking back about that cloaked man makes me want to scream, but the sensation in my fingertips is only getting sharper.
I don't need the extra emotion. I don't need any extra heat.
All I have to do is to simply...

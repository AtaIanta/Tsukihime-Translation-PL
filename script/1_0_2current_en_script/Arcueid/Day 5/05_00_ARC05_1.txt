The interior of Arcueid's room was not what you would expect from a vampire.
...... I didn't think about the room at the time, but looking at it like this, it's pretty normal.
<Page2>
There are no bottles filled with human blood
or strange sculptures.
<Page3>
"There's even a refrigerator and dishes.
I wonder what's going on here.
<Page4>
I lay Arcueid down on the bed, grumbling.
Although Arcueid's body was light, it was hard work to carry her this far.
<Page5>
"...... Fu."
I sat down on the floor and took a deep breath.
It was almost seven o'clock in the morning.
<Page6>
...... "I see. I'll have to close the curtains.
<Page7>
I whipped my lazy body into shape and closed the curtains.
I did what I could, and the tension must have finally dissipated.
As I was about to sit down, my knees gave out and I fell to the floor with a thud.
<Page8>
"...... This is pathetic. That's what I get for carrying one girl.
<Page9>
...... Ever since the accident, I've had a hard time healing from my injuries.
This is not to say that I don't get enough exercise. I've been exercising as much as I can since Arima's house had a dojo.
<Page10>
In any case, if you don't build up your physical strength, even a cold can kill you.
So I am proud to say that my basic physical strength and motor functions are on par with others. However, there is no way to improve my <endurance|stamina>.
I'm like a track and field athlete who can run short distances, but can't run long distances.
<Page11>
"............ haha
I lay there and couldn't get up.
I've been talking to Arcueid all last night and I haven't had a decent meal in over a day.
It's funny that I've been <i>keeping up<i> until now.
<Page12>
"...... Arcueid ...... wound, are you okay ......?"
I steal a look at the woman laying on the bed.
Her abdomen has stopped bleeding, but I guess I don't need to worry about that, she can come back to life even if she's torn into pieces
<Page13>
"...... I can't do anything.
My head is wobbling with fever.
I'm so exhausted that I can barely breathe, and yet I'm more concerned about her condition than I am about mine.
<Page14>
The crash is believed to have been caused by the motorcycle's brake pedal malfunctioning and the motorcycle going down a steep hill with no brakes.
Two people were injured, but fortunately no one was killed.
<Page15>
"...... Did I fall asleep?
It seems that I fell asleep on the floor.
For some reason, the curtains were open and a sheet was pulled over my body.
<Page16>
The time was just after noon.
There was no sign of Arcueid in bed, and the TV was still on, showing boring news.
<Page17>
"Where is she, ......?"
I sit up and look around the room
I can hear someone in the next room .......
<Page18>
"...... What are you doing moving around with a body like that?
I got up and took the sheet off.
 I have to go to the kitchen right now and see if she's injured.
<Page19>
"Breaking news,
Earlier today, a fire broke out at the Kuramibashi Dome Hotel. There was no fire alarm from inside, and at 6:00 a.m., a staff member returning to work found something unusual in the hotel and called the police.
We are currently working with the fire department to extinguish the fire inside the hotel.
<Page20>
"-----"
I stopped dead in my tracks.
my eyes glued to the news footage.
<Page21>
The safety of the 200 people who were staying at the hotel has not been confirmed yet. Firefighters are working at a rapid pace to extinguish the fire, but not a single person has been found inside the hotel.
<Page22>
The newscaster read out the information without hesitation.
The screen turned to show the exterior of the hotel where we had just been, and a list of the names of the two hundred guests who were said to be missing.
Mine and Arcueid's names were not on it.
<Page23>
"Also, according to the police investigation, some of the walls inside the hotel were damaged, so there is a possibility that this was not a normal fire, but an explosion caused by a structural defect in the hotel.
<Page24>
I turned off the TV with a snap.
"----"
<Page25>
Confirmation of safety ----?
Finding people in need of help...?
Why did he know that much and not say it out loud?
I remembered that all the people staying at the hotel had been engulfed in those mysterious flames and had burned up without a trace.
<Page26>
"tsu....."
I have to bear the nausea
I can't vomit here, thinking back to that tragedy.
Such pity is no better than that of a pig.
I'm not allowed anything other than hate.
<Page27>
Two hundred people.
Two hundred people were unilaterally killed without even being able to retain their original form.
<Page28>
The face of the vampire comes to mind.
I don't know what he is.
I don't know who he is, but I'm pretty sure he's the source.
---Yes.
The only thing I know for sure is that it's something that can't be kept alive.
<Page29>
"------"
...... Is my mind still paralyzed?
The fear is still there.
The anger is still strong and swirling.
And yet, my thoughts are cold.
<Page30>
The ...... heart and brain seem to have become separate.
Just thinking back to that cloaked man makes me want to scream, but the sensations in my fingertips are only getting sharper.
I don't need the extra emotion. I don't need any extra heat.
All I need to do is simply...

"Agh......aaagghh......aaaaaaaaagh!"
I wake up in a great deal of pain.
<Page2>
Deafening agony.
A crashing sound like a piece of metal in a blender.
The screams are out of this world.
Even his people shuddered.
<Page3>
"Aaaaaaah, aaaaaaaah!"
The pain does not disappear from his consciousness, even as he thrashes, flailes, and lashes out at his surroundings.
<Page4>
The skin crackes from his fingertips.
Acid oozes from the core of his bones, melting his body from the inside out.
His heart was necrotic within minutes, and each time it regenerates, it expels the pain again.
<Page5>
The torture never ends as long as you live.
The only way to be released is death.
But even that salvation was lost long ago.
<Page6>
"...a-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah..."
I don't remember what it was that made me let go of death.
and I don't remember when it became so far away.
It's just painful. I'm cold. It hurts. Hot. I'm scared
All I can think of are the animal-like screams.
<Page7>
I think I came to this land in order to chase and kill something.
I left my beloved in my territory, and crossed the sea all the way.
This is my last chance.
This is my last chance to get everything back.
<Page8>
But what kind of time limit was this last chance?
My head is losing its sanity every day.
Or my body, which grows more cursed every day?
Is it to make up for the sins of a distant day?
<Page9>
I can't remember. I've already forgotten so much.
But if it's just to regain my sanity, it is too late.
I've already lost my sanity. I can't return to sanity now.
When I crossed the ocean, most of my accumulated assets were lost. We can no longer return to our homeland. The only way to continue living is to make this country our second domain.
<Page10>
"Ha-aa-aa-aa-aa....."
It doesn't matter. I don't care how it happened.
I just want blood now.
<Page11>
My skin is freezing. My throat is parched. My soul is starving.
I need warm blood as soon as possible.
I want to bathe in human blood as soon as possible.
Where I am and what I am doing is a question of little importance compared to this desire.
<Page12>
Walking in the dark.
I march with the dead in tow.
I crawl out of the vertically moving box and onto the light-filled ground.
At the same time.
The blue flames spread like water eroding.
<Page13>
No animal senses the change, the danger that has begun to die out.
Even when he was enveloped in a blue mist, he ignored the traffic light, wandered into the crosswalk, and collided with a van.
And when the corpses he had brought with him grabbed passersby by by the shoulders without so much as a fight, pushed them down, and began to make squealing noises.
<Page14>
People even shouted in surprise, but none of them ran away as fast as they could.
By the time they realized that it was not just someone else, but an anomaly that was happening to them as well, they had already lost their way.
<Page15>
The wagon that was supposed to have run over the man was ripped apart from the center to the left and right upon impact.
In a minute, the passerby who had been pushed down by the wraiths was left with only a few bites left.
The flames that had already spread throughout the area burned the legs of the fleeing people, turning them into nothing but food to crawl around on.
It was the beginning of Abyssal Screams.
<Page16>
"------why?"
In the midst of it all, he summoned a faint sense of reason.
He squints at the dazzling light.
His thoughts, smeared with pain, begin to spin with a discomfort that exceeds them.
He squints at the glaring light.
<Page17>
"Why is this city so bright?
Filth should be hidden.
Is it the way of this land to show it off?"
<Page18>
In front of us, there is an overflow of flesh.
I would normally be savoring their guts and drinking them up with joy, but I have no desire to do so.
He barks "Even if it is full of humans, can this place really be called a fertile land?"
<Page19>
"There are many humans. There is no shortage of blood."
A blue flame overrides the dead.
and the wraiths are quickly engulfed in the flames, changing the way they are.
The flaming dead are driven by flames.
Their abilities improve, but their bodies burn out in a short time.
<Page20>
"But I am not intrigued by the blood of these pigs."
Physiological disgust multiplies the curse.
Blue flames, burning only with life, fill the asphalt road.
A river of flame begins to flow through the weir.
<Page21>
"Bottom line, it's pointless."
He crushes the flesh seared by the flames and accepts the gushing blood with shame.
It's the equivalent of being bathed in vomit, but it can't be helped.
He cursed himself for his inability to move without being exposed to blood.
"All this glory and prosperity is meaningless to me."
<Page22>
He resumes his march with the burning corpses in tow.
I can't remember what I was chasing.
but I have one thing to do before I remember.
I realize that this is a worthwhile task.
Suffer and die, he laughs.
This shabby city deserves a terrifying end.

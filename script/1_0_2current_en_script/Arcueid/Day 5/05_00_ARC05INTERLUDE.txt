".....Aaagh ......AAAAAAAAGH!"
With that, I wake up in a great deal of pain.
<Page2>
Deafening agony.
The sound of clashes like a metal fragment in a mixer.
An unearthly scream
that makes even my followers tremble in fear.
<Page3>
"Aaa―――aaaah, aaaaaaaah―――!"
The pain does not disappear from his consciousness even as he thrashes, flailes, and lashes out at his surroundings.
<Page4>
The skin gets torn from his fingertips.
Acid oozes from the core of his bones, melting his body from the inside out.
His heart becomes necrotic within minutes, and each time it regenerates, the pain appears along with it.
<Page5>
The torture never ends as long as he lives.
His only way to be released is through death.
But even that salvation was lost long ago.
<Page6>
"A―――ah, aa―――h, gh―――"
I don't remember what it was that made me part ways with death.
I don't remember exactly when death became so far away.
All I know is that this is agonizing. Cold. Painful. Hot. Frightening.
All that remains in my head are these animal-like screams.
<Page7>
If I remember correctly, I came to this land in order to chase something. In order to kill.
I left my beloved mistresses in my territory and crossed the ocean from afar.
This is my last chance.
I made my resolve to take everything back, knowing this was my last chance.
<Page8>
But when exactly did I determine that this was my last chance?
Was it when I lost my sanity with each passing day?
Was it when my body accumulated curses with each passing day?
Or was it when I swore to make up for the crimes committed in the distant past?
<Page9>
I can't recall. I have already forgotten so much.
But if I came here for the purpose of regaining my sanity, then I am far too late.
I have lost my mind long ago. I can't go back to normal after all this time.
When I crossed the ocean, a great number of my accumulated fortunes were washed away. I can no longer return to my homeland. I have no means to survive other than to claim this ground as one of my own.
<Page10>
"Ha―――h, aa, ah, AA――――――!"
It doesn't matter. Those kinds of trivial things don't matter.
The only thing I want now is blood.
<Page11>
My throat is freezing. My skin is dry. My soul is starving.
I need warm blood as soon as possible.
I want to bathe in human blood as soon as possible.
These questions of where I am or what I'm doing are nothing when compared to the desires deep in my heart.
<Page12>
Walking through the darkness.
I march with the dead in tow.
I come out of the vertically moving box and crawl onto ground above, brimming with light.
At the same time.
The blue flames spread like encroaching water.
<Page13>
There wasn't a <creature|human> that sensed the danger that had dyed the land.
Even when the man shrouded in the blue mist wandered into the crosswalk while ignoring the traffic light and collided with the van.
Even when the ghouls that the man took with him effortlessly grabbed the pedestrians' shoulders, pushed them down and started creating those sloppy sounds.
<Page14>
Even when people raised their voice in surprise, none of them ran away with full force.
By the time they realized that it was not just someone else's problem, but an anomaly that affected them all, they had already lost their chance to escape.
<Page15>
The van that was supposed to have run over the man was split into two halves from the center upon impact.
The pedestrians who had been pushed down by the ghouls were turned into mere leftovers in a matter of minutes.
The flames that had already spread throughout the area burned the legs of the fleeing people, turning them into nothing but food to crawl on.
It was the beginning of pandemonium.
<Page16>
"―――――― Why."
The man summons a faint sense of reason in the midst of it all.
The dazzling light makes him squint.
His thoughts that were smeared with pain,
begin to spin with exceeding discomfort.
<Page17>
"Why is this city, as bright as it is?
Filth is something that should be hidden.
Is it the way of this land, to make such a deliberate spectacle?"
<Page18>
An abundance of <fruit|humans> layed before his eyes.
Normally he would rip apart their guts and drain them dry with joy, but that urge did not spring up at all.
The man roars, saying "Even if this place is full of humans, can it really be called a fertile land?"
<Page19>
"The humans are plenty. Blood shall not be an issue."
A blue flame overrides the dead.
The ghouls are quickly engulfed by the flames, transforming their forms.
The blazing dead are driven by flames.
Their abilities improve, but their bodies burn out in a short time.
<Page20>
"But I am not intrigued by the blood of these swine."
The curse continues to get propagated by his visceral disgust.
Blue flames, burning nothing but life, fill the asphalt road.
A sea of flame gushes forth and begins to flow.
<Page21>
"In conclusion, it's meaningless."
The man crushes the fruit that had been seared by the flames and accepts the gushing blood with shame.
Although it is the equivalent of being bathed in vomit, it can't be helped.
The man curses at his own misfortune of not being able to move without bathing himself in such vomit.
"All this radiance, and all this prosperity, mean nothing to me."
<Page22>
The man continues his march, bringing along the burning and crumbling corpses with him.
He does not remember what he was going after,
but until he does, there was only one thing left for him to do.
He comes to the realization that this job is very worthwhile.
"Suffer and die", he laughs.
A gluttonous city like this deserves an unsightly end.

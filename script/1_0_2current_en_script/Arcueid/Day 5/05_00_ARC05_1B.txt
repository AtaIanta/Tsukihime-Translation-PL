<Page1>
"Did you notice that, Shiki?" 
Arcueid poked her head out of the kitchen.
<Page2>
"Mmm. What's with that scary face?"
Arcueid talked to me very naturally and casually.
<Page3>
"N-no. It's nothing. Well.... It's, g-good morning."
<Page4>
"Yes, good morning!
Hmm. It's a rare experience to greet someone in the morning."
<Page5>
"――――――"
The unexpected smile took my breath away.
The thoughts that were creeping me out suddenly disappeared with it.
<Page6>
.... But, I can't calm down just yet!
I got up from the bed because she wasn't there in the first place!
<Page7>
"How's your wound, Arcueid?"
"Wound？# Erm, it's all fine for now."
<Page8>
Arcueid stood there looking comfortable.
She was looking like entirely back to normal, in fact she seemed to have even more energy than me.
<Page9>
"......Is that so. That's a relief―――"
At least. The people close to me are safe.
"......Uh？"
What was I thinking?
Arcueid isn't human.
To forget this basic fact is beyond sleepwalking.
<Page10>
"......But、that's still a good thing, isn't it?
Your wound isn't that big of a deal.
"Huh, What's wrong with you, Shiki? You were calling me a monster just a while ago."
<Page11>
"...... You know? It's not aboout just a while ago, I still think so. But that has nothing to do with this. If you help me, I'll be grateful."
<Page12>
"I helped you?"
<Page13>
Arcueid's eyes widened in surprise.
By the looks of it, she didn't notice it.
<Page14>
"That's right. You're the one who saved me.
.... That's why I'm grateful to you for protecting me all this time. If you hadn't pulled me over, I would have burned to death too."
<Page15>
"Thank you...? Well, I don't mind, you don't have to think this way. The reason why you met Vlov was because of me, and I don't deserve to be thanked by you, Shiki."
<Page16>
"But it's also true that you saved me. You always helped me out and I'm thankful for that.
<Page17>
"... ... If you look at it that way I guess it's true but....
You're wrong, Shiki. If you weren't on the lookout you wouldn't have gone through what you did.
I am the one who poisoned your life. You can hate me, but it's wrong to thank me, isn't it?"
<Page18>
Arcuied is obsessed with the strangest things.
Seriously. Gratitude is a matter of feelings. There's no need for a rational explanation.
<Page19>
"I am not wrong.
You have to take responsibility for your own actions. There was someone who taught me that a long time ago.
No matter what everyone else thinks, you have to settle what you want with your own hands."
<Page20>
So, I don't feel any hatred or resentment towards Arcueid for having been on guard duty.
At most, I would probably blame myself for getting caught up in this mess.
<Page21>
"--I see. The reason I need a shield in the first place is because you killed me.
So there's no need for me to apologize for getting you involved?"
<Page22>
"Yeah, that's what I mean. I deserved it..."
<Page23>
"I suppose you got what you deserved.
Yeah, you were unlucky from the start, weren't you?
If you wanted to kill someone, you could have chosen someone other than me and this wouldn't have happened."
<Page24>
"........You know what?"
The assumption that I might have killed someone other than her in the first place is impossible to make.
<Page25>
The only person I've ever felt that way about, the only person I've ever killed after walking around for no apparent reason, is Arcuied.
In fact, I don't think there's any other person I'd want to...
<Page26>
".......Ah"
"What? Did you forget something?
"No, I guess I just remembered something....... Come to think of it, why did I want to kill you ......?"
<Page27>
Arcueid frowns and looks at me.
It's a natural reaction.
Since I, the perpetrator have no idea why I killed her, how can she know?
<Page28>
"There was no reason for it, right?
Because you are a murderer at heart."
"......What?"
<Page29>
Hold on.
What did this girl say to me just now?
<Page30>
"You were really good at it when you attacked me.
You pressed the bell, and the moment the door opened, You barged in without saying a word.
While I was surprised, the first hit struck my vitals, and then you cut me to pieces...."
<Page31>
"Yep, that ambush was perfect.
It was so perfect that if I could put you on canvas as you were at that moment, you would be a piece of art.
If I was still completely sane, I would take it back to the castle and decorate it.
<Page32>
Arcueid said something strange in a slightly euphoric voice,
But, no, that....
<Page33>
"Tha...."
<Page34>
"But this time, you killed the wrong person.
I don't know how many people you've killed in your life, but when you chose me as your prey, it was time for you to pay your dues.
<Page35>
"Tha..That's.."
<Page36>
" What do you mean by 'Tha..That's..'? And what's with the terrified look on your face?
If you have something to say, why don't you say it clearly? There's nothing to hold back between you and me now, is there?"
<Page37>
Right.
After nodding I signaled for Arcueid to come near me.
<Page38>
"What? A secret?"
<Page39>
Arcueid comes up to me with an excited and expectant stride.
I put my mouth close to her ear and decided to say what I wanted to say clearly.
<Page40>
"... You know, Arcueid."
"Yes, what is it!?"
Here I go,
<Page41>
"OF COURSE NOT, YOU STUPID GIRL!"
<Page42>
You stupid girl...girl...irl....
A full-blown scream that echoes my voice.
I mercilessly slammed into Arcueid's eardrums with as much volume as I could muster.
<Page43>
"Ouch......."
Arcueid covered her ears in pain.
<Page44>
"My God, it's so loud!　What the hell are you doing all of a sudden, Shiki?!"
<Page45>
"I'm the one who should be angry!
I thought you were misunderstanding something, and then I finally found out that it was way more than just a misunderstanding"
"What...?　What do you mean...?"
<Page46>
"You thought I was an insane killer and asked me to protect and fight with you against a monster!
Oh, my God, you're so wrong!
Look, I'll tell you something, I'm not a murderer or a crazy killer. You are.... You are the first person that I have ever killed."
<Page47>
Arcueid opened her mouth with a puzzled look.
It seems that what I just said was a very unexpected statement. That realization made me think of what I had done.
<Page48>
"...You are lying. You're so good at it, are you really telling me that it was your first time, Shiki?!"
<Page49>
"... That's right. I may have these crazy eyes, but I've been living my life as decent as I can, in the best way I can.
I've never once wanted to use the lines to kill anyone."
<Page50>
"... Hmm. Then why did you kill me, a complete stranger?"
".... Well, about that."
<Page51>
I almost said 'I don't know' when I noticed that I was going to sound obnoxious.
<Page52>
"... In that moment.... I...
I felt like I was going to throw up the moment I saw you walking on the street."
All I could think of was that white figure.
<Page53>
I couldn't stop thinking about lusting over her.
I didn't even try to stop my lustful self.
<Page54>
"And like that I kept going...
Next thing I know, With these hands I-----"
<Page55>
In this very empty room, 
For no reason or purpose,
I trampled on that beautiful figure.
<Page56>
".........I see."
The strength leaves my body.
I can barely stand, and I kneel on the floor.
<Page57>
... Oh, that's right. I had no right to be angry at Arcueid.
Even if this person is alive and isn't human.
Because I'm actually killed her with my own hands.
<Page58>
"What's with this sudden silence again?
What are you trying to say, Shiki?"
"....That's why I have to tell you.....I'm sorry."
<Page59>
I forgot to do something important because of the abnormal situation.
I was too scared to face what I should have done first.
<Page60>
"... Sorry. I'm sorry, Arcueid.
I killed you here. I should have been the first to apologize for that-"
<Page61>
It's no wonder that Arcueid thought that I was a murderer.
After doing all that, I didn't confess or show any remorse, I just acted like a victim.
Not only that, but I still don't understand the impulse I had at that time.
<Page62>
"......It's true that I killed you.
　So ...... I have to take the punishment. You can't mix a murderer like me into society."
<Page63>
...... It's too cowardly to talk about that fact now.
A person who kills for no reason should never have had a place in society in the first place.
<Page64>
"... Is that so.
You really don't know why you did it, Shiki?"
... I nod while looking down. 
<Page65>
"This means you didn't do it for fun?
...Hmm. It's true some serial killers kill as if they are breathing, but you seem same to me."
"... Yeah. That's what I was trying to say, anyway."
<Page66>
"No, you are too innocent for that.
Am I just the only one who you really wanted to kill?"
"...Yeah. I've never felt that way about anyone but you."
<Page67>
"Oh, well, that settles it then.
Alright, look at me, Shiki. You're not a murderer."
"......."
<Page68>
I look up to be forgiven.
And I find her giving a confident smile, she believes in me more than I believe in myself, even after I had killed her.
<Page69>
"And I don't think you should be punished for anything.
It just so happens that the person that you wanted to kill happened to be me, and to make matters worse, you had an unparalleled skill for murder.
<Page70>
"So it's it's fortunate that I'm a vampire, so no one died, right?
So there's no need for you to be so worried. I don't think you need to bother so much about the morality of the humans' society either."
<Page71>
"No human can blame you. The only people who can blame Shiki in the world at the moment are me the victim, and you the person involved."
<Page72>
"That's true, but.....the fact that I killed you will never change."
<Page73>
That's right.
Even if it turns out that there will be no punishment because of this unique situation.
My sins will still never go away.
<Page74>
"That' s obvious. I still hold on to it, so I don't want you to forget about it so quickly either.
But you know what, Shiki? As long as you feel the same way about it and regret it for a long time, then there is no problem.
---That's a sophistic argument.
<Page75>
"Shiki. Some people will never sell their soul to the devil even if they hate the whole world. For example, there are honest people who can say 'I'm sorry' to a vampire.
So don't worry. No matter what anyone or you yourself say... You can still stay in this side of the world."
<Page76>
"..."
... I'm speechless.
How can she... Say these words with a smile to the man who killed her?
<Page77>
"Look, we have more serious problems than this right now　Now that you are awake, we need to talk about what we are going to...#do#"
<Page78>
"?!"
It happened out of nowhere.
Without any warning, Arcueid collapsed on the floor with a smile on her face.
<Page79>
"Arcueid?!"
I rush towards her fallen body.
<Page80>
"... Really now, I guess I'm not all good yet."
Arcueid exhaled a painful sigh as sweat dropped from her forehead.
...For a moment, I thought I saw a faint red color around the clothes on her belly....
<Page81>
"These wounds, you..."
She took it for me back at the hotel...
<Page82>
"That's where Vlov sliced me up. It's only healing slowly because of what you did to me.
I closed up the wound for now, but it doesn't look like that changed anything."
<Page83>
Arcueid's tone was cheerful.
However, I finally realized that there was a slight pain at the end of it.
<Page84>
"... Wait, You said you blocked it."
"Well... you see."
<Page85>
Arcueid points to an object lying on the wooden floor. A brown object. At first glance, it looked a bit like a baumkuchen, but looking closely to it, it was a hundred pieces of duct tape.
<Page86>
"You...! Stop being such an idiot!!!
　What kind of person uses duct tape to cover a wound?!"
<Page87>
"... Hey, don't call people idiot all the time.
It makes me think if I'm really one."
"Shut up, just show me your wounds...!"
<Page88>
I reach for the white clothes.
... And then.
Arcueid rolled over on the bed with a thud.
<Page89>
"Don't be dumb, what are you going to do when the wound opens?!"
"No,leave it alone like this.
You're the one who should stop being so dumb. Stripping a girl of her clothes is worse than killing her."
<Page90>
"...Whatever. I don't see you as a human being, so there is no problem with things like being a man or a woman.
I'm not going to let you get away with this. If you die from these wounds for protecting me, I'll owe you for the rest of my life."
<Page91>
And then Arcueid glared at me in frustration and rolled over to me.
<Page92>
"..."
She reluctantly stood up, keeping her mouth tightly shut.
...She looked to be in pain, but also it looked she was saying that it was fine to look at her wounds now.
<Page93>
"Alright... Let's take a look at what kind of treatment you've done."
"..."
Arcueid lifts up her clothes and exposes her abdomen.
<Page94>
"....IDIO---"
I control myself from wanting to yell at her.
The duct tape was so tightly glued that it covered her whole stomach alongside the wound.
<Page95>
I put her clothes back on and hold her.
<Page96>
"Hey! What are you doing, Shiki?"
"Putting you on the bed. As much as I wanted to take you to the hospital, that's not gonna happen."
And as I said, I put her down on the bed as carefully as I could.
<Page97>
"Listen, don't move until I get back.
If you walk around like you did before, I'll forget about you and get the hell out of here!"
<Page98>
I look around the room.
... As I thought, there was no first aid kit or anything that could help treat the wound. After all, she is something that comes back to life on her own.
This might as well be the first time that this happened to her.
I have.... about 2,000 yen... right now...
<Page99>
"No, this is no time to care about looks.
Arcueid. You said you were rich, right?"
"Well, yeah, I'm not short on money, what about it?"
<Page100>
"Cash, credit cards, whatever you can lend me. I'm going to go out and buy what I need.
... I don't know if it will work for you, but lets do the minimum amount od treatment."
<Page101>
"Alright, but it might be useless, okay?"
"I'll do it even if it's useless. I can't just leave it like this."
<Page102>
"....I understand. I have the same body structure as you and the others, this makes a tiny bit of sense."
<Page103>
"Here" says Arcueid, giving a few 10,000 yen bills.
...I don't really care right now, but did she just pop all this stack of cash out of thin air?
<Page104>
"You should lie down and stay quiet. But don't fall asleep. Even when you lie down, you must stay awake."
"Mmn... Shiki, you are asking something absurd."
<Page105>
It's absurd, but you should do it. When you sleep, your body's functions decrease along with your immune system and your resistance.
So if you fall asleep with an uncovered wound, it will get worse and worse.
Sleeping will only help your head recover from fatigue, it won't heal your wounds and illnesses. So it's better to stay awake for now until we can patch you up."
<Page106>
" ---Huh. Yeah, that sounds about right."
Arcueid smiled happily.
...I still don't get the way she thinks.
<Page107>
"... Um, why are you so happy?"
"Because I can count on you."
<Page108>
"..."
That was out of nowhere.
I control myself from saying something back and focus on what I need to do now.
First of all, I left the room, took off my blood-stained jacket, and went shopping.
Shopping---
<Page109>
...But.
When I'm about to leave, my eyes notice on something in the kitchen.
<Page110>
"...Food."
On the table, there wasn't food, but something that looked like food, something that resembled a meal in preparation.
The reason why Arcueid was in the kitchen was due to this.
<Page111>
Arcueid said that she doesn't eat regular meals.
I don't even have to think about who this was prepared for.
<Page112>
"Aaah... What's wrong with her?"
It's frustrating.
I got so frustrated with this that I ran off to get something that would give me some first aid.

<Page1>
"Have you woken up, Shiki?" 
Arcueid pokes her head out of the kitchen.
<Page2>
"Oh. What's with that scary face, did anything happen?"
Arcueid talks to me very naturally and casually.
<Page3>
"N-no. It's nothing. Well....it's, g-good morning."
<Page4>
"Yes, good morning!
Aha. It's a rare experience to greet someone in the morning."
<Page5>
"――――――"
Her unexpected smile takes my breath away.
My chilling thoughts suddenly disappear.
<Page6>
...But, I can't calm down just yet!
I got up because she wasn't there on the bed in the first place!
<Page7>
"How's your wound, Arcueid?"
"Wound? #Yeah, it's all fine now."
<Page8>
Arcueid stands there looking comfortable.
She's looking entirely back to normal, in fact, she seems to have even more energy than me.
<Page9>
"...I see. That's a relief―――"
At least the people close to me are safe.
"...Hmm?"
No, what am I thinking?
Arcueid isn't human.
Forgetting such an important thing, I'm really spaced out.
<Page10>
"...But that's still a good thing, isn't it?
Your wound isn't that big of a deal."
"Heh, what's wrong, Shiki? You were calling me a monster just a while ago."
<Page11>
"...You know? It's not about just a while ago, I still think so. But that has nothing to do with this. If you save me, I'll be grateful."
<Page12>
"Save you? You mean I did?"
<Page13>
Arcueid's eyes widen in surprise.
By the looks of it, she didn't notice it.
<Page14>
"That's right. You're the one who saved me.
...So it's a little late, but thank you for protecting me. If you hadn't pulled me out of the way, I would have burned to death too."
<Page15>
"Thank you, you say――― I don't mind, you don't have to think about it. The reason why you met Vlov was because of me, and I don't deserve to be thanked by you."
<Page16>
"But it's also true that you saved me. You always helped me out so I'm really thankful for that."
<Page17>
"...If you look at it that way I guess it's true but....
That's still wrong, Shiki. If I didn't make you watch over me, you never would have been involved in all that.
I'm the one messing up your everyday life. So wouldn't it be more appropriate for you to hate me rather than be indebted to me?"
<Page18>
Arcueid is fixated on the strangest things.
Seriously. Gratitude is a matter of feelings so there's no need for a rational explanation.
<Page19>
"I'm not wrong.
You have to take responsibility for your own actions. There was someone who taught me that a long time ago.
No matter what everyone else thinks, you have to settle what you want to do with your own hands, she said."
<Page20>
So, I don't feel any hatred or resentment towards Arcueid for making me her lookout.
At most, I would probably blame myself for getting caught up in this mess.
<Page21>
"―――I see. Now that you mention it, the reason I need a shield is that you killed me.
So I guess there's no need for me to apologize for getting you involved."
<Page22>
"Yeah, that's what I mean. This situation I'm in is my own fault."
<Page23>
"You deserved it, huh?
Yeah, you were unlucky from the start, weren't you?
If you wanted to kill someone, you could have chosen someone other than me and this wouldn't have happened."
<Page24>
".....Hey now."
The assumption that I might have killed someone other than her in the first place is impossible to make.
<Page25>
I have felt like that only once, and the only person that I stalked and killed after just walking into is Arcueid.
In fact, I don't think there's any other person I'd want to―――
<Page26>
"―――Ah."
"What? Did you remember something you forgot?
"No, it's not like I forgot something...come to think of it, why did I want to kill you...?"
<Page27>
Arcueid looks at me, furrowing her brow.
It's a natural reaction.
Since I, the perpetrator, have no idea why I killed her, how can she know?
<Page28>
"There was no reason for it, right?
Because you are a murderer at heart."
"――――――Huh?"
<Page29>
Hold on.
What did this girl say to me just now―――?
<Page30>
"You were really good at it when you attacked me.
You pressed the bell, and the moment the door opened, You barged in without saying a word.
While I was surprised, the first hit struck my vitals, and then you cut me to pieces――――"
<Page31>
"Yep, that ambush was perfect.
It was so perfect that if I could put you on canvas as you were at that moment, you would be a piece of art.
If I was still thinking straight, I would have taken it back to the castle and used it as a decoration."
<Page32>
Arcueid says something strange in a slightly euphoric voice,
But, no, that....
<Page33>
"Tha―――"
<Page34>
"But this time, you've killed the wrong person.
I don't know how many people you've killed until now, but I think it was time for you to be caught when you chose me as your prey."
<Page35>
"Th-th-that's..."
<Page36>
"What do you mean by 'Th-th-that's'? And what's with the terrified look on your face?
If you have something to say, why don't you say it clearly? There's nothing to hold back between us now, is there?"
<Page37>
Right.
After nodding, I signal for Arcueid to come near me.
<Page38>
"What? A secret?"
<Page39>
Arcueid comes up to me with an excited and expectant stride.
I put my mouth close to her ear and clearly state what I want to.
<Page40>
"...You know, Arcueid."
"Yes, what?"
Here I go,
<Page41>
"YOU'RE SO WRONG, YOU STUPID GIRL!"
<Page42>
You stupid girl...girl...irl....
A full-blown scream echoes through the room.
I mercilessly strike Arcueid's eardrums as loud as I could muster.
<Page43>
"Ow...Ouch..."
Arcueid exaggeratedly covers her ears.
<Page44>
"Hey, I'm ticked off now! What are you doing all of a sudden, Shiki?!"
<Page45>
"I'm the one who should be angry!
I thought you were misunderstanding something, but now I finally realize it's much more than that."
"Eh...? What do you mean by 'I finally realize'...?"
<Page46>
"You thought I was an insane killer when you asked me to protect and fight with you against a monster!
Oh come on, you've made a huge misunderstanding!
Look, I'll tell you something, I'm not a murderer or a crazy killer. You are――― you are the first person that I have ever killed."
<Page47>
Arcueid's mouth hangs open.
It seems that what I just said was very unexpected. That realization made me think of what I had done.
<Page48>
"―――You are lying. You're so good at it, are you really telling me that it was your first time, Shiki...?!"
<Page49>
"...That's right. I may have these strange eyes, but I've been living my life as decent as I can, in the best way I can.
I've never once wanted to use these "lines" to kill anyone."
<Page50>
"...Hmm. Then why did you kill me, a complete stranger?"
"―――Well, about that."
<Page51>
I almost said 'I don't know' when I noticed that I'm going to sound despicable.
<Page52>
"...At that moment, I...
I felt like I was going to throw up the moment I saw you walking on the street."
All I could think of was that white figure.
<Page53>
I couldn't stop thinking about lusting over her.
I didn't even try to stop my lustful self.
<Page54>
"―――And like that, I kept going.
Next thing I know, with these hands, I―――"
<Page55>
In this very room, 
For no reason or purpose,
I trampled on that beautiful figure.
<Page56>
"―――――I see."
The strength leaves my body.
Barely being able to stand, I fall to my knees on the floor.
<Page57>
...Ah, that's right. I had no right to be angry at Arcueid.
Even if this person is alive and isn't human.
Because I actually killed her with my own hands.
<Page58>
"What's with this sudden silence again?
Hey now, what are you trying to say, Shiki?"
".....That's why I have to tell you....I'm sorry..."
<Page59>
I forgot to do something important because of the abnormal situation.
I was too scared to face what I should have done first.
<Page60>
"―――Sorry. I'm sorry, Arcueid.
I killed you here. More than anything else, I should have apologized for that from the very beginning―――"
<Page61>
It's no wonder that Arcueid thought that I was a murderer.
After doing all that, without any confession or remorse, I brazenly acted like a victim.
Not only that, but I still don't understand the impulse I had at that time―――
<Page62>
"...It's true that I killed you.
So.... I have to accept my punishment. A killer like me, can't mix in with the rest of society."
<Page63>
...It's too cowardly to talk about that fact now.
A person who kills for no reason should never have had a place in society in the first place.
<Page64>
"―――I see.
You really don't understand why yourself, do you, Shiki?"
...I nod silently. 
<Page65>
"This means you didn't do it for fun?
...Hmm. It's true for some serial killers killing is like breathing, but you don't seem the same to me."
"...Yeah. That's what I was trying to say, anyway."
<Page66>
"No, you are too innocent for that.
So was I the only one who you really wanted to kill?"
"...Yeah. I've never felt that way about anyone but you."
<Page67>
"Oh, well, that settles it then.
Alright, raise your head, Shiki. You're not a murderer."
"......."
<Page68>
I look up, asking for forgiveness.
And I find her smiling confidently as she believes in me more than I believe in myself, even after I killed her.
<Page69>
"And I don't think you should be punished for anything.
It just so happens that the person that you wanted to kill was me, and to make matters worse, you had an unparalleled skill for murder."
<Page70>
"But luckily, I'm a vampire so no one died, right?
So you don't need to be troubled so much. I don't think you have to worry about those morals of human society either."
<Page71>
"No human can blame you. At the moment, the only ones in the world who can condemn you are me, the victim, and you, yourself."
<Page72>
"―――That's true, but the fact that I killed you will never change."
<Page73>
That's right.
Even if it turns out that there will be no punishment because of this unique situation.
My sin will still never go away.
<Page74>
"Of course. I still resent it even now, so it would be troubling if you just forgot.
But you know what, Shiki? As long as you feel that way about it and will always regret it, then there is no problem, right?"
―――That's a sophistic argument.
<Page75>
"Shiki. There are people who will never sell their soul to the devil even if they hate the world. For example, there are honest people who can say 'I'm sorry' to a vampire.
So don't worry. No matter what anyone says, even if you, yourself say otherwise――― you can still stay in that side of the world."
<Page76>
"―――――"
...I'm speechless.
How can she――― say that with a smile to the man who killed her?
<Page77>
"Look, we have more serious problems than this right now. Now that you are awake, we need to talk about what we are going to...#do#"
<Page78>
"?!"
Suddenly, it happened.
Without any warning, Arcueid collapses to the floor with a smile on her face.
<Page79>
"Arcueid?!"
I rush towards her fallen body.
<Page80>
"...Really now, I guess I'm not quite there yet."
Arcueid breathes painfully as sweat glistens from her forehead.
...For a moment, I think I spotted a faint red color around the clothes on her stomach....
<Page81>
"You, this wound―――"
She got it from protecting me back at the hotel―――
<Page82>
"That's where Vlov sliced me up. It's only healing slowly because of what you did to me.
I've closed up the wound for now, but it seems it didn't work too well."
<Page83>
Arcueid's tone is cheerful.
However, I finally notice that every she speaks, there is a slight pain at the end.
<Page84>
"...'Closed up the wound'? With what?"
"Ummm, that."
<Page85>
Arcueid points to an object lying on the wooden floor. A brown object. At first glance, it looks a bit like a Baumkuchen, but looking closely at it, it's a roll of 100-yen duct tape.
<Page86>
"S-stop being such an idiot!!!
What kind of person uses duct tape to close off a wound...?!"
<Page87>
"...Hey, you shouldn't call people idiots all the time.
It makes me think if I'm really one."
"Shut up, just show me your wound...!"
<Page88>
I reach out for her white clothes.
...However.
Arcueid rolls over on the bed with a thud.
<Page89>
"Don't be ridiculous, what are you going to do when the wound opens?!"
"It's fine, just leave it alone like this.
You should stop acting stupid too. Stripping a girl of her clothes is worse than killing her."
<Page90>
"―――Hey now. I don't see you as a human being, so there is no problem with things like being a man or a woman.
Come on, just stay still. If you die from this wound from protecting me, I'll owe you for the rest of my life."
<Page91>
Arcueid glares at me in displeasure, and this time, rolls towards me.
<Page92>
"........"
She reluctantly stands up, keeping her mouth tightly shut.
...It seems she's a bit sulky, but I guess it's okay to look at the wound.
<Page93>
"Alright. ...Let's take a look at what kind of treatment you've done."
"......"
Arcueid lifts her clothes and exposes her abdomen.
<Page94>
"――――――IDIO..."
I hold back the urge to yell at her.
The duct tape is so tightly attached that it covers her whole stomach alongside the wound.
<Page95>
I put her clothes back on and pick her up in my arms.
<Page96>
"Hey! What are you doing, Shiki?"
"Putting you on the bed. As much as I wanted to take you to the hospital, that's not gonna happen."
Just like that, I place her down on the bed as carefully as I could.
<Page97>
"Listen, don't move until I get back.
If you walk around as you did before, I'll forget about you and get the hell out of here!"
<Page98>
I look around the room.
...As I thought, there's no first aid kit or anything that can help treat the wound. After all, she is something that comes back to life on her own.
This might as well be the first time that this happened to her.
I have....about 2,000 yen...right now...
<Page99>
"No, this is no time to care about looks.
Arcueid. You said you were rich, right?"
"Y-yeah, I'm not short on money, what about it?"
<Page100>
"Cash, credit cards, whatever you can lend me. I'm going to buy some things I'll need to treat you.
...I don't know if it will work for you, but let's do the minimum amount of treatment."
<Page101>
"Fine but, it might be useless, okay?"
"I'll do it even if it's useless. I can't just leave it like this."
<Page102>
"...I see. My body is the same as you and the others, this might have a bit of sense."
<Page103>
"Here" says Arcueid, giving a few 10,000 yen bills.
...I don't really care right now, but did she just pop all this stack of cash out of thin air?
<Page104>
"You lie down and stay quiet. But don't fall asleep. Even when you lie down, you must stay awake."
"Mmn... Shiki, you are asking something absurd."
<Page105>
"It's absurd, but you should do it. When you sleep, your body's functions decrease along with your immune system and your resistance.
So if you fall asleep with an open wound, it will get worse and worse.
Sleeping will only help your head recover from fatigue, it won't heal your wounds and illnesses. So it's better to stay awake for now until I can patch you up."
<Page106>
"―――Heh. Yeah, that sounds about right."
Arcueid smiles happily.
...As expected, I still don't get the way she thinks.
<Page107>
"...Hey now, why are you so happy there?"
"Because I can count on you."
<Page108>
"........"
That was out of nowhere.
I control myself from saying something back and focus on what I need to do now.
First of all, I leave the room, take off my blood-stained jacket, and go shopping.
Shopping―――
<Page109>
...But.
When I'm about to leave, I notice something in the kitchen.
<Page110>
"―――Food."
On the table, there was something prepared that's less like a meal and more like food. Actually, it was less like food and more like just ingredients, something best described as 'a food-like thing'.
The reason why Arcueid was in the kitchen was because of this.
<Page111>
Arcueid said that she doesn't eat regular meals.
I don't even have to think about who this was prepared for.
<Page112>
"Damn it―――what's wrong with her?"
I'm getting very irritated.
I'm getting so irritated, I decide to hurry up and get something to treat her as fast as possible.

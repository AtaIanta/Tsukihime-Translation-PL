<Page1>
"Did you notice that, Shiki?" 
Arcueid poked her head out of the kitchen.
<Page2>
"Mmm. What's with that scary face?"
Arcueid talked to me very naturally and casually.
<Page3>
"N-no. It's nothing. Well.... It's, g-good morning."
<Page4>
"Yes, good morning!
Hmm. It's a rare experience to greet someone in the morning."
<Page5>
"――――――"
The unexpected smile took my breath away.
The thoughts that were creeping me out suddenly disappeared with it.
<Page6>
.... But, I can't calm down just yet!
I got up from the bed because she wasn't there in the first place!
<Page7>
"How's your wound, Arcueid?"
"Wound？# Erm, it's all fine for now."
<Page8>
Arcueid stood there looking comfortable.
She was looking like entirely back to normal, in fact she seemed to have even more energy than me.
<Page9>
"......Is that so. That's a relief―――"
At least. The people close to me are safe.
"......Uh？"
What was I thinking?
Arcueid isn't human.
To forget this basic fact is beyond sleepwalking.
<Page10>
"......But、that's still a good thing, isn't it?
Your wound isn't that big of a deal.
"Huh, What's wrong with you, Shiki? You were calling me a monster just a while ago."
<Page11>
"...... You know? It's not aboout just a while ago, I still think so. But that has nothing to do with this. If you help me, I'll be grateful."
<Page12>
"I helped you?"
<Page13>
Arcueid's eyes widened in surprise.
By the looks of it, she didn't notice it.
<Page14>
"That's right. You're the one who saved me.
.... That's why I'm grateful to you for protecting me all this time. If you hadn't pulled me over, I would have burned to death too."
<Page15>
"Thank you...? Well, I don't mind, you don't have to think this way. The reason why you met Vlov was because of me, and I don't deserve to be thanked by you, Shiki."
<Page16>
"But it's also true that you saved me. You always helped me out and I'm thankful for that.
<Page17>
"... ... If you look at it that way I guess it's true but....
You're wrong, Shiki. If you weren't on the lookout you wouldn't have gone through what you did.
I am the one who poisoned your life. You can hate me, but it's wrong to thank me, isn't it?"
<Page18>
Arcuied is obsessed with the strangest things.
Seriously. Gratitude is a matter of feelings. There's no need for a rational explanation.
<Page19>
"I am not wrong.
You have to take responsibility for your own actions. There was someone who taught me that a long time ago.
No matter what everyone else thinks, you have to settle what you want with your own hands."
<Page20>
So, I don't feel any hatred or resentment towards Arcueid for having been on guard duty.
At most, I would probably blame myself for getting caught up in this mess.
<Page21>
"--I see. The reason I need a shield in the first place is because you killed me.
So there's no need for me to apologize for getting you involved?"
<Page22>
"Yeah, that's what I mean. I deserved it..."
<Page23>
"I suppose you got what you deserved.
Yeah, you were unlucky from the start, weren't you?
If you wanted to kill someone, you could have chosen someone other than me and this wouldn't have happened."
<Page24>
"........You know what?"
The assumption that I might have killed someone other than her in the first place is impossible to make.
<Page25>
The only person I've ever felt that way about, the only person I've ever killed after walking around for no apparent reason, is Arcuied.
In fact, I don't think there's any other person I'd want to...
<Page26>
".......Ah"
"What? Did you forget something?
"No, I guess I just remembered something. ...... Come to think of it, why would I want to kill you ......?"
<Page27>
Arcueid looked at me with a confused look.
It's a natural reaction.
I'm the one who did it and I have no idea why I killed Arcueid.
<Page28>
"There's no reason for it, is there?
Because Shiki is a murderer at heart."
"...... Uh?"
<Page29>
　Hold on.
That girl.... What did she just say to me?
<Page30>
"You were really good at it when you attacked me.
You pressed the chime, and the moment the door opened, You put your hands in and barged in without saying a word.
While I were surprised, the first hit struck my vitals, and then torn me to pieces...."
<Page31>
"Yeah, that surprise was perfect.
How perfect could it be? It was so perfect that if you were to put Shiki on canvas as he was, it would be an artpiece.
If I were still normal, I'd take it back to the castle and decorate it.
<Page32>
Arcueid said something strange in a slightly euphoric voice,
But, no, that.
<Page33>
"So...."
<Page34>
"But this time, you killed the bad person.
I don't know how many people you've killed in your life, Shiki, but when you chose me as your prey, it was time to pay your annual tribute, wasn't it?"
<Page35>
"Yes, that's it."
<Page36>
" What do you mean by "Yes. That's it"? What's with the scary look on your face?
If you have something to say, why don't you say it clearly? There's nothing between you and I that we have to put up with now, is there?"
<Page37>
Right.
After nodding I signaled for Arcueid to come near me.
<Page38>
"What? A secret?"
<Page39>
Arcueid comes up to me with an excited and expectant stride.
I put my mouth close to her ear and decided to say what I wanted to say clearly.
<Page40>
"... You know, Arcueid."
"Yes, what's up?"
Here I go,
<Page41>
"There's no such reason, you idiot!"
<Page42>
You idiot, idiot, iot....
A full-blown scream that echoes my voice.
I merciless slammed into Arcueid's eardrums with relentless full power and as much volume as I could muster.
<Page43>
"Ou....ch....."
Arcueid exaggeratedly covered her ears.
<Page44>
"Jeez, it's so loud!　What the hell are you doing all this of sudden, Shiki?!"
<Page45>
"I'm the one who should be angry!
I thought you were asking something messed up to be done, and then I finally found out that's exactly what you were doing!"
"What...?　What do you mean...?"
<Page46>
"You thought I was an insane killer and asked me to protect and fight with you against a monster!
Oh, my God, you're making a terrible mistake!
Look, I'll tell you something, I'm not a murderer or a crazy killer. You are.... You are the first person that I have ever killed."
<Page47>
Arcueid makes a small pout.
I noticed only now what I did, giving that very unexpected observation.
<Page48>
"...You are lying. You're so good at it, are you really telling me that it was your first time, Shiki?!"
<Page49>
"... That's right. I may have these crazy eyes, but I've been living my life as decent as I can, in the best way I can.
I've never once wanted to use the lines to kill anyone."
<Page50>
"... Hmm. Then why did you kill me, a complete stranger?"
".... Well, about that."
<Page51>
I almost said "I don't know" when I noticed that I was going to sound obnoxious.
<Page52>
"... In that moment.... I...
I felt like I was going to throw up the moment I saw you walking on the street."
All I could think of was that white figure.
<Page53>
And I couldn't even stop thinking about lusting over her.
with a smirk on my face.
<Page54>
"...I... I'll keep going.
And then the next I notice is that I'm holding your hands."
<Page55>
In this very empty room, 
For no reason or purpose,
I trampled on that beautiful shape.
<Page56>
".........I see."
The strength leaves my body.
I can't stand or kneel on the floor.
<Page57>
... Oh, that's right. I had no right to be angry at Arcueid.
Even if this person is alive and isn't human.
Because I'm actually killing her with my own hands.
<Page58>
"What's with this sudden silence again?
What are you trying to say, Shiki?"
"....That's why I have to tell you... I'm sorry."
<Page59>
I forgot something important during this unexepected moment.
I was afraid to run away from what I should have done in the first place.
<Page60>
"... Sorry. I'm sorry, Arcueid.
I killed you here. I should have been the first to apologize for that-"
<Page61>
It's no wonder that Arcueid thought that I was a serial killer.
After doing all that, I didn't confess or show any remorse, I just acted like a victim.
Even more so, I still don't get it what was the impulse I had at that moment...
<Page62>
"... Undoubtely, I killed you.
So... I have to be punished. You can't mix this kind of murderer into everyone's society."
<Page63>
... It's not fair for me to be talking about what happened now.
A person who kills for no reason should never have had a place in the first place.
<Page64>
"... Is that so.
You really don't know why you did it, Shiki?"
... I nod looking down. 
<Page65>
"This means you didn't felt that it was fun?
... Yeah. It's true some serial killers kill as if they were breathing, but Shiki is normal usually."
"... Yeah. That's what I was trying to say, anyway."
<Page66>
"No, you are too healthy for that.
Am I just the only one who you really wanted to kill?"
"...Oh. I've never felt that way about anyone but Arcueid."
<Page67>
"Oh, well, it settles it then.
Alright, look at me, Shiki. You're not a murderer."
"..."
<Page68>
I look up to be forgiven.
And I found her giving a confident smile, she believed in me more than I believed myself, even if I had killed her.
<Page69>
"And I don't think you should be punished for anything.
It just so happens that the person Shiki wanted to kill was me. The only problem is that Shiki is very skillful at killing."
<Page70>
"So it's it's fortunate that I'm a vampire, so no one died, right?
So there's no need for Shiki to be so worried. I don't think you need to bother so much about the morality of the humans' society either."
<Page71>
"No human can blame you. The only people who can blame Shiki in the world at the moment are me, the victim, and Shiki himself, the person involved."
<Page72>
"That's true, but... But the fact that I killed you will never change."
<Page73>
That's right.
Even if it turns out that there will be no punishment because of this unique situation.
My sins are the only ones that will never go away.
<Page74>
"That's natural. I'm still attached to it, and I don't want you to forget about it so easily.
But you know, Shiki? If you think this way and regret it for a long time, so it's all fine, right?"
... That's sophism.
<Page75>
"Shiki. Some people will never sell their soul to the devil even if they hate the whole world. For example, there are honest people who can say "I'm sorry" to a vampire.
So don't worry. No matter what anyone says or Shiki himself says... He can still stay in that side of the world."
<Page76>
"..."
... I'm speechless.
How can she... Say these words with a smile to the man who killed her?
<Page77>
"Look, we have more serious problems than this right now, don't we?　Now that Shiki is awake, we need to talk about the future...#And#"
<Page78>
"?!"
It happened out of nowhere.
Without any warning, Arcueid fell to the floor with a smile on her face.
<Page79>
"Arcueid?!"
I run to her lying body.
<Page80>
"... Really now, I guess I'm not all good yet."
Said Arcueid exhaled a painful sigh as sweat dropped from her forehead.
...For a moment, I thought I saw a faint red color around the belly of the clothes...
<Page81>
"These wounds, you..."
She took it for me back at the hotel...
<Page82>
"That's where Vlov sliced me up. It's only healing slowly because of what Shiki did to me.
I closed up the wound for now, but it doesn't look like that changed anything."
<Page83>
Arcueid's tone was cheerful.
But I finally noticed that there was a faint paint at the end.
<Page84>
"... Why? You said you blocked it."
"Well, you see."
<Page85>
Arcueid points to an object lying on the wooden floor. A brown object. At first glance, it looked a bit like a baumkuchen, but looking closely to it, it was a hundred pieces of duct tape.
<Page86>
"You...! Stop being such an idiot!!!
　What kind of person uses duct tape to cover a wound?!"
<Page87>
"... Hey, don't call people idiot all the time.
It makes me think if I'm really one."
"Shut up, just show me your wounds...!"
<Page88>
I go for the white clothes.
... And then.
Arcueid rolled over on the bed with a thud.
<Page89>
"Don't be dumb, what are you going to do when the wound opens?!"
"Fine, just go on with it.
You're the one who should stop being so dumb. Stripping a girl of her clothes is worse than killing her."
<Page90>
"...Whatever. I don't see you as a human being, so there is no problem with things like being a man or a woman.
I'm not going to let you get away with this. If you die from these wounds for protecting me, I'll owe youe for the rest of my life."
<Page91>
And then Arcueid glared at me in frustration and rolled over to me.
<Page92>
"..."
She reluctantly stood up, keeping her mouth tightly shut.
...She looked to be in pain, but also it looked she was saying that was fine to look at her wounds now.
<Page93>
"Alright... Let's take a long at what kind of treatment you've done."
"..."
Arcueid lifts up her clothes and exposes her abdomen.
<Page94>
"....Gah."
I control myself from wanting to yell at her.
The duct tape was so tightly glued that it covered her whole stomach alongside the wound.
<Page95>
I put Arcueid's clothes back on and hold her.
<Page96>
"Hey! What are you doing, Shiki?"
"Put you on the bed. As much as I wanted to take you to the hospital, that's not gonna happen."
And as I said, I put her down on the bed as carefully as I could.
<Page97>
"Listen, don't move until I get back.
If you walk around like you did before, I'll forget about you and get the hell out of here!"
<Page98>
I look around the room.
... As I thought, there was no first aid kit or anything that could help treat the wound. After all, she is something that comes back to life on her own.
This might as well be the first time that this happened to her.
I have.... about 2,000 yen... right now...
<Page99>
"No, this is no time to look nice.
Arcueid. You said you were rich."
"Well, yeah, I'm not short of money, what about it?"
<Page100>
"Cash, credit cards, whatever you can lend me. I'm going to go out and buy what I need.
... I don't know if it will work for you, but I'll help with everything I can get from it."
<Page101>
"Alright, but it might be useless, okay?"
"I'll do it even if it's useless. I can't just let it happen."
<Page102>
"... Got it. I have the same body structure as Shiki and the others, this makes a tiny bit of sense."
<Page103>
"Here" says Arcueid, giving a few 10,000 yen bills.
...I don't really care right now, but did she just pop all this stack of cash out of think air?
<Page104>
"You should lie down and stay quiet. But don't fall asleep. Even when you lie down, you must stay awake."
"Mmm ... Shiki, you are asking something absurd."
<Page105>
It's absurd, but you should do it. When you sleep, your body's functions decrease. Your immune system, your resistance.
So if you fall asleep with an uncovered wound, it will get worse and worse.
Sleeping will only help your head recover from fatigue, it won't heal your wounds and illnesses. So it's better to stay awake for now until we can patch you up."
<Page106>
"...Yeah, that's what I meant."
Arcueid smiled happily.
...I still don't get the way she thinks.
<Page107>
"... Um, why are you so happy?"
"Because I can count on you."
<Page108>
"..."
I"m get off guard.
I control myself from saying something back and focus on what I need to do now.
First, I have to leave the room, take off his blood-stained jacket,
And go shopping...
<Page109>
...But.
When I'm about to leave, my eyes notice on something in the kitchen.
<Page110>
"...Food."
On the table, there wasn't food, but something that looked like food, something that resembled a meal was prepared.
The reason why Arcueid was in the kitchen was due this.
<Page111>
Arcueid did say doesn't eat a normal meal.
I don't even need to think about to who this was intended for.
<Page112>
"Jeez... What's up with her?"
It's frustrating.
I got so frustrated wit this I ran off to get something that would give me some first aid.

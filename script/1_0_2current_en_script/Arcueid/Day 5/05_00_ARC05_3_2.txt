"――――――"
If I'm being honest, I don't think we can let Vlov off the hook for even a second.
... But doing that would be too reckless.
<Page2>
For us to just find him and then defeat him? That's not even worth considering.
That kind of thought is just an irresponsible escape from reality to lower my feeling of guilt.
<Page3>
... I need to collect myself.
I must do so if I really want to defeat that vampire.
I understand that if I truly want to reduce the number of casualties, I have no choice but to wait here.
<Page4>
But still――― three days is far too long.
<Page5>
"... Arcueid.
You said that my duty as a guard ended yesterday, right?"
<Page6>
"I did say that, but... What? Are you still scared after all?"
"No, that's not what I meant. If we're doing this as a team and not out of obligation, then I have a favor to ask of you.
I will do as you say. I'll follow your instructions. I may not be able to act as your shield, but I can at least become your knife.
That's why in return―――"
<Page7>
"In return?"
"――― I can't wait three days. Let's lure him out tonight."
<Page8>
"Um... are you being serious?"
Arcueid is taken aback at my suicidal remark.
I am fully aware of how dangerous it is. Even so, there is a line that I cannot cross.
<Page9>
"Do you think I can joke at a time like this?
I don't want to die either. So please listen to me. If you were to rest until tonight, will you be able to defeat Vlov together with my eyes?"
<Page10>
Arcueid is the only one who can judge that.
That's why... if she decides that it's possible, then I will wager everything on that possibility.
<Page11>
"... I see. If you move exactly the way I tell you to, then I guess we'll be the ones that are stronger.
But is that really okay? It would be much safer to wait three days you know."
"... I know that. But this is as far as I can tolerate. My mind won't let me wait any longer."
<Page12>
"Hmm.... Well, in that case it's fine.
And to be honest, there is only a small chance that we'll be able to avoid him for three days."
<Page13>
"So now I guess we're moving to a strategy council meeting.
Where do you want to fight, Shiki?"
"Eh? Wait, but... is that really okay?"
<Page14>
I couldn't help but ask back.
I didn't think that Arcueid would listen to my request so easily as someone who gets serious when it comes to battle.
<Page15>
"I told you that it would be fine.
Either we keep running for three days, or we go and kill Vlov tonight.
They both have the same chance of success either way. The only difference is in your own chance of survival."
<Page16>
"... I see. Thank you, Arcueid."
"I wouldn't recommend it though.
You really are a mystery, Shiki."
<Page17>
I've narrowed down my own chances of defeating Vlov.
It's only natural that Arcueid is taken back, as she is someone who values efficiency and certainty.
But even so, Arcueid did not reject my idea.
<Page18>
I wonder if it is because she respects my feelings, or if it is because the odds wouldn't change either way.
Well in any case, I'm grateful that she is able to understand.

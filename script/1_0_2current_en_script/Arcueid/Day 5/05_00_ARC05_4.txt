We move to the park just after 9 PM.
<Page2>
"It's important, so I'll explain it one more time.
Those who have lived long enough have the ability to use their existence as a weapon.
In addition to the basic abilities of vampires, these individuals have a special spell that comes from drinking blood."
<Page3>
"Vlov is a mortal who has reached that level.
Defeating the Dead Apostles means defeating their supernatural abilities.
As long as we don't acquire the means to extinguish the flames, there is no way for a human to win. So...until I break Vlov's spell, you stay away from him, Shiki."
<Page4>
The plan itself is quite simple.
Arcueid is here to lure Vlov out.
If the vampires don't hide their biological wavelength, they can be sensed by other vampires.
<Page5>
Apparently, Vlov doesn't hide his wavelength.
Whether he doesn't want to or simply can't is unknown.
<Page6>
As a matter of fact, if Vlov approaches, Arcueid can detect this in advance.
On the other hand, Arcueid has always suppressed her wavelength, but now she is releasing it to provoke Vlov.
<Page7>
It's a light that attracts moths.
All you have to do is wait for a moth named Vlov to be lured by the light of Arcueid.
<Page8>
The rest goes as planned.
I'll hide in the bushes and watch the fight.
And when Arcueid has Vlov chained up, I'll jump out of the shadows.
And cut his lines.
<Page9>
Arcueid doesn't look nervous.
She just stares blankly at the sky in boredom.
<Page10>
".................."
But that's not how it works for me.
I grab the knife that I kept in my pocket.
<Page11>
...I know.
There are a few uncertainties in this strategy.
<Page12>
One is in case Vlov detects me hiding.
Arcueid says that this possibility is extremely low, but it's still not zero.
If that happens, my safety cannot be guaranteed. There is a risk that I will be burned without being able to do anything, like what happened at the hotel.
<Page13>
But that's okay.
That's a risk I'm willing to take.
The problem is that there is another possibility.
If Arcueid is unable to restrain Vlov...in other words, if Vlov takes her down.
<Page14>
...I'm the only one who can do it then.
It's up to this one knife to stop Vlov and save Arcueid.
<Page15>
That vampire.
Can I really...kill that vampire by myself?
<Page16>
My limbs tremble at the thought of it.
The fingertips holding the knife clench the handle so hard it hurts.
...An indescribable fear.
I can't figure out what it is that's causing this.
<Page17>
"Are you scared, Shiki?"
The next thing I know, Arcueid is standing right in front of me.
...It's pitiful. I think she found out I was trembling.
<Page18>
"Yeah, it's scary as hell. Just the thought of that vampire coming near me makes me want to cry."
"Shiki, are you crying?"
"I'm just trying to hold it in, that's all. Understand, idiot."
<Page19>
She's really an insensitive. I want her to understand my intentions a little bit at least.
<Page20>
"......."
But.
I don't know what it was that frustrated Arcueid, but she doesn't seem to like my response.
<Page21>
"By the way, I'm also a vampire."
"Yeah. I know. I've heard it a million times."
<Page22>
"I'm asking you why you are not afraid of me.
Based on your definition so far, I think I would be disgusting as a creature."
"What?"
<Page23>
....I get a little surprised when she points it out.
That's true...but....
<Page24>
"Well, you're an exception. You've never sucked blood, have you? That's fine then. I don't care if you're a vampire or not, as long as you leave us alone."
<Page25>
"I see. That's one way of thinking about it."
Arcueid says approvingly.
<Page26>
The hands of the clock point to ten o'clock.
According to Arcueid, this is when the vampires start their activities.
<Page27>
...Vlov will come to the surface.
I don't know where his stronghold is, but I'm sure the awakened Vlov will sense Arcueid's presence and head for this park.
<Page28>
"――――――Seriously?"
Arcueid's tone changes.
With a mutter of intense disgust, she glares in the direction of the north station.
<Page29>
"Arcueid...?"
"I can't believe he's really one of the Ancestors"
<Page30>
I turn my gaze in the direction Arcueid is looking.
Is that...smoke?
There's smoke in the sky.
There's a fire somewhere―――no, wait.
that's...!
<Page31>
"Arcueid, is that...?"
"It's Vlov. He's attacking random people."
<Page32>
"It was naive of me to think that his sanity was lacking. He is no different from the undead. If he didn't have enough blood, he would replenish it from the people in front of him. He has no grasp of the rules of civilized society, of humanity in this age."
<Page33>
A loud explosion rings out in the distance.
The black smoke rising into the night sky is gaining momentum.
This is not good. This is nothing compared to what happened at the hotel. If he appears in a crowded downtown area, the casualties will be staggering...!
<Page34>
"Arcueid...!"
"I know. Let's hurry, Shiki."
<Page35>
I start running towards the station.
What the hell is going on here...

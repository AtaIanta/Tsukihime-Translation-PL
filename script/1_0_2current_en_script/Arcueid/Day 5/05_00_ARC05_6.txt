"Ha, ha―――!"
As I leave the building, I see a pile of debris in front of me.
I advance forward while bending over, stopping just before the collapsed surface.

The hollow is now 40 meters underground.
This area used to be a park.
But now there is no trace of it anymore.
The rubble formed a slope that leads to the ground below.
Although it is impossible to climb up from the bottom, I should be able to slide down even with legs like mine.
With that being said―――
C:>I go down.
C:>I observe the situation.

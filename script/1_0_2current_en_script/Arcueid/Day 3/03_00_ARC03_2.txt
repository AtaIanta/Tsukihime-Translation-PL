"Hey, Akiha,
about yesterday, is it like that here every night?"
"--------What?"
"I'm talking about last night.
You and the others couldn't sleep either, right?"
"I slept fine last night....... what are you talking about?"
"I'm talking about the dog of course.
A wild dog was barking all night around 11 o'clock."
Akiha and Kohaku-san look at each other and then look at me with concern in their eyes.
...I don't like the fact that they're thinking I'm a sleepwalker or something like that.
<Page2>
"It's all right, I won't ask you.
Kohaku-san, it was loud last night, wasn't it?"
<Page3>
"---Well, I'm not sure.
I think it was windy last night, but the only unusual thing we found during our midnight patrol was that you were asleep on the bed in your uniform."
"......Oh, you mean that? I'll be more careful from now on."
<Page4>
"What? What happened, Kohaku?"
"No, nothing really happened.
It's just that Shiki-san was sleeping a little rough, that's all."
<Page5>
With a smile on her face, Kohaku-san let Akiha's question slide.
<Page6>
"......Are you sure neither of you noticed?
Last night, there was a wild dog barking outside for half an hour. Woof woof woof woof, it was so loud."
<Page7>
"Oh you mean like in WanWan Panic."
It doesn't look like they believe me.
<Page8>
"......Well, that's it in a nutshell."
"I do not remember any of that.
You do not either Kohaku, do you?"
<Page9>
"Well... I'm sorry Shiki-san, but I don't think that's what happened."
<Page10>
"That is settled. The only other possible case is that Nii-san was dreaming of a dog barking at him."
"............Ugh."
<Page11>
When two people tell me that, I'm not so sure.
......When I think about it, it's strange that I heard that howl. There were no dogs outside, and the road...
<Page12>
There was no one on the street.
The more they say it was a dream, the more I think it was.
<Page13>
"You are not used to the mansion yet, so you must have had such a bad dream.
Well, if the wild dogs continue to bark tonight, I think I will get a very ferocious guard dog."
Akiha smiles wickedly.
<Page14>
"It is time for me to go, so I will leave you to it. Nii-san, please be careful not to get attacked by dogs on your way to school."
<Page15>
Akiha leaves the living room with grace.
In order to see her master off, Kohaku-san also leaves the room while bowing to me.

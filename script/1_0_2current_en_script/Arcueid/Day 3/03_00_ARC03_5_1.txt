...This is a bad dream.
But then why is the smell of blood so horribly real?
<Page2>
"...A mis, take."
A mistake  A mistake  A mistake  A mistake.
A mistake  A mistake  A mistake  A mistake.
Is it a mistake that I was the one who killed her.
Or is it a mistake that I wasn't the one who killed her.
<Page3>
"...But I have no reason to."
No, I know exactly why.
When I looked at her, I could only think of one thing.
<Page4>
"I――――"
Yes, I―――
Tohno Shiki wanted to kill that girl.
<Page5>
That was all I could think about at that time.
I just didn't try to put that image into words because the inside of my head was a mush.
<Page6>
"A mis――――take."
The smell of blood is making me nauseous.
"Ah―――ugh"
Something in my stomach is coming back up.
<Page7>
"Ah―――ah."
The vermilion color seeps into my eyeballs.
The dizziness shakes my brain.
Just like that, I fall to my knees in a sea of red blood.
<Page8>
"Hurk――ughh――"
My gastric juice refluxes back up.
I throw up everything in my stomach.
I throw up all the food and gastric juice while crying.
<Page9>
There is nothing left in my stomach.
And yet, my body forces me to vomit, as if it wants to pretend that what happened never did and to return to my normal daily life.
<Page10>
"Hurg――――ahh"
It hurts.
It hurts like my insides are burning.
I couldn't stop crying and my body collapses to the ground like a piece of discarded garbage.
<Page11>
My body is now stained red.
It is painful and red, like watching a dream.
<Page12>
I couldn't stop crying.
I'm terribly sad that I had killed a person.
...No, that's not it.
I'm sad that I killed her as easily as I killed a doll, without meaning, without mercy.
<Page13>
―――I don't understand.
I don't know why I'm feeling this way,
I don't know why I killed her for no reason,
I don't understand why.
<Page14>
"――――It's a lie."
Because it doesn't feel real.
I mean, I feel dizzy like I always do.
It's just a dream that I saw while I was―――
<Page15>
"――――It's a lie."
I mean, how can it be possible for a single knife to tear a person apart like that.
I've heard that it takes an entire day of hard work to dismember a single human being, even with a saw.
<Page16>
So there's no way it can be done with just a knife like this.
In the first place, there is no such thing as a 'line', it's just a fantasy that I have in my mind.
<Page17>
"――――It's a lie."
The gastric juice keeps dripping from my lips.
My mouth, from the chin down, is sticky with stomach fluids.
The gastric juice blends with the color of red.
There is nothing to vomit, but my stomach contracts, and my esophagus and my throat are bleeding.
<Page18>
"It...hurts―――"
It hurts.
So I'm sure.
This isn't a dream, I'm just lying to myself.
<Page19>
"―――Everything, is all a lie."
Yes, I really do understand.
I was lusting after her. I was excited to see this girl.
<Page20>
It's the same with my eyes.
I already understood that these 'lines' would cut things like cutting paper.
Tohno Shiki should have known that humans can be easily torn apart.//randomly switches to third person, maybe replace with I? 　遠野志貴は、人間だって簡単にバラしてしまうと理解していた筈なのに。
I just lived irresponsibly, without thinking about it.
<Page21>
...If I'm a dangerous person who can easily kill anyone,
I should have blinded myself or lived a life where I can never see anyone.
<Page22>
"...I'm sorry, Sensei."
―――I'm so sorry.
I couldn't even keep such a simple promise――――
<Page23>
"Am I―――still sane?"
I don't know. The impulses that had arisen earlier are no longer there.
<Page24>
But at that time, I didn't even think about enduring or suppressing these thoughts.
"Kill that girl."
I was thinking and doing such things as a matter of course.
<Page25>
...Then the answer is simple.
I'm sure I've gone crazy.
It probably started seven years ago.
From an accident that should have killed me.
From that moment I miraculously survived―――――――

Sensei once told me.
The things that my eyes see are the lines along which something can easily be cut.
To put it in the terms of a human body, it is like a joint that is easily broken,
or like a soft eyeball.
<Page2>
As long as I put my blade in and slice through it, no force is required.
With no resistance or friction, anything can be cut.
This doesn't just apply to the human body but also to minerals, or anything else for that matter,
these "lines" appear equally on everything within my sight.
<Page3>
"Listen carefully, Shiki.
Everything has a fate of being "broken". As long as it has a shape, it can't escape this fate, right?"
<Page4>
Therefore, the world itself is also full of cracks, and could fall apart at any time.
If there are lines running along the surface of the earth as well.
Some day, there's a chance that for no real reason at all the ground could split apart, and anything and everything will be destroyed.
At least, in the world that I see, there is always that possibility.
<Page5>
"And we humans are even more fragile.
Injuries and recoveries, aging and growth, rise and fall, are all changes that bring us closer to the end."
<Page6>
When I understood the meaning of what she said, I thanked Sensei for the glasses from the bottom of my heart.
I mean, it is true, isn't it? If I could see these lines all the time, I wouldn't be able to live properly.
<Page7>
The lines along which things be broken.
A world where nothing is firmly joined together. // Lit. no sure/certain union/binding/joining
Even if you could see it,
there is nothing to be gained by seeing such things-----
<Page8>
"------hmnnn."
I wake up from old memories.
I feel the morning light through my eyelids and crawl my hands under my pillow with my eyes closed.
<Page9>
...huh...my glasses...?
Feeling uneasy, I grope around the right side of the pillow to try and find my glasses, and quickly pick them up.
<Page10>
It's my habit to keep them on the left side of my pillow... but maybe I had a bad headache last night and didn't have time for that.
<Page11>
"...Ah."
I put on my glasses and then open my eyelids.
If someone is watching, they may think it's a strange habit, but I like to avoid looking at the lines in the morning as much as possible.
<Page12>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama."
"Eek?"
<Page13>
When I turn around to face the wall, there is a girl in a maid's uniform standing there.
She didn't give any hint of her presence so I didn't notice her, but it appears she has been there for some time.
Just like yesterday, she must have come to wake me up so that I wouldn't oversleep.
<Page14>
"I see. I'm sorry, it was strange to be surprised.
Good morning, Hisui. Thank you for coming to wake me up."
<Page15>
"That is my job, so please do not mind me."
<Page16>
Hisui bows her head solemnly.
...But. As she does so, she suddenly stops moving and then swiftly raises her head.
<Page17>
"No, it is not that my job is to surprise you.
---I will make every effort not to surprise you tomorrow."
<Page18>
...She's a maid with a subtle sense of humor.
Even though she is perfectly capable of performing her duties as a maidservant, it feels as though she is not accustomed to socializing.
<Page19>
"No, I don't have any problem with you.
It's my fault, I'm still getting used to it."
<Page20>
When I get out of bed, I realize that I have been dressed in my pajamas.
...If I remember rightly, last night I changed into my school uniform because of the howling... and after I came back, I thought I collapsed straight into bed...?
<Page21>
"...That's weird. I thought I fell asleep in my uniform."
<Page22>
"Yes. It would not have been good for your health if you stayed like that, so I asked Nee-san to come and change you in to your pajamas."
<Page23>
Hisui explains the situation to me as if it's natural.
I see. You changed my clothes for me.
Sleeping in your uniform won't make you sick, but it will wrinkle and you'll be more comfortable in your pajamas. As expected of a professional maid, she's very thorough...wait a minute.
<Page24>
"Changed my clothes?"
I check my pants and underwear.
My pants are a new set of pajamas and my underwear is brand new, too.
<Page25>
"Hisui?"
"Yes, what is it?"
"I'm glad you're concerned about me, but from now on, please do whatever you can to wake me up...changing clothes, you know, is something you have to do yourself."
<Page26>
Embarrassed that it was too late, I couldn't help but avert my gaze. Hisui nods at me with a blank expression.
<Page27>
"Your school uniform is folded over there.
When you are done changing, please come to the living room."
<Page28>
"...Sigh. Normally, I would have noticed this, but was I that tired..."
<Page29>
No amount of reflection is going to change what has happened.
Let's get dressed and have breakfast.
The school uniform is neatly folded and the shirt is well ironed.
When I put my arm through the sleeve, it feels as good as new.
<Page30>
Akiha and Kohaku-san are in the living room.
Akiha seems to have finished her breakfast long ago and is elegantly enjoying tea.
I---
C:>Greet Akiha.
C:>Greet Kohaku-san.
C:>Greet them both.

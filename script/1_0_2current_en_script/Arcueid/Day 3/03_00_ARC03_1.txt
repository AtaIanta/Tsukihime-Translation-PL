Sensei once told me.
The things that my eyes see are the lines that can easily be cut.
To put it in the terms of a human body, it's like a joint that is easily broken,
or like a soft eyeball.
<Page2>
As long as I put my blade and slice through it, no force is required.
With no resistance or friction, anything can be cut.
This doesn't limit to only the human body, but also minerals or anything else applies,
and the 'lines' will evenly appear in my sight.
<Page3>
"Listen carefully, Shiki.
All things have a destiny to break. You can't escape this as long as you have a shape, right?
<Page4>
This means that the world is full of gaps and can be broken at any time.
If there are lines running on the ground as well.
It is possible that one day, for no real reason at all, the ground will split open and everything will break.
At least, in the world I see, there is always that possiblity."
<Page5>
"And we humans are even more fragile.
Injuries and recoveries, aging and growth, rise and fall, are all changes that bring us closer to the end."
<Page6>
When I understood the meaning of this, I thanked sensei for the glasses from the bottom of my heart.
Because I know it. If you always see such lines, you can't live very well.
<Page7>
The fragile lines of things.
A world with no certainty.
Even if you could see it,
there is nothing to be gained by seeing such things-----
<Page8>
"------hmnnn."
I wake up from old memories.
I feel the morning light through my eyelids and crawl my hands under my pillow with my eyes closed.
<Page9>
......huh......my glasses.......?
Feeling uncomfortable, I search the right side of the pillow to see if I can find my glasses, and I was able to easily pick them up.
<Page10>
It's my habit to keep them on the left side of my......pillow, but maybe I had a bad headache last night and didn't have time for that.
<Page11>
"......Ah."
I put on my glasses and then open my eye lids.
If someone is watching, they may think it's a strange habit, but I'd like to refrain from looking at the lines in the morning as much as possible.
<Page12>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama."
"Eek?"
<Page13>
When I turned around by the wall, there was a girl in a maid's uniform standing there.
I didn't notice her because there was no sign of her, but it seems she was there for a long time.
Just like yesterday, she must have came to wake me up so that I wouldn't oversleep.
<Page14>
"I see. I'm sorry, it was strange to be surprised.
Good morning, Hisui. Thank you for coming to wake me up."
<Page15>
"That is my job, so please do not mind me."
<Page16>
Hisui bows her head solemnly.
......And. In the middle of this, she stops moving for a moment, and then raises her head.
<Page17>
"No, it is not that my job is to surprise you.
---I will make every effort not to surprise you tomorrow."
<Page18>
......She's a maid with a subtle sense of humor.
She is not accustomed to socializing, even though she is perfectly capable of performing her duties as a maidservant.
<Page19>
"No, I don't have any problem with you.
It's my fault, I'm still getting used to it."
<Page20>
When I get out of bed, I realize that I have changed into my nightgown.
......Last night, I think it was that howl that made me change into my uniform......when I came back, I fell straight into bed.......?
<Page21>
"......That's weird. I think I slept in my uniform."
<Page22>
"Yes. It is not good for your health if you stayed like that, so I asked Nee-san to come and change you into your nightgown."
<Page23>
Hisui explains the situation to me as if it's natural.
I see. You changed my clothes for me.
Sleeping in your uniform won't make you sick, but it will wrinkle and you'll be more comfortable in your nightgown. As expected of a professional maid, she's very thorough..... wait a minute.
<Page24>
"Changed my clothes?"
I check my pants and underwear.
Both pants and nightwear are brand new.
<Page25>
"Hisui?"
"Yes, what is it?"
"I'm glad you're concerned about me, but from now on, please do whatever you can to wake me up........changing clothes, you know, is something you have to do yourself."
<Page26>
Embarrassed that it was too late, I couldn't help but avert my gaze. Hisui nods at me with a blank expression.
<Page27>
"The school uniform is folded over there.
When you are done changing, please come to the living room."
<Page28>
"......Normally, I would have noticed this, but I was that tired......."
<Page29>
No amount of reflection is going to change what has happened.
Let's get dressed and have breakfast.
The school uniform is neatly folded and the shirt is well ironed.
When I put my arm through the sleeve, it feels as good as new.
<Page30>
Akiha and Kohaku-san are in the living room.
Akiha seems to have finished her breakfast long ago, and is enjoying her tea in an elegant manner.
I...
C:>Greet Akiha.
C:>Greet Kohaku-san.
C:>Greet them both.

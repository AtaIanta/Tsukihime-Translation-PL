After finishing lunch at the cafeteria, I return to the classroom.
As there is still some time before the fifth period, there are only a few boys and girls who remain in the classroom.

"......Huh?#"
I just realized.
I didn't see Yumizuka Satsuki among the girls.
She is the most... well maybe third most conspicuous, and when she's not here, it makes me feel uncomfortable.//目立つので better word needed

"...I wonder if she's absent."
I'm so out of it that I didn't notice until lunchtime.//not sure of the tl 昼休みになって気がつくなんて、我ながら抜けている
The new homeroom teacher didn't say anything about it, so I guess she is just sick today.

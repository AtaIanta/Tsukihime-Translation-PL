After finishing lunch in the cafeteria, I return to the classroom.
As there is still some time before the fifth period, there are only a few boys and girls who remain in the classroom.

"......Huh?#"
I just realized.
I didn't see Yumizuka Satsuki among the girls.
She is the most... well maybe the third most eye-catching girl in the class, and when she's not here, it makes me feel uncomfortable.

"...I wonder if she's absent."
To think I didn't notice until lunchtime, I must be pretty out of it.
The new homeroom teacher didn't say anything about it, so I guess she is just sick today.

...I watch the crowd in front of the station in a daze.
It's a little past two in the afternoon.
The bustle of the city continues unabated.
The large number of people passing by.
I don't know their names or their identities, but each of them is heading towards their own destinations without looking at anyone walking right next to them.
<Page2>
Even though there are so many people here in the same place, everyone sees only one thing.
Like how everyone is their own main character.
They are living each day on their own in which they are the main characters.
<Page3>
Each day they are visible, but they see nothing.
Each day does not intersect and does not branch out anew.
<Page4>
The wisdom to obtain the minimum amount of peace of mind with the minimum amount of effort.
Necessary but uninvolved individualism seems to be the path chosen by humans.
<Page5>
"........"
I'm feeling sentimental because of the slight fever.
"...Let's go home."
I feel calmer now and staying here will only make me indulge in strange thoughts.
<Page6>
I stand up from the bench and blend in with the crowd.
With my thoughts dulled by anemia, I head for the mansion.
For now, I just want to take off my glasses, close my eyes, meditate, and be just like an organ that can only breathe in a room that no one would visit.
@g --- That is, until I crossed paths with that girl.
<Page7>
"------"
@gI thought that time had stopped.
@gEverything in me will remember that moment like I was drawn in.
<Page8>
@g---Throb.
@gGolden hair and red eyes.
@gWhite clothes. White shadow.
@gA snowfield with no footprints.
@gAn unblemished silhouette, reminiscent of a sacred mountain beyond human comprehension.
<Page9>
@g---Throb.
@gMy pulse rises.
@gMy rate fluctuates. 
@gMy veins and arteries activate.
@gMy nerves split one after the other, and my spinal cord heats up in a hallucination.
<Page10>
@gIf I'm saying I was admiring her, I was definitely obsessed.
@gMy feet have already stopped.
@gI look back at the shadow of the girl who has passed out of sight, trying not to lose sight of her.
<Page11>
"---,---------"
@gI find myself forgetting to breathe.
@gI feel nauseous.
@gI can't breathe.
@gI'm suffocating.
@gI just can't remember how to breathe properly.
<Page12>
"---,---------"
@gMy throat is burning.
@gMy eyeballs feel like they're going to shatter.
@gMy palms are wet and slippery.
@gMy blood is running low, and my fingertips are so cold I can't feel them.
@gI'm sweating so much.
<Page13>
@gI remember that the earth is alive.
@gMy breathing restarted on its own.
@gBut the reason----
<Page14>
         I didn't make any mistakes.
         I didn't choose anything.
         I just wanted to go home.
<Page15>
@gReason.
@gI vaguely realized that the tightrope I tricked myself into walking has now been cut.
<Page16>
"Haa----haa-----haa----"
@g...I have to chase her.
@gI have to chase that girl.
@gChase, chase, chase, and then talk.
@gI move my frozen feet.
@gBreathe hotly, like ■■■■.
@gSeeking the figure of the white girl.
<Page17>
"Haa----haa----haa----"
@gThe girl is walking slowly.
@gI'm not interested in any of this at all.
@g---A faint question crossed my mind.
@gNot interested? That's absurd. Is that really the case? But the fact is, I'm not even aware of it. After something. Maybe after something. She's probably very tired. Exhausted. Drained. That's why there is an opportunity. The reason I feel this way is because, when all is said and done, /I'm confident/ that I can ■ her.
<Page18>
@g 	.laughing m'I if as her lick to want I
@gWhen was the last time I satisfied my desire.
@g 		.desired have I as pieces thousand a into apart her tear to want I
@gNot through masturbation or intercourse, but in a simpler, more primal way.
@g 		.her savor can I so down her cut to want I
@gI don't remember. In the first place, I'm still,
@g 		.content s'heart my to her ■ to wait t'can I
@gI don't even remember the "first time".
<Page19>
@g"Haa", I let out a gasp of breath that doesn't sound like my own.
@gI clutch my chest to hold back the boiling emotions.
@gThe girl swimming in the crowd was pure and beautiful, tasteful and pleasant.
<Page20>
"-------"
@gMy throat is aching.
@gI couldn't get my air sacs to work properly at all.
@gWhat's wrong with that? It's only natural.
@gAfter seeing such a ■ sight, it would be rude for a creature to not get excited.
<Page21>
@gI take something out of my bag.
@gI put it in my pocket and start to walk.
@gI feel the touch of iron on my fingertips.
@gWhat luck.
@gThe tools are just perfect.
<Page22>
@gHow wonderful. I'm coming. What a sensual encounter.
@gKeep a good distance.
@gDon't be noticed.
@gDon't let anyone around us get in the way.
@gThat girl and I are complete strangers.
@gSo I have to follow the scent as naturally as possible.
<Page23>
@gThe girl enters an apartment.
@gAn automatic glass door. The security is perfect.
@gNo one can even enter the hall unless they're residents.
@gGoing around to the emergency exit, take off the jacket and leave it in the shade. Switch off. And go inside.
<Page24>
@gThere's no one in the hall.
@gLook at the elevator. The light has stopped at the top floor.
<Page25>
"------"
@gPress the call button. Go inside.
<Page26>
@gAt that moment, I'm overwhelmed by her remaining presence.
@gThe lingering scent of that girl makes my mouth twitch upwards.
<Page27>
@gI'm excited.
@gIn the tight confines of this closed room, I clutched the object in my pocket.
@gShe's right here, near me.
@gNot much longer, I can   her.
<Page28>
@gI get out of the elevator.
@gI sense that there is no one in the hall.
@gOut of the closed room. Heading for the hallway. No one in sight.
@gI can't think.
@gThere is only one word that my brain can think of.
<Page29>
@gGirl.
@gThat girl.
@gI'm going to------
<Page30>
@g---I'm in front of room number three.
@gThis must be it. All the other rooms are empty. Can I be sure? Yes, I can. That kind of sense of smell, if you're alive as an animal, you've got it whether you want it or not. I just forgot about it in my lazy existence. It's shameful. It's unforgivable. There's nothing I can do about it. The rules of civilized society are very gentle and harmless that such a trivial impulse can turn fatal.
<Page31>
"---,-------"
@gI try to press the doorbell but stop.
@gMy glasses are in the way.
@gI can't do anything that I want with these on.
<Page32>
"---Got it?
Don't ever look at things thoughtlessly, okay?"
<Page33>
"....."
@gThere was a woman who told me that a long time ago.
@gBut now I can't remember her name or face.
<Page34>
@gI slowly take off my glasses.
@gThe swirling lines look like aging wrinkles.
<Page35>
@gI don't know what I'm doing.
@gWhat am I trying to do?
@gWhy am I doing this?
@gWhat does Tohno Shiki---want to do with that girl from earlier?
<Page36>
@gI don't know.
@gI don't know, but I press the doorbell.
<Page37>
"Yes---"
@gA voice comes through the door. The door opens.
@gIn a moment.
@gI slip into the room through the small gap.
<Page38>
"Eh----"
@gThe girl raises her voice.
@gOr she tried to.
@gI will never in all eternity hear the voice of the girl who I have such an obsession, such a longing in all my life.
@gBefore I know it, the whole thing is over.
<Page39>
@gThe moment I enter the room, I hear a "kaching", the sound of a hammer falling.
@gThe sound of the door. The creak in my brain. The alarm bell of the end.
@gNone of them. So then, what is it?
@gNeedless to say, there is only one way to do it, 
@gNothing else but a knife unleashed.
<Page40>
@gAt that moment, I pass through the lines running on the girl's body.
@gStab.
@gCut.
@gRight through.
@gRun through.
@gCut her into pieces.
@gCompletely and utterly, I kill her.
<Page41>
@gA total of seventeen lines on the body.
@gNeck, back of head, right eye to lip, right upper arm, right lower arm, right ring finger, left elbow, left thumb, middle finger, left breast, ribs to heart, stomach to the abdomen in two places, left groin, left thigh, left shin, left toe, all of them.
@gPassing through each, without taking even a second.
@gIn truth,   in the blink of an eye,   it's all over.
I dismantled her into seventeen pieces of meat.
<Page42>
"---Eh?"
I hear a stupid, weak voice.
I didn't realize that it came out of my throat.
<Page43>
I feel lightheaded and dizzy.
There are pieces of something scattered in front of me.
On the marble floor, a red liquid spreads out like an overturned bucket of water.
The smell of blood is revolting.
The cuts are very clean, no guts have been spilled out.
<Page44>
Only the red color invades the floor like a wave.
It's a strange story.
There is nothing in the room, just the dismembered limbs of the girl and myself standing there.
<Page45>
"---What the---"
The red erosion is too vivid.
In my hand, I hold the murder weapon, a knife.
<Page46>
"She's---dead."
Of course.
If she's still alive, she's not human.
<Page47>
"Wh---y?"
There's nothing, nothing at all.
Right now, with my own hands.
Didn't I easily dismembered a girl who is a complete stranger to pieces using these hands of mine?
<Page48>
"Did I---kill her?"
Yes, definitely.
Or is that not the case?
I have no reason to. So no, it can't be. But there never was a reason from the start. That's why it's wrong, it can't be right. I'm the only one here. There was another person here a moment ago, but now I'm the only one alive. So no. It has to be. But there's no reason, there's no reason, I didn't want to, I wasn't, I wasn't in my right mind. I was never sane in the first place. So it's not, it's not---
<Page49>
---The red blood spread on the marble floor.
Wet and sticky.
I can feel the red blood on my feet.
<Page50>
".........Ah!"
I lift my shoes in surprise, but not in time.
The girl's red blood sticks to my feet and the floor like coal tar.
<Page51>
"-------"
Aaah. Aah. b..blood, red.
Because I broke her apart, the disgusting color continues to flow sluggishly even now.
<Page52>
"---It's not, me."
Yes, it has to be a mistake.
A mistake. A mistake. Probably a mistake, definitely a mistake.
This must be---
C:>Definitely, this must be some kind of a bad dream.
C:>...No, it's a reality I've created.

I had breakfast in the dining room and went out to the lobby.
Behind me was Hisui, carrying my bag.
I suggested that I can carry my own bag, but she insisted on carrying it to the door at least.
<Page2>
...... I seem to have a weak spot not only for Akiha but also for Hisui.
Oh, well, maybe I'm right, I do have a soft spot for Hisui.
<Page3>
In the case of Akiha, her argument is simply correct, so I lose in legitimacy. It is also true that Akiha Tohno's position is above Shiki Tohno's.
<Page4>
But Hisui is the complete opposite.
I'm in a position of power over Hisui, but I don't think I can use that power to my advantage.
I don't know, when Hisui stares at me, I feel like listening to anything she says.
<Page5>
"Shiki-san, Shiki-san! Please wait a minute!#"
Kohaku-san came down from the second floor with the clatter of her footsteps.
"........................"
Hisui stepped aside as soon as Kohaku-san arrived.
<Page6>
"Hey, weren't you with Akiha?"
"Akiha-sama is on her way to school.
I stayed behind because I have to deliver something to you."
<Page7>
"Something for me?"
"Yes. Yesterday, I received a package from the Arima family."
Kohaku-san smiles at me.
<Page8>
".....But I brought all my stuff with me
The only things that belong to me are the clothes I'm wearing. ......"
<Page9>
"Is that so?  Well, this is the package that was delivered to you."
Kohaku-san hands me a thin wooden box, about twenty centimeters long.
It doesn't weigh much.
<Page10>
"--Kohaku-san. I've never seen this before."
"I'm told it was left to you by your father in his will."
<Page11>
"...... My father left this to me?"
...... I don't know how to feel.
Why would Makihisa Tohno, the man who kicked me out of this house seven years ago, leave me a parting gift?
<Page12>
"Oh well. Kohaku-san take this to my room."
"-----"
Kohaku-san is staring intently at the wooden box.
She seems almost like a child who wants to see a toy.
<Page13>
"Geez"
No, she is a child.
<Page14>
"...... I see. You're curious about what's inside, aren't you, Kohaku-san?"
"No, not at all
I'm just curious as to what kind of gift it is."
...... No, you're curious enough, maid-san.
<Page15>
"Then let's open it. Ready?."
The crate is opened with a soft, dry sound.
Inside there is a thin iron rod, about 15 centimeters long.
<Page16>
"It's ..... an iron rod."
An unadorned, well-worn iron rod.
<Page17>
...... My father must have really hated me to leave me a piece of junk like this.
Besides, the iron bars my father used were a bit thicker and more rugged...
<Page18>
"No, Shiki-san.
This is a fruit knife, isn't it?"
Kohaku-san takes the iron rod out of the box.
<Page19>
"You know, there are knives whose blades pop out.
It's like that. Okay, here we go."
<Page20>
There was a snap, and a blade about ten centimeters long sprung out.
...... I see, this is indeed a knife.
<Page21>
"The blade looks new, but the outside looks very old. Look, the year and era it was made is engraved on the grip.
<Page22>
Kohaku-san retracts the blade and hands me the knife.
...... There is indeed a number engraved on the bottom of the grip.
"The character 'seven', and under it, the character 'night.'
<Page23>
"Nee-san, there's no era by that name.
It says just says "Nanatsu-yoru".
"......!"
When I turned around, I saw Hisui who had been silent until now, peering at the knife from behind.
<Page24>
"Y-You suprised me ...... Don't scare me like that, Hisui.
Here, if you want to see, you don't have to look over my shoulder like that."
<Page25>
"Ah-------"
<Page26>
"Please excuse me.
Um... that dagger was so beautiful, I just couldn't resist"
"Beautiful? I don't know if I'd call it that.
It looks rather dull and old-fashioned."
<Page27>
"No, it's not. I think it's an ancient and venerable sword."
"...... Is that so? It looks like a piece of junk to me. ......
<Page28>
Since Hisui is so adamant about it, I'm starting to feel the same way.
...... Yeah.
Maybe this isn't as bad as a memento.
<Page29>
"'Seven Nights' ...... Maybe that's the name of this fruit knife?"
I don't think many people name their knives...... Whatever it is, it's definitely vintage.
<Page30>
I put the blade away in my bag. It's a violation of the Firearms Act, but I'm hoping they'll tolerate it for one day.
I'll show it off to Arihiko later. ....... Well, that is, if he's at school.
<Page31>
"Shiki-sama. Are you ready to go  ......?"
"Oh, no, I'd better get going. I'll be late.
Okay, Kohaku-san, thanks for the delivery."
"No problem," said Kohaku-san, waving us off.
<Page32>
When I went out of the gate of the mansion, I noticed that there was a lot of noise.
<Page33>
"...... What is it? Isn't it kind of noisy over there?"
"Well, they found some blood on the road this morning."
"Bloodstains......? ...... You mean?"
<Page34>
"Yes, Shiki-sama. There was also blood on the wall of the mansion."
It seems that while you were sleeping, the police came to inquire about what happened last night."
<Page35>
"Does that mean there was a dead body or something ......?"
"No, they only found traces of blood.
"------"
<Page36>
The national road east of the house, that's where I went to check last night.
Bloodstains...... Splattered, caked red.
At that time, there was no such conspicuous color anywhere.
There was only black. Only the biting cold. The warmth of blood was not there.
<Page37>
"Shiki-sama?"
"......... No, it's nothing.
I'll see you later. Thanks for seeing me off."
<Page38>
"Have a good day. Please take care on your way."
<Page39>
Hisui bowed deeply.
I'm just going to school, so I don't need to be careful, but I think she's concerned about my health in her own way.
<Page40>
"Thank you. I'll try to be careful. Take care of yourself, Hisui."
I raised my hand lightly, thanked Hisui, and left the gate of the mansion.

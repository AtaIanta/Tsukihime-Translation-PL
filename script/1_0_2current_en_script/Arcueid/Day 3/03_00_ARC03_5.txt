Fifth period.
The lesson on classical literature is making me sleepy, but I continue writing in my notebook.
Our high school has not yet approved the use of electronic devices for note-taking. The school said that they will eventually move to using tablets, but it seems to be a few years away.
<Page2>
However, the use of mobile devices in class is not discouraged. It's an unspoken agreement.
Even now, some students use their cell phones to read dictionaries, some to exchange emails, and some to browse websites.
I'm more of an analog person myself, so I write the contents of the class by hand like an old-fashioned student.

"――――"
It happened suddenly.
My consciousness intensified like it was accelerating.
A perspective that flips, twists, and flutters toward a point.
A sense of equilibrium as if my brain itself is spinning in circles.
<Page4>
My vision wavers.
I feel that something is coiling at the back of my head and that my consciousness is about to tumble out of my skull.
<Page5>
"...Not, good..."
I know this feeling.
This sudden dizziness is a precursor to anemia.
...How careless of me. I let my guard down, even knowing this could happen to my body at any time.
<Page6>
I hate this... I don't usually collapse in class but―――//not sure about this line
<Page7>
In my darkening vision, I reach out and grab my desk to lean on it.
But it's all in vain.
I can't put any strength into my fingertips.
All that's left is for me to collapse to the floor―――
<Page8>
"Sensei, may I have a word?"
―――And then.
'Smack', someone hits me on the back roughly.
<Page9>
"Tohno's not feeling well, so I'd like to take him to the infirmary."
Before I know it, Arihiko has come up to me.
"Tohno, are you not feeling well?"
I hear the teacher's voice from the podium.
<Page10>
"No, I'm fine like th―――"
"Ah, no, he's not fine at all.
Shouldn't you send him home early?"
...Arihiko says something in a loud voice on his own accord.
<Page11>
"Is that so? The doctor has told me about Tohno's condition too. Tohno, if you're not feeling well, you can rest in the infirmary or leave early and go home."
...Maybe he's a good person after all.
The literature teacher seems to completely believe Arihiko's statements.
<Page12>
"Come now, you can go home now. You look so pale. No one's going to know if you're feeling bad until you tell someone, you know."
Arihiko hits me on the back grumpily.
"...In that case, I'm going to leave early then, Sensei."
'Mmm.' the literature teacher nods solemnly.
<Page13>
"...Sorry, Arihiko. For making you worry like this."
"Don't worry about it. We've been inseparable since middle school so I can tell right away when you're about to collapse from anemia."
<Page14>
Arihiko goes back to his seat.
I manage to get up from my seat and leave the classroom with a heavy feeling in my body.
<Page15>
I leave the school building.
I thought about going to the infirmary to rest, but at this hour there is a high possibility that I would fall asleep until nighttime.
If that's the case, I decided that it would be better to push myself a little and go back to the mansion.
<Page16>
"Phew... I think I'm feeling a little better."
As I breathe in the outside air, I begin to feel rejuvenated.
<Page17>
Seven years ago.
Perhaps, this is the price of recovering from an accident that almost took my life, but since then, I have become predisposed to suffer from chronic anemia.//あれ以降、遠野志貴は慢性的な貧血を起こす体質になっていた needs a rephrasing, left out 体質 for now
<Page18>
When I was first discharged from the hospital, I used to fall ill with anemia every day.
Because of my condition, I missed many things, but thanks to the people around me, nothing serious ever happened.
<Page19>
Now that my body has grown, I don't get dizzy or anemic anymore as long as I don't recklessly strain myself.
Even so, I can't stop myself from getting dizzy and losing consciousness from time to time.
Today I was lucky that Arihiko called out to me in the middle of it, but normally I would have fainted.//途中で声をかけてくれたから needs a recheck
<Page20>
"――――――"
I take a slow, deep breath, letting the fresh air fill my lungs.
While holding back the lingering feeling of stagnation inside my head, I leave the school.
<Page21>
I walk out onto the street in front of the station.
...I can't believe it. This proves that I'm still in a daze.
I almost went into the ticket gate out of habit.
<Page22>
The place I'm going to is not the Arima house. It's the Tohno mansion. There's no need to take the train from here anymore.
<Page23>
"――――Ugh."
I'm still not feeling well.
I put my hand on my forehead and find that it is hotter than usual.
<Page24>
If I push myself too hard and collapse on the side of the road, I'll be even worse off than when I started.
"...I guess there's no choice, really."
I sit down on a bench, disgusted with myself.
I'm going to take a break until I feel better.

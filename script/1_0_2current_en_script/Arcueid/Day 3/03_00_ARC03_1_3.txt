"Good morning, Shiki-san."
Kohaku-san returns my greeting with a smile that couldn't be more appropriate for her white apron.

It's only a little more than a half-hour walk from here to my high school, so I'd say I got up early today."
"In other words, you only have ten minutes for breakfast, have you not? You are not a hungry dog, you should take your time with breakfast."

And then, I remember.
Speaking of dogs, I need to confirm what happened last night.

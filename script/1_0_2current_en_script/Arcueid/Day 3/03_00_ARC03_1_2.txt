"Good morning, Kohaku-san. It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?
"Yes, good morning, Shiki-san."
<Page2>
　Kohaku-san returned my greeting with a big smile on her face.
<Page3>
"Did you sleep well last night?
It's a night in an unfamiliar house, so I was worried that something might go wrong."
<Page4>
"Don't worry, I was just uncomfortable with the height of the ceiling, but the rest is fine. I used to live here, and now I have Kohaku-san to take care of me."
"Oh. You're quite good, Shiki-san."
"No, no. It's a fact."
<Page5>
　I exchanged words with Kohaku-san in a harmonious manner.
In just a few days, I've gotten to know her very well.
It's not that I'm a good communicator, it's the power of Kohaku-san's smile.
　―――and。
<Page6>
　I noticed another gaze silently staring at me from earlier.
"Oh, sh-- ―――#Hi."
I raised my hand lightly in greeting.
Akiha is staring at me, or rather, glaring at me.
<Page7>
"Oh sh? that's not a familiar greeting, Nii-san.
I wonder if there's more to come after that."
"No, there is not. There is nothing after that."
I answer immediately without moving my eyebrows. Or rather, the muscles of my face, not just my eyebrows, were stiffened by tension.
<Page8>
"Good morning, Akiha. Nice day this morning, huh?"
<Page9>
"Oh, you don't have to force yourself to greet me.
Please, ignore me. It seems like you want to have a nice morning with Kohaku.
If you like each other so much, would you like to have Kohaku as your maid then?"
<Page10>
"...... You've been on full throttle all morning, haven't you?"
My sister's power is amazing.
As her brother, it was logical for me to greet my sister first .......
<Page11>
"Akiha-sama, please don't tease Shiki-san too much. We don't have much time, and he hasn't finished breakfast yet."
<Page12>
"The reason he's not finished with his breakfast is because he woke up late. It's his own fault that his mornings are so rushed."
Akiha sniffed.
In the first place, she was not happy that I did not show up until this time.
<Page13>
"Kohaku-san. Is breakfast ready for me?
"Yes, I'm all set. I'm ready when you are, just ask.
<Page14>
"No, Kohaku. It's already this late, and you don't have time for breakfast. You'll be late for school."
<Page15>
"No, no, no, no. No, no, no. It's just after 7:00 a.m., so there's plenty of time.
It's only a thirty-minute walk from here to my school.
"So you only have 10 minutes for breakfast? You're not a hungry dog, you should take your time with breakfast."
<Page16>
"Mm, guh--"
She was right on target with my inadequacies. ...... I must say, she has terrific reaction speed and reflexes.
It's like a wall that keeps repelling the ball in tennis practice. 
<Page17>
"Nii-san .......
Did I just say something weird?"
"No, nothing. Really, nothing.
I'm not a dog, Akiha..."
<Page18>
　And then I remembered.
speaking of dogs, I need to confirm what happened last night.

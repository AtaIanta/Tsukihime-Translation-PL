...It doesn't seem like she's willing to give up.
Or rather, if she gets any closer, it will definitely end up in a fight. In that case, there's no doubt that I'm going to be the one that's pushed down.
<Page2>
"Geez, I get it, here!
...Listen. Give it back as soon as you're done looking at it."
<Page3>
I hand the glasses over to Arcueid.
She closely inspects it in great detail.
...And then,
<Page4>
"Shiki. This person that gave you this, is she still in this city?"
"...I don't think so. It was seven years ago, and she didn't seem like the kind of person who stays in one place."
<Page5>
"―――I see. Good, it would be a bother to deal with another opponent.
...Although it would be safer to not deal with Blue in the first place."
Arcueid falls silent with a serious face.
<Page6>
"Arcueid. You know Sensei... no, the person who made these glasses...?"
<Page7>
"I do. She is one of the four magicians that exist in this world.
These glasses are an extraordinary piece of work. I wouldn't be able to break them with my current strength, although I am not very strong right now."
Arcueid's face grows more serious.
<Page8>
"...Wait, were you planning to break them?"
"―――Huh?
Did I say something like that?"
<Page9>
"...So you were planning to break them."
'Give them back,' I said, taking the glasses back from Arcueid.
<Page10>
"Geez. You were the one who said I'd go insane without these glasses.
Or are telling me that you want me to go crazy?"
<Page11>
"It's not like that or anything.
It's just that I didn't like how much you cherished that thing."
"........"
I have no idea what goes through a vampire's head.
This woman must be trying to destroy my life, in one way or another.
<Page12>
"...Whatever, just don't get any more crazy ideas.
The memories of Sensei are precious to me, but more than that, I wouldn't be able to live without them. If I get headaches from seeing these lines all the time, who knows what will happen to my head."

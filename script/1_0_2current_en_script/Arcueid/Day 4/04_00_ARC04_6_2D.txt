"Well, I guess it's my turn now.
To tell you the truth, I forgot to ask you something important too."
"...? What do you mean, surely there's nothing to ask me. I am nothing like a vampire, just a simple student."
<Page2>
"Hmm. Then let me ask you something, Shiki.
If that's the case, how on earth did you kill me?"
"What?"
<Page3>
"I'm asking you what kind of method did you use to kill me.
My antibodies can render secret arts like Runes and Kabbalah to be useless, yet somehow you managed to nullify it――― The only magic I haven't experienced yet are the ancient Shintoism of this country and the hidden treasures of South America."
<Page4>
"No, even those wouldn't be able to reach such an extent as to outright 'kill' me.
Answer me, Shiki. What kind of ancient magic did you use to incapacitate me?"
<Page5>
"Hold on, what do you mean when you say 'ancient magic'?"
I can tell that Arcueid is being serious.
But I don't understand what she's trying to say at all.
<Page6>
"I'm talking about a Conceptual Weapon.
A catalyst for storing history and ideas.
There are magical artifacts in this country too, right? Although they are mostly Buddhist staves, swords and formal attire like jewels and masks――― Hey, Shiki, are you sure you're not one of those people?"
<Page7>
"I already told you, I'm just a regular student. I don't know anything about those kinds of things."
<Page8>
"You're lying. There's no way that a human that's not a mage would be able to hurt me.
...Shiki, there's something that you're hiding from me, isn't there?"
<Page9>
Arcueid glares at me like an angry cat.
But even if she looks at me like that, I have nothing to tell her―――――
―――Wait, there is.
<Page10>
"...Sorry. To tell you the truth, there might be something.
.....But I'm not sure if it's relevant here."
<Page11>
Arcueid continues to glare at me.
This is a situation that can't be resolved without being open.
<Page12>
"I don't how to explain it... but I can see lines in things that can be cut."
"Lines that can be cut?"
I know, right? Normally people wouldn't believe me when I tell them this.
In fact, it has always been that way.
<Page13>
"...What do you mean by that?"
Arcueid asks back in all seriousness.
<Page14>
"What I'm saying is that I can see the lines where things can be cut.
Whether it's a living thing or a surface, as long as I can touch it, then it can be cut. It's like a crack, and if I run a blade through it, it will easily split into two.... does this make any sense?"
<Page15>
"It's convenient to be able to cut steel with a knife, but it doesn't mean that I can cut wherever I want. I can only cut areas where a line is visible, so I wouldn't be able to use it for things like carpentry.
Like the time I sliced you... well, you could see that I could cut a woman's skin with a knife, right?"
<Page16>
"――――――"
"....."
A chill runs down my spine.
From the opposite side, she looks at me with such a strong gaze that I stop breathing.
<Page17>
"I see. I thought the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception only existed in fairy tales, but I guess they do exist.
Mutated monsters like you, for example."
<Page18>
"Wha... what are you talking about? A vampire-like you has no right to call me a monster!"
"A monster is a monster. No one, not even us, possesses the Mystic Eyes that can see the death of things."
<Page19>
"...? The death, of things...?"
"What else could it be?
Shiki. Your eyes must have a connection to a place that should not be connected to any living thing.... Are those eyes something you were born with?"
"...No, they've been like this for a long time, but they're not innate."
<Page20>
"In that case, you must have experienced death at least once before, right?"
"I'm not like you, so it's not like I can just simply die.
...But yes, I have. I almost died in an accident once. It was only after that that I began to see those lines."
<Page21>
"Hmm. You must have had some sort of latent power, but I suppose it was the incident that awakened it... Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, huh.
If that's the case, then there's no doubt that you would be able to kill me."
<Page22>
Behaving like a spoiled child in a bad mood, Arcueid averts her gaze from me.
I'm grateful that she's no longer looking at me with those clearly disgusted eyes.
<Page23>
"Arcueid... Do you know what those lines are?"
"I can't tell you what you're feeling as well as you can, but I can try to explain it based on my own knowledge."
<Page24>
"What you are seeing is the end of all things, the spots where things easily die. Or to put it more simply, the time in which all things end... otherwise known as 'death' itself."
"――――"
<Page25>
That's....
...A little different from my understanding, but it's close to what Sensei who gave me these glasses taught me as a child.
<Page26>
...The end of all things. The future of things.
Until now, without realizing it,
I've been trying so hard not to be aware of this fact―――
<Page27>
"...What are you talking about? These lines that I see, aren't they just things that I can cut?"
<Page28>
"Like I said, those lines are 'death' itself.
Listen to me, Shiki. Every single thing in this world has an end.
While their time of death may be different from each other, in any case, these things must come to an end.
Death is not something that comes, it is something that is included in the moment of birth and becomes manifested at some point. It is simple cause and effect. You've heard of the law of causality, haven't you?"
<Page29>
"If we were to go by that, everything that has a beginning must have an end. The flow of atoms, that's conservation of energy, right? The system will not tolerate a single irregularity, not even the smallest error.
I mean, if such a thing existed, the whole premise of this universe would collapse. It would disappear like a bubble."
<Page30>
No, even if that's true.
Isn't talking about the death of the universe a bit over the top?
<Page31>
"It's not over the top at all!
I'm not kidding when I say that your eyes really are that bad!"
"――――――"
<Page32>
"Listen. It is a pre-determined fate of all things to become annihilated.
Even the strongest and the longest life has this rule. Even if there is a life that has a life span longer than the lifespan of the universe, it doesn't mean that it will keep living forever."
<Page33>
"This pre-determined 'annihilation' is the 'death' of all things.
And since it's always been there, it's not impossible to see it with your eyes if you have the ability to understand the concept of 'death' and if your brain and eyes are connected by circuits."
<Page34>
"That is the true nature of the 'lines' that you see.
If I were to theorize it in your way, I'd say it's something close to a pre-determined flaw in the atomic bonds.
Or maybe it's more like a <self-destructive|telomere> switch in the genes that manifests the cause of the individual's death."
<Page35>
"Anyway, what you're seeing is the line where things can easily die, the conclusion of death itself.
I don't know how you've been able to live all this time in such a state. You must have had a very tranquil mind, Shiki."
<Page36>
Arcueid speaks plainly.
"――――――"
You got to be kidding me, I don't even know what to say.
While I do understand her explanation, I don't want to agree with any of it.
<Page37>
"There's no way something like that exists, much less something that I can see."
<Page38>
"But you can see it.
Normally, a creature would be killed if you cut off its head. It would stop moving since it was decapitated after all.
Conversely, you would say that a creature that can't be decapitated is unkillable.# Oh, well, I'm the exception to that rule so let's just ignore that."
<Page39>
"What I'm trying to say is that you can defy that rule.
Even if you are dealing with an opponent that nullifies every external factor, you will kill it first. An opponent that is killed must be in a 'dead' state afterward, right?
It's not that you were able to kill it because you severed them.
In your case, you kill the thing, and thus, the object becomes severed as a result."
<Page40>
"See, if that's not a monster, then what is?
You say that it's just a line that can be cut, but those two eyes are more unique than any other ability that has ever existed until now.
You know, Shiki. You have the ability to kill everything around you, it's as if you have the eyes of the Grim Reaper."
<Page41>
"........."
...It's true.
That's why I've been trying not to be aware of it, and not to acknowledge it until now.
<Page42>
The truth is that I've known this for a very long time.
Just like Arcueid said, these eyes and this life can't be anything but some kind of mistake in this world.
<Page43>
Because ever since that day, I've been shown the end of the world.
I've been shown the possibility that everything could fall apart in a second.
As long as I'm alive, I'm surrounded by it.
There were so many signs of death all around me.
<Page44>
"...But now what.
Then that means I can kill even someone like you. I can kill anything, because I'm a dangerous guy after all."
"Really? Then let's give it a try."
<Page45>
Arcueid turns off the lights in the room and moves to the window.
The curtains are opened.
The abundance of isolated light along with the numerous information enters my field of view.
The moonlight passing through the window creates a shadow of a white girl.
<Page46>
"Come on, it's fine so don't hold back.
Oh, could those glasses be preventing you from seeing it by any chance?"
<Page47>
"―――It's okay, right?"
...Impossible.
I put my hand on my glasses, which I've never taken off in public before.
<Page48>
...I guess I've fallen into despair after taking in Arcueid's accusations.
The violent feelings push me to take off my glasses.
<Page49>
Lines start to wriggle around the room.#    #...The world become full of signs of death#.
<Page50>
"―――――――――――#Eh?"
What stood before me was a miracle that made me doubt my very own eyes.
<Page51>
Outside the window was a white moon.
The lines that were difficult to look at during the day in the blazing sun,
were seen with ease through just the faint illumination of the moon.
<Page52>
Among them.
The 'lines' on Arcueid's body were so thin and insubstantial that I have to fully concentrate to see them. It was a peculiar sight to behold.
<Page53>
"But――― how?"
<Page54>
"What do you think? The lines are almost invisible, aren't they?
During the night, I am a creature without a fixed time of death.
So it would be almost impossible to kill me even with those eyes of yours."
<Page55>
"Mmm, but even with that, I suppose you could still see a small glimpse.
Although I cannot die at night, I can still be killed during daytime more or less. Because of that weak point, I was able to be killed by you. There is also the fact that I had just finished a big task that time, which made my resistance to instant death lower."
<Page56>
"As a result, I was killed by your hands, and as you can see, I've grown weak to the point where I could 'die' even at night.
In other words, although I am no longer immortal, Shiki, would you be able to cut the lines on my body?"
<Page57>
"――――"
...I wonder.
It's true that I can cut anything if a line exists.
But I don't think I'll be able to cut it as brilliantly as I did back then in less than a second.
<Page58>
"I think it will be hard to do... The lines keep appearing and disappearing, so I could only do it while you are asleep."
<Page59>
"I know, right? That there is your biggest flaw.
No matter how much you see 'death', it would be meaningless if you can't reach those 'lines' with your own hands.
No matter how weak I get, my physical ability would never reach the point where you can catch me."
<Page60>
...I see.
Now that she mentions it, I wouldn't be able to keep up with a fast-moving animal, let alone catch it.
If I can't even catch a target, then touching its lines would be out of the question.
<Page61>
In other words, even if I can see these 'lines', it doesn't mean that I can kill a moving target.
Through those words, the non-human thing laughed away the sense of fear that surrounded him to the point of feeling relief.
<Page62>
Yes, it's a funny story. A joke that brings me a sense of comfort.
No matter what metaphors or what flaws I get taught, the world that I've been looking at my whole life will not change.
I'm a broken part of this world that should not be allowed to mix with it.
<Page63>
Yeah, but even so――――
I see unimaginable things before me,
that such obvious things become unimportant.
<Page64>
A large flower glistening in the moonlight.
...That's right. It's not that I want eternity.
It's that I wanted to live holding on to the hope.
The hope that even a person like me could feel something―――
<Page65>
"―――Ow."
I felt a headache emerging.
Looking at all these lines gives me a headache. I put on my glasses, switching from the miraculous scene to my original view.
<Page66>
"........"
Arcueid is staring at me with suspicion.
<Page67>
"...What is it? Is there something else you want to say?"
<Page68>
"No, it's not like that.
Do you not see the lines if you wear those glasses?"
<Page69>
"...Well, yeah.
It was given to me by a person I met a long time ago when my eyes started acting like this.
Nowadays I only use the lenses, but thanks to these, I'm somehow able to lead a normal life."
<Page70>
"Is that so? I see.
No matter how strong your mind is, you would go insane or destroy your eyes if you had to look at death all the time."
<Page71>
"...But you know. You've been doing nothing but throw out disturbing things for a while now. At the very least give me a break. Also, you're close. Stop. Just stop right there. I'll throw a vase at you if you don't stop!"
<Page72>
Sensing danger, I back away.
However, with my threat having no effect on the big cat in front of me, Arcueid continues to approach me with deep curiosity.
<Page73>
"Hey. Those glasses, let me see it."
"―――No way. These are important to me, I'm not handing it over."
<Page74>
"It's not like I'm not going to break it.
Come on. It's okay if I just take a look at it, right?"
<Page75>
What kind of stupid nonsense is she saying...
I――――
C:>Give up and hand it over.
C:>...No, I'm not handing it over.

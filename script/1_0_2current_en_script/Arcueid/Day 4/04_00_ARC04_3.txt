<Page1>
"Have a nice day."
As usual, I was seen off by Hisui as I left the main gate.
<Page2>
.....but this time.
Hisui stared at me, then took a small breath as if making up her mind and continued speaking.
<Page3>
"......Shiki-sama. What did you do yesterday?"
<Page4>
" It was nothing. I got sick at school, had to leave early, and was on my way back here..."
---On my way?
"I was just resting in the park.
　...... But it was indeed thoughtless, as Akiha said. I'll be careful from now on."
<Page5>
"I'm not blaming you.
...... This morning, you seemed to be overexerting yourself.
Please take care on the road."
<Page6>
Such words alone must have been too much for Hisui.
She gave me a deep bow and sent me on my way.
<Page7>
As I approached the school, I saw more and more people wearing school uniforms.
The time was 7:45.
Everyone was taking it easy, probably because there was plenty of time before HR.
<Page8>
Of course, I am one of them.
This morning I can start my day as usual, without any worries about being late, without any worries about anything.
<Page9>
As soon as I passed the intersection, I was at the main gate.
The traffic light turns red, and I stop in front of the crosswalk.
Beyond the crosswalk is the wall of the school.
The path to the school is protected by a guardrail, and students are heading towards the school gate.
<Page10>
At this time of the day, the only people on the sidewalk are students from our school.
That is how it's usually is.
But in between the hurrying cars, I thought I saw a white figure.
<Page11>
"Wha-----"
There she was.
A white figure, unmistakable.
Golden hair that reminded me of sunlight.
Long, thin eyebrows and red eyes.
I've only seen her once, but there's no way I could mistake her for anyone else.
<Page12>
"------"
But it can't be.
Because that girl was torn to pieces by my hands yesterday.
<Page13>
"------"
No, even that's a lie.
Hisui, Akiha and even Kohaku-san told me that it was just a bad dream.
"------"
I don't need them to tell me.
<Page14>
It's just a story that I wanted to believe myself.
So it was not a dream, but reality.
I killed her.
I killed her. 
I killed her.
I definitely killed her...
<Page15>
"-------Ha-a"
But then.
How could that thing...
How could it be there?
How could that thing be right in front of me, in reality......?
<Page16>
The traffic light turns green.
The students around me walked to the other side.
I was the only one who stood still and stunned.
The girl sits on the guardrail, her legs swinging aimlessly.
<Page17>
She looked as if she was waiting for something or someone.
I had no idea how long she was waiting, but there was nothing grim about her expression.
<Page18>
---I wonder who she is waiting for.
She was fidgety and restless, as if she was waiting for her lover.
<Page19>
...... No, hold on. Waiting?
...... waiting for someone?
Obvious. That much is obvious.
I'm sure I would do the same.
Infact everyone would do the same.
If I'd been killed.
I don't have to think about who I want to see first.
<Page20>
---I have a bad feeling about this.
A chill runs down my spine, like a centipede crawling.
My spine feels like it's going to burst out of my mouth.
<Page21>
The girl in white looked at me.
Our gazes meet. The intentions match. Everything makes sense.
No. That's just a coincidence. It must be just a coincidence.
There is no feeling. There is no connection. There is no relationship.
<Page22>
She's just a stranger who looks like her.
She must be waiting for someone else.
Otherwise, this moment is a nightmare.
Because there is no way that a dead person, a person who has been dismembered like that, can be alive.
<Page23>
And yet, a living girl looked at me and smiled.
"You're finally here," she said.
She seemed deeply satisfied to have found the person who had killed her.
<Page24>
The girl raised her hand and smiled friendly, then sat up from the guardrail.
She ruffled her hair and came towards me as I stood there.
<Page25>
"What the hell is ------ that?"
A bad dream.
The light turns red.
<Page26>
"Don't come ----, don't come---, don't come---"
The girl didn't seem to care and came across the road in a straight line as cars came and went.
<Page27>
She's only three meters away.
I don't know if this is a dream or reality.
"I told you not to come here, so...!"
<Page28>
No matter how loud I shouted, the reality in front of me remained the same.
So I just ran away from the white girl.
<Page29>
I ran.
I ran as fast as I could.
Without any sense of shame or honor, I kept running as fast as I could along the asphalt road, pushing past people passing by.
<Page30>
"Hah, hah, hah, ha, -----!"
My breathing was uneven and my heart was pounding.
But I still ran.
My face didn't look like normal anymore.
<Page31>
My vision was distorted by tears. My throat was burning. My lungs shriveled.
The muscles in my hands were about to tear from shaking so much.
<Page32>
Both of my legs kicked the ground in a futile, uncontrolled manner. Every time I took a step, I felt a numb pain in my thigh.
But that was okay. I didn't care if my legs were shredded.
Because if I didn't run, I was going to go crazy.
<Page33>
I look behind me.
A girl in white is walking towards me.
She's definitely following me.
The girl I killed is chasing me.
That was more than enough reason for the frenzy.
<Page34>
"Hah, hah, hah ------!"
I ignore my exploding heart and keep running.
I turned around and saw the girl.
She's chasing me, her footsteps as light as a feather.
<Page35>
"Ha, ha, ha!" 
My chin went up.
My arms are limp.
My legs have long since lost all feeling.
So why can't I shake off a person who's just walking around when I'm running as fast as I can?
<Page36>
"Ha, ha, ha. ----"
My breath hitched.
I'm not sure how many kilometers I've already run at my top speed.
But when I look back, I see her walking towards me.
It was a natural, strolling gait, and she never left me.
It's like a ghost burned into the rearview mirror.
<Page37>
"......... hah, hah, ha, ha, ha."
I laughed, even though it wasn't funny, I still ran while laughing.
<Page38>
"Ha ha ha ha ahahahahahahahaha!"
I couldn't stop laughing.
But I still ran, and even though my body was screaming at me that I would die if I ran any further, I still ran.
<Page39>
The reason for running was obvious.
If she catches up to me, she'll kill me for sure.
I laughed it off, but I knew better than anyone that it was just a comforting thought.
<Page40>
There is no need for any reason or rationale.
This is the natural rule, everyone knows the cause and effect.
<Page41>
If I kill her, she kills me.
Since I killed her, she has the right to kill me.
So...
It's just a fact that my life will end the moment I'm cornered.
<Page42>
"Ah..."
I fell to the ground in disarray.
It's not that my legs got tangled up, but that I couldn't move my arms and legs one more step and fell forward.
<Page43>
"A....aa, Haa......h"
　I crawled over to the edge of the wall and managed to reach it.
<Page44>
I put my hands on the wall and tried to stand up, but it was no use.
As soon as I stood up, my knees lost their strength and I fell on my butt with a thud.
As it was, my body wouldn't move anymore.
<Page45>
"Ha--- ha, ha---"
I look up and breathe in.
---It was painful.
I don't have enough oxygen at all.
Thanks to this, I can't think clearly.
I can't even make sense of what I'm doing.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
I don't know why, why, why the girl I killed is still alive.
<Page46>
I killed that girl.
I killed her in the most extreme way imaginable.
So how could she wait for me in front of the school and smile at me like that?
<Page47>
"...... I killed you, I swear."
---Yes, I did.
I killed her.
I Killed Her.
I KILLED HER.
　Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
　Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
　Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why ------?
<Page48>
"Hey, are we done playing tag?"
Click.
A dry sound echoed in the back alley.
<Page49>
She came in with a light step, shrugged her shoulders in disappointment, and leaned against the wall as if to say
"Hello. Thank you so much for your hospitality yesterday.
She gave me a big, carefree smile.
<Page50>
".........!"
I feel like I'm going crazy.
I don't know why she's making that face.
The girl, with a smile on her face, nonchalantly and carelessly walks into this closed alleyway.
<Page51>
"And here's something you forgot.
I don't like it when people drop things that can be used as evidence."
<Page52>
A black object was tossed into the air.
It was my bag, which I hadn't even realized I had dropped until this point.
<Page53>
No, wait, what did she just say.....?
Evidence? Evidence of what exactly......?
<Page54>
"No---run, run, run ......!"
I moved my feet with that thought, but there was a concrete wall behind me, and I couldn't escape any further back.
<Page55>
"Hmm? I thought we were done playing tag.
Because this is a narrow alley. In addition, it's not very popular, so there's no need to worry about anyone getting in the way.
<Page56>
The girl kept smiling, as if she was very happy.
......narrow alley? Not popular?
I looked around in a panic and was disgusted by my own stupidity.
Running into a place like this is like asking for your own death. ......!
<Page57>
"It's been a long time.
Eighteen hours later, I finally caught you.
With a clunk, the girl took another step into the alleyway.
<Page58>
"You....you're ----
"What?"
"You are, definately ----
<Page59>
"Yeah. I'm the girl you killed yesterday.
I'm glad you remember me."
It was a reply I didn't want to hear, whether it was a lie or the truth.
<Page60>
"Don't be ridiculous. A person who's dead can't possibly be alive!"
"Yeah, but that's not so surprising, is it?
It's just that they were killed and then came back to life."
<Page61>
The girl replied simply and made a clattering sound.
The distance gets shorter and shorter.
<Page62>
"...... came back... to life?"
I bite down on the girl's words, stunned.
You've come back to life ......?
In other words, you've recovered from near-death? So you went to a doctor and after surgery  you were revived ...... from that state?
<Page63>
"Don't be ridiculous!
There's no way anyone can come back to life after being dismembered like that. ......!
<Page64>
"Yes. Because I'm not human."
"-----what?"
The implications of the girl's words were, well, too simple to be interpreted differently.
<Page65>
I am not a human being.
That's what the girl in front of me said.
<Page66>
"You're not ...... human.......?
"Of course not. Do you think there are people who can regenerate themselves after being torn apart limb from limb?"
"-------."
There is no way a human can do that.
If there is such a thing, it is a completely different creature that only resembles a human being.
<Page67>
Even if you kill it, it will come back.
Even if you stop it from breathing, it will come back to life.
Even if you tear it apart, it will come back to life and start moving again.
It's a thing in the shape of a person, but it can't be called a person.
<Page68>
"-------Ha..........."
That seemed to be the true identity of the girl in front of me.
I tried to raise my voice to laugh, but my thirsty throat was so parched that I couldn't even smile properly.
<Page69>
"....What in the....."
Even if it's a funny, it's not good for me.
It is too much of a coincidence to be laughed at.
<Page70>
Because, I know.
If this girl is not human, it might make sense that she is still alive even though she was killed.
<Page71>
"Ha ...... ha, ha ......."
The core of my head calms down.
I remember the words of a certain person who saved me when I was a child.
For now, take a good look.
It's a situation that requires a lot of thinking afterwards, this.
<Page72>
"You said you aren't human.
What are you then?"
<Page73>
"Me?　#I'm a vampire."
To put it simply, I'm a monster that lives off of human blood."
<Page74>
......good.
What's good about it is that the word vampire is easy to understand in its own way.
<Page75>
I know what a vampire is.
Even though it's a myth, the word "vampire" is popular and famous.
It was created by the novelist Bram Stoker. A "non-dying" monster in human form, spoken of as fiction in the Western world.
<Page76>
Secondly, and most importantly, the name alone gives you an idea of what they are.
A blood-sucking demon. Since she calls herself a demon, it is only natural that she is not human.
<Page77>
"I see, vampires.....wha---"
It was so out of blue that I almost laughed.
Even though I was going to be killed right after this, it made me feel better.
I'm not sure why, but I feel like I don't care anymore.
<Page78>
The girl looks down at me with a satisfied look, as if she's happy to see me in such a sorry state, having thrown everything away.
<Page79>
.....but, I thought the common belief was that vampires couldn't walk in the daytime.
Well, that's really a minor issue now.
<Page80>
".....so
What does a monster want from me?"
<Page81>
I get desperate and tell her off.
For some reason, the girl backed away.
It was only for a moment, and she immediately folded her hands in front of her chest and gave me a scowl.
<Page82>
"I'm surprised. Have you forgotten what you did to me yesterday?
You killed me, a complete stranger, in pieces the moment you saw me. So what do you want from me, you seem to be quite skilled at your job."
<Page83>
The girl seemed to be more dismayed than angry.......
But now I feel the same way.
After all, the girl I killed with my own hands is saying to me, " Why did you kill me?"
<Page84>
"Hey. Are you listening, you homicidal maniac?"
"...... Yeah, I'm listening. I'm just trying to wrap my head around the fact that I've had some pretty bad luck.
I'm sorry, but I need you to shut up for a second."
<Page85>
Or rather, I want to hit something.
Otherwise, I might even commit suicide.
<Page86>
At this point in my life, I realize how bad my luck is.
There was a girl I suddenly felt like killing for no reason.
I let my momentum get the better of me and killed her.
<Page87>
After that, my memory was vague, and I turned my back on it, thinking it was a dream, but it turned out to be true, and in addition, the person I killed was not human.
I've always called myself defective and unfit, but compared to this situation, everything else can be called is normal......
<Page88>
After that, I went through a lot of trouble and desperation.
But then, when I decided to make amends in my own way...
I found out that the person I killed wasn't even human!
<Page89>
"---------ha, haha."
I can't help but laugh.
..... but it's not all that bad.
<Page90>
Because the person I killed has come back to life, that means I didn't kill anyone.
The act of "killing" remains, but she is alive.
I think that's something to be really happy about.
<Page91>
...... Yes. I can, I can do this.
Tohno Shiki can go back to his normal life as before.
<Page92>
But instead, I'm being hunted down by some monster......still that's a lot better than being a murderer.
Bad luck is bad luck, but this is probably incredibly bad luck.
If this is so ridiculous, then I''m not the only one who's crazy.
<Page93>
"...... Okay, I'm calm.
You have something to say, don't you?　Go ahead, say what you want, whether it's a complaint or a grudge."
<Page94>
"There's a lot I want to say, but ...... you're a strange one. What's with the attitude in front of the vampire?
"I'm sorry, I'm desperately trying to stay sane. ......If I don't do that, I might kill myself."
<Page95>
I'm already in the mindset of, "If you're going to kill me, kill me.
I've been dealing with an abnormal body type for seven years.
No matter how horrible the event is, I am prepared to accept the fact that it is true as long as it happened in front of me.
However, I never dreamed that such a case existed.
<Page96>
"Hmmm. ........."
The girl stared at me.
Her gaze was sharp, but there was no hostility in it.
<Page97>
...... It's strange. I'm sure it's a universal rule that if you get hit, you hit back. I'm sure this girl is itching to kill me too. ......?
<Page98>
"...... What are you staring at?
I know you're here to get revenge on me. Then..."
<Page99>
"Yes, it's true that if someone kills you, the rule of thumb is to kill them back.
If that's what you want, I'll do it, but for now, I think I'll pass. It doesn't balance out."
The girl looks at me straight in the face.
<Page100>
"Hey, are you sorry?"
"...... What?"
<Page101>
For a moment, my eyes lit up.
The girl had said something that sounded out of place.
<Page102>
"I'm asking if you're sorry for killing me, and if you are, I'll forgive you.
You don't seem like a very good liar for a human."
<Page103>
"Are you......talking about me?"
"Yes. As long as you say you're sorry, that's all that matters to me."
<Page104>
---Unbelievable.
<Page105>
What was unbelievable was not that she forgave the person who killed her, but...
It was the fact that this girl's voice sounded so gentle.
<Page106>
" Ugh. I'm asking you a serious question, so you should answer properly.
Come on, answer quickly. Are you feeling sorry for what you've done or not?
If you don't make that clear, we can't move any further."
<Page107>
---Am I feeling sorry for what I did?
I don't need to be reminded of that.----
<Page108>
".................. That's..."
As I was about to say the rest, something made me pause.
You can't do that.
The moment you say it, you'll never be able to return to your former blindness.
It's a good idea to keep your eyes peeled and pretend to be normal without noticing anything.
<Page109>
" 'That's' what?"
-------------
<Page110>
My throat clenches.
Don't say that, I fear.
But...
<Page111>
.......but it is unavoidable.
Some things you just cannot run away from.
There was someone who believed in me that way.
<Page112>
If I wish to be free,
From the sins I've committed,
From the actions I took,
I can't just turn my back on this.
<Page113>
"That's.......right, I regret it.
No matter what, I've killed someone."
<Page114>
I confessed as I squirmed.
As soon as I spilled the words, there was no stopping it.
I accepted that ...... this was it, I was screwed.
<Page115>
Yes, I did. I killed her.
Mercilessly, for no reason at all.
I just did it for myself.
<Page116>
"...... I can regret and reflect on that.
......if I can."
If I' m allowed to take such an easy way out.
"I will bow to you, ...... as many times as you want.
......, but it's meaningless.
The fact is, I killed you. So..."
<Page117>
There is no way I can be forgiven.
It's not acceptable to say, "It doesn't matter because she's alive again."
I killed this girl in front of me.
It is the ultimate act of extortion.
It's a violence that can't be quantified any further.
<Page118>
"So you can have your revenge on me.
...... I didn't run away because I was afraid of you. I was only running away from my own actions."
I kept my head down.
I muttered these words to myself without repenting to anyone.
<Page119>
...... Then, I finally woke up.
It was like I had been in a dream since yesterday.
<Page120>
A dream before the end.
The escape from a reality that I kept running from for my own despicability.
And now, at last, the retribution...

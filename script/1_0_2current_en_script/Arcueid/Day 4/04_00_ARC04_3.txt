<Page1>
"Have a nice day."
As usual, I'm seen off by Hisui as I leave the main gate.
<Page2>
.....but this time.
Hisui stares at me, then takes a small breath as if making up her mind and continues speaking.
<Page3>
"......Shiki-sama. What did you do yesterday?"
<Page4>
"It was nothing. I got sick at school, had to leave early, and was on my way back here..."
---On my way?
"I was just resting in the park.
......but it was indeed thoughtless, as Akiha said. I'll be careful from now on."
<Page5>
"I am not blaming you.
......this morning, you seemed to be overexerting yourself.
Please take care on the road."
<Page6>
Such words alone must have been too much for Hisui.
She gives me a deep bow and sends me on my way.
<Page7>
As I approach the school, I see more and more people wearing school uniforms.
The time is 7:45.
Everyone is taking it easy, probably because there is plenty of time before HR.
<Page8>
Of course, I'm one of them.
This morning I can start my day as usual, without any worries about being late, without any worries about anything.
<Page9>
As soon as I pass the intersection, I reach the main gate.
The traffic light turns red, and I stop in front of the crosswalk.
Beyond the crosswalk is the school wall.
The path to the school is protected by a guardrail, and students are heading towards the school gate.
<Page10>
At this time of the day, the only people on the sidewalk are students from our school.
That is how it's usually is.
But in between the hurrying cars, I think I see a white figure.
<Page11>
"Wha-----"
There she is.
A white figure, unmistakable.
Golden hair that reminds me of sunlight.
Long, thin eyebrows and red eyes.
I've only seen her once, but there's no way I could mistake her for anyone else.
<Page12>
"------"
But it can't be.
Because that girl was torn to pieces by my hands yesterday.
<Page13>
"------"
No, that's a lie.
Hisui, Akiha and even Kohaku-san told me that it was just a bad dream.
"------"
I don't need them to tell me.
<Page14>
It's just a story that I wanted to believe myself.
So it was not a dream, but reality.
I killed her.
I killed her. 
I killed her.
I definitely killed her...
<Page15>
"-------Ha-a"
But then.
How could that thing...
How could it be there?
How could that thing be right in front of me, in reality......?
<Page16>
The traffic light turns green.
The students around me are walking to the other side.
I'm the only one who is standing still and stunned.
The girl sits on the guardrail, her legs swinging aimlessly.
<Page17>
She looks as if she's waiting for something or someone.
I have no idea how long she has been waiting, but there's nothing grim about her expression.
<Page18>
---I wonder who is she waiting for.
She is fidgety and restless, as if she's waiting for her lover.
<Page19>
......no, hold on. Waiting?
......waiting for someone?
Obvious. That much is obvious.
I'm sure I would do the same.
In fact everyone would do the same.
If I was killed.
I don't have to think about who I want to see first.
<Page20>
---I have a bad feeling about this.
A chill runs down my spine, like a centipede crawling.
My spine feels like it's going to burst out of my mouth.
<Page21>
The girl in white looks at me.
Our gazes meet. The intentions match. Everything makes sense.
No. That's just a coincidence. It must be a coincidence.
There is no feeling. There is no connection. There is no relationship.
<Page22>
She's just a stranger who looks like her.
She must be waiting for someone else.
Otherwise, this moment is a nightmare.
Because there is no way that a dead person, a person who got dismembered like that, can be alive.
<Page23>
And yet, the living girl looks at me and smiles.
"You're finally here." she says.
She seems deeply satisfied to have found the person who killed her.
<Page24>
The girl raises her hand and smiles friendly, then stands up from the guardrail.
She ruffles her hair and comes towards me as I stand there.
<Page25>
"What the hell is------that?"
A bad dream.
The light turns red.
<Page26>
"Don't come----don't come, don't come---"
The girl doesn't seem to care and comes across the road in a straight line as cars come and go.
<Page27>
She's only three meters away.
I don't know if this is a dream or reality.
"I told you not to come here, so...!"
<Page28>
No matter how loud I shout, the reality in front of me remains the same.
So I just run away from the white girl.
<Page29>
I run.
I run as fast as I can.
Without any sense of shame or honour, I keep running as fast as I can along the asphalt road, pushing past people passing by.
<Page30>
"Hah, hah, hah, ha-----!"
My breathing is uneven and my heart is pounding.
But I still run.
My face doesn't look normal anymore.
<Page31>
My vision is distorted by tears. My throat is burning. My lungs shriveled.
The muscles in my hands are about to tear from shaking so much.
<Page32>
Both of my legs kick the ground in a futile, uncontrollable manner. Every time I take a step, I feel a numb pain in my thigh.
But that's okay. I don't care if my legs get shredded.
Because if I don't run, I'll go crazy.
<Page33>
I look behind me.
The girl in white is walking towards me.
She's definitely following me.
The girl I killed is chasing me.
That's more than enough reason for the frenzy.
<Page34>
"Hah, hah, hah------!"
I ignore my exploding heart and keep running.
I turn around and see the girl.
She's chasing me, her footsteps as light as a feather.
<Page35>
"Ha, ha, ha!" 
My chin goes up.
My arms are limp.
My legs have long since lost all feeling.
So why can't I shake off a person who's just walking around when I'm running as fast as I can?
<Page36>
"Ha, ha, ha----"
My breath hitches.
I'm not sure how many kilometers I've already ran at my top speed.
But when I look back, I still see her walking towards me.
It's a natural, strolling gait, and she never leaves me.
It's like a ghost burned into the rearview mirror.
<Page37>
".........haha, haha, haha, hahahaha"
I laugh, even though it's not funny, I still run while laughing.
<Page38>
"Haha, haha, ahahahahahaha!"
I can't stop laughing.
But I still run, and even though my body is screaming at me that I will die if I run any further, I still run.
<Page39>
The reason for running is obvious.
If she catches up to me, she'll kill me for sure.
I laugh it off, but I know better than anyone that it was just a comforting thought.
<Page40>
There is no need for any reason or rationale.
This is the natural rule, everyone knows the cause and effect.
<Page41>
If I kill her, she kills me.
Since I killed her, she has the right to kill me.
So...
It's just a fact that my life will end the moment I'm cornered.
<Page42>
"Ah..."
I fall to the ground in disarray.
It's not that my legs got tangled up, but that I couldn't move my arms and legs one more step and fell forward.
<Page43>
"...Ah, ha...!"
I crawl over to the edge of the wall and manage to reach it.
<Page44>
I put my hands on the wall and try to stand up, but it was no use.
As soon as I stand up, my knees lose strength and I fall on my butt with a thud.
As it was, my body couldn't move anymore.
<Page45>
"Ha---ha, ha---"
I look up and breathe in.
---It's painful.
I don't have enough oxygen at all.
Thanks to this, I can't think clearly.
I can't even make sense of what I'm doing.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
I don't know why, why, why the girl I killed is still alive.
<Page46>
I killed that girl.
I've completely and utterly killed her.
So how could she wait for me in front of the school and smile at me like that?
<Page47>
"......I killed you, I swear."
---Yes, I did.
I killed her.
I Killed Her.
I KILLED HER.
 why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
 why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
 why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why------?
<Page48>
"Hey, are we done playing tag?"
Step.
A dry sound echoes in the back alley.
<Page49>
She comes in with a light step, shrugs her shoulders in disappointment, and leans against the wall as if to say..
"Hello. Thank you so much for your hospitality yesterday."
She gives me a big, carefree smile.
<Page50>
".........!"
I feel like I'm going crazy.
I don't know why she's making that face.
The girl, with a smile on her face, nonchalantly and carelessly walks into this closed alleyway.
<Page51>
"And here's something you forgot.
I don't like it when people drop things that can be used as evidence."
<Page52>
A black object is tossed into the air.
It's my bag, which I haven't even realized that I had dropped until this point.
<Page53>
No, wait, what did she just say.....?
Evidence? Evidence of what exactly......?
<Page54>
"No---run, run......!"
I move my feet with that thought, but there's a concrete wall behind me, and I can't escape any further back.
<Page55>
"Hmm? I thought we were done playing tag.
Because this is a narrow alley. In addition, it's not very popular, so there's no need to worry about anyone getting in the way.
<Page56>
The girl keeps smiling, as if she was very happy.
......narrow alley? Not popular?
I look around in a panic and get disgusted by my own stupidity.
Running into a place like this is like asking for your own death.......!
<Page57>
"It's been a long time.
Eighteen hours later, I finally caught you."
With a clunk, the girl takes another step into the alleyway.
<Page58>
"You....you're----"
"What?"
"You are, definately----"
<Page59>
"Yeah. I'm the girl you killed yesterday.
I'm glad you remember me."
It was a reply I didn't want to hear, whether it was a lie or the truth.
<Page60>
"Don't be ridiculous. A person who's dead can't possibly be alive!"
"Yeah, but that's not so surprising, is it?
It's just that I was killed and then came back to life."
<Page61>
The girl replies simply and makes a clattering sound.
The distance gets shorter and shorter.
<Page62>
"......came back...to life?"
I bite down on the girl's words, stunned.
You've come back to life......?
In other words, you've recovered from near-death? So you went to a doctor and after surgery and you were revived......from that state?
<Page63>
"Don't be ridiculous!
There's no way anyone can come back to life after being dismembered like that.......!"
<Page64>
"Yes. Because I'm not human."
"-----What?"
The implications of the girl's words were, well, too simple to be interpreted differently.
<Page65>
I'm not a human being.
That's what the girl in front of me said.
<Page66>
"You're not......human.......?
"Of course not. Do you think there are people who can regenerate themselves after being torn apart limb from limb?"
"-------"
There is no way a human can do that.
If there is such a thing, it is a completely different creature that only resembles a human being.
<Page67>
Even if you kill it, it will come back.
Even if you stop it from breathing, it will come back to life.
Even if you tear it apart, it will come back to life and start moving again.
It's a thing in the shape of a person, but it can't be called a person.
<Page68>
"-------Ha..........."
That seems to be the true identity of the girl in front of me.
I try to raise my voice to laugh, but my thirsty throat is so parched that I can't even smile properly.
<Page69>
"....what in the....."
Even if it's a funny, it's not good for me.
It is too much of a coincidence to be laughed at.
<Page70>
Because, I know.
If this girl is not human, it might make sense that she is still alive even though she was killed.
<Page71>
"Ha......ha, ha......."
The core of my head calms down.
I remember the words of a certain person who saved me when I was a child.
For now, take a good look.
It's a situation that requires a lot of thinking afterwards, this.
<Page72>
"You said you aren't human.
What are you then?"
<Page73>
"Me? #I'm a vampire."
To put it simply, I'm a monster that lives off of human blood."
<Page74>
......good.
What's good about it is that the word vampire is easy to understand in its own way.
<Page75>
I know what a vampire is.
Even though it's a myth, the word "vampire" is popular and famous.
It was created by the novelist Bram Stoker. A "non-dying" monster in human form, spoken of as fiction in the Western world.
<Page76>
Secondly, and most importantly, the name alone gives you an idea of what they are.
A blood-sucking demon. Since she calls herself a demon, it's only natural that she is not human.
<Page77>
"I see, vampires.....wha---"
It was so out of blue that I almost laughed.
Even though I'm going to be killed right after this, it made me feel better.
I'm not sure why, but I feel like I don't care anymore.
<Page78>
The girl looks down at me with a satisfied look, as if she's happy to see me in such a sorry state, having thrown everything away.
<Page79>
.....but, I thought the common belief was that vampires can't walk in the sunlight.
Well, that's really a minor issue now.
<Page80>
".....so
What does a monster want from me?"
<Page81>
I get desperate and tell her off.
For some reason, the girl backs away.
It was only for a moment, and she immediately folds her hands in front of her chest and gives me a scowl.
<Page82>
"I'm surprised. Have you forgotten what you did to me yesterday?
You killed me, a complete stranger, into pieces the moment you saw me. So what do you want from me, you seem to be quite skilled at your job."
<Page83>
The girl seems to be more dismayed than angry.......
But now I feel the same way.
After all, the girl I killed with my own hands is asking me "Why did you kill me?".
<Page84>
"Hey. Are you listening, you homicidal maniac?"
"......yeah, I'm listening. I'm just trying to wrap my head around the fact that I've had some pretty bad luck.
I'm sorry, but I need you to shut up for a second."
<Page85>
Or rather, I want to hit something.
Otherwise, I might even commit suicide.
<Page86>
At this point in my life, I realize how bad my luck is.
There was a girl I suddenly felt like killing for no reason.
I let my impulses get the better of me and killed her.
<Page87>
After that, my memory was vague, and I turned my back on it, thinking it was a dream, but it turned out to be true, and in addition, the person I killed was not human.
I've always called myself defective and unfit, but compared to this situation, everything else can be called normal......
<Page88>
After that, I went through a lot of trouble and desperation.
But then, when I decided to make amends in my own way...
I found out that the person I killed wasn't even human!
<Page89>
"---------Ha, haha."
I can't help but laugh.
.....but it's not all that bad.
<Page90>
Because the person I killed has come back to life, that means I didn't kill anyone.
The act of "killing" remains, but she is alive.
I think that's something to be really happy about.
<Page91>
......yes. I can, I can do this.
Tohno Shiki can go back to his normal life as before.
<Page92>
But instead, I'm being hunted down by some monster......still that's a lot better than being a murderer.
Bad luck is bad luck, but this is just an incredibly bad luck.
If this is so ridiculous, then I'm not the only one who's crazy.
<Page93>
"......okay, I'm calm.
You have something to say, don't you? Go ahead, say what you want, whether it's a complaint or a grudge."
<Page94>
"There's a lot I want to say, but......you're a strange one. What's with the attitude in front of the vampire?"
"I'm sorry, I'm desperately trying to stay sane.......if I don't do that, I might kill myself."
<Page95>
I'm already in the mindset of "If you're going to kill me, kill me".
I've been dealing with an abnormal body for seven years.
No matter how horrible the event is, I'm prepared to accept the fact that it is true as long as it happened in front of me.
However, I never dreamed that such a case existed.
<Page96>
"Hmmm.........."
The girl stares at me.
Her gaze is sharp, but there's no hostility in it.
<Page97>
......it's strange. I'm sure it's a universal rule that if you get hit, you hit back. I'm sure this girl is itching to kill me too.......?
<Page98>
"......what are you staring at?
I know you're here to get revenge on me. Then..."
<Page99>
"Yes, it's true that if someone kills you, the rule of thumb is to kill them back.
If that's what you want, I'll do it, but for now, I think I'll pass. It doesn't balance out."
The girl looks at me straight in the face.
<Page100>
"Hey, are you sorry?"
"......what?"
<Page101>
For a moment, my eyes lit up.
The girl said something that sounded out of place.
<Page102>
"I'm asking if you're sorry for killing me, and if you are, I'll forgive you.
You don't seem like a very good liar for a human."
<Page103>
""you're sorry"......you mean me?"
"Yes. As long as you say you're sorry, that's all that matters to me."
<Page104>
---Unbelievable.
<Page105>
What's unbelievable is not that she forgave the person who killed her, but...
It's the fact that this girl's voice sounded so gentle.
<Page106>
"Ugh. I'm asking you a serious question, so you should answer properly.
Come on, answer quickly. Are you feeling sorry for what you've done or not?
If you don't make that clear, we can't move any further."
<Page107>
---Am I feeling sorry for what I did?
I don't need to be reminded of that----
<Page108>
"..................that's..."
As I was about to say the rest, something makes me pause.
I can't do that.
The moment I say it, I'll never be able to return to my former ignorance.
It's a good idea to keep your eyes peeled and pretend to be normal without noticing anything.
<Page109>
"What's that?"
-------------
<Page110>
My throat clenches.
Don't say that, I fear.
But...
<Page111>
.......but it's unavoidable.
Some things you just can't run away from.
There was someone who believed in me that way.
<Page112>
If I wish to be free,
From the sins that I've committed,
From the actions that I took,
I can't just turn my back on this.
<Page113>
"That's.......right, I regret it.
No matter what, I've killed someone."
<Page114>
I confess as I squirm.
As soon as I spill the words, there is no stopping it.
I accept that......this is it, I'm screwed.
<Page115>
Yes, I did. I killed her.
Mercilessly, for no reason at all.
I just did it for myself.
<Page116>
"......I can regret and reflect on that.
......if I can."
If I'm allowed to take such an easy way out.
"I will bow to you......as many times as you want.
......but it's meaningless.
The fact is, I killed you. So..."
<Page117>
There's no way I can be forgiven.
It's not acceptable to say "It doesn't matter because she's alive again".
I killed this girl in front of me.
It's the ultimate act of extortion.
It's a violence that can't be quantified any further.
<Page118>
"So you can have your revenge on me.
......I didn't run away because I was afraid of you. I was only running away from my own actions."
I keep my head down.
I mutter these words to myself without repenting to anyone.
<Page119>
......then, I finally wake up.
It's like I was in a dream since yesterday.
<Page120>
A dream before the end.
The escape from a reality that I kept running from for my own despicability.
And now, at last, the retribution...

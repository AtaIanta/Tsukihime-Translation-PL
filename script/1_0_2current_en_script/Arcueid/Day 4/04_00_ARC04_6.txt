<Page1>
"Yeah, it's a rather nice room.
I wouldn't mind spending an entire night in here."
<Page2>
Arcueid happily looks around the hotel room.
"――――"
I'm speechless at this turn of events.
<Page3>
"So, what do you want me to do specifically?"
"For now, let's get out of here.
My room is not suitable for protection after all... That's right, we should go to a higher place with a better view."
<Page4>
And so, here we are.
Arcueid flagged down a taxi on the main street, and we took it to the next town over.
She checked into a room at one of the most expensive hotels in the area. Not only did she rent a room...but she rented out the entire top floor. It was like she was a celebrity.
<Page5>
"Wow, it's so tall!
Human architecture really is advancing at such a rapid pace.
What do you call this kind of thing? "Wringing water from a stone"? "Rapid progress"?
Well, it doesn't really matter! Look over there, Shiki, the alleyway we were in just now has become so tiny!"
<Page6>
With the closed curtains slightly open, Arcueid is enjoying the view from the window.
I am by no means in the mood for this.
<Page7>
This place is more like a fortress built on the top floor of a hotel than a hotel room.
The curtains that block out the sunlight, the furniture that decorates the room, and the materials used for the walls and doors are several times more luxurious and sturdy than those of most hotels.
<Page8>
Since we're renting the top floor, no other guests will come to this floor. You can even see a monitor in the room that shows in detail the lobby on the first floor.
...I realize once again that the people who use these kinds of rooms are from the privileged class.
<Page9>
"Let's hide out here tonight. Oh, and don't worry about the hotel fee. #I'm rich, so I'll treat you."
<Page10>
Arcueid says this cheerfully as she moves away from the window.
She said it was a great lookout spot, but it appears she is already tired of the birds-eye view of the city.
<Page11>
"...Arcueid. What on earth are you thinking?"
I let out a heavy sigh.
<Page12>
"What do you mean, I'm thinking about a lot of things."
"No, that's not the point.
I mean sharing a room with a man―――"
<Page13>
I was about to say something, but then I stop.
All I have to do is keep an eye on this self-proclaimed vampire.
I don't have to say anything else.
<Page14>
"No, it's fine. Do what you want."
"You're weird, Shiki.
You're so unpredictable, getting angry all of a sudden and then going silent."
"What's the fun in that?" Arcueid laughs.
<Page15>
"......"
Meanwhile, I'm standing close to the door, observing the room carefully.
I'm the complete opposite of the relaxed Arcueid.
<Page16>
I'm exhausted and I want to rest, but if I sit down on the sofa now, I would sink and fall into a deep sleep.
I can't be that defenseless, no matter how desperate I am.
<Page17>
"Shiki, do you want something to drink? There seem to be a lot of drinks here!"
"........."
A carefree voice comes from the mini-bar in the room.
...The bottle in Arcueid's hand is, needless to say, some sort of alcohol.
<Page18>
"You know, I'm underage and you're offering me alco―――"
I stop myself mid-sentence.
I don't know if she's underage or not. I'm not interested and I don't feel like asking.
<Page19>
"I'll choose for myself later. More importantly―――"
No matter how tired or baffled I am, there is a question I need to ask.
<Page20>
What is this girl in front of me?
In other words, how dangerous is the situation I'm in?
I can't even sit on the couch without knowing these things to the best of my ability, even if they are outside of my common sense.
<Page21>
"...More importantly, there's something that I need to ask you.
After that, I can relax and rest."
<Page22>
"? I don't mind, but what's the matter? You're so uptight all of a sudden."
"........."
Uptight? I've never once let my guard down in front of you...but enough about that.
<Page23>
"I'm being serious here.
At the end of the day, what are you really trying to accomplish?"
<Page24>
"Me? I'm just trying to go after a vampire.
After all, I have the duty of eliminating vampires."
"Yeah, you definitely did say that earlier.
But you're a vampire too, aren't you?"
<Page25>
"What, are you saying that you still don't believe me Shiki?"
<Page26>
"Don't worry, I believe you enough.
What I'm trying to say is, why would a vampire-like yourself be going out killing other vampires? That doesn't make any sense theoretically."
"Oh, so you don't like it when members of the same group kill each other?"
<Page27>
"It's not just the same group, but outside as well.
...You know, vampires are demons that suck the blood of humans, right? Then shouldn't your target be humans and not other vampires?
What you're killing is, well―――"
If the goal is to suck blood, wouldn't it make more sense to target humans...?
<Page28>
"Bloodsucking and killing are two different things.
But still, I understand what you are saying. You're saying that we should help each other because we are the same species, right?
But vampires are like unique species that have evolved differently from each other, even though they are derived from the same greater origin.
They don't have the same sense of fellowship as humans do."
<Page29>
"...? So you're saying, the vampire that you're looking for is different from you?"
<Page30>
"Yeah, it's a different kind of vampire than me.
The vampire I'm chasing is a Dead Apostle, so it's almost exactly the same as the image you have of vampires.
They suck human blood and convert the people they kill into servants to gradually increase their power.
You remember that burning corpse from this morning, right? That's what happens to people killed by vampires. Even though they are dead as humans, they cannot die and exist as a living dead."
<Page31>
"...They're dead, but they're still alive..."
The corpse that appeared in the alleyway... According to the legend of vampires, people whose blood has been sucked become new vampires and attack people.
In this way, their numbers increase and eventually, they turn an entire village into a land of death...or so it goes.
<Page32>
"Yes. That's the kind of vampire that lurks in this town.
I'm not interested in sucking blood, and I'm not one of their kind. That's why I have no problem with killing these other vampires."
<Page33>
Arcueid says plainly.
It appears that there are many different types of vampires.
<Page34>
"...I'm a bit shaken after all this time.
So you're telling me that the reason you asked me to become your shield was so you could kill him."
<Page35>
"Yes, that was my intention at first.
I was planning to use you as a shield regardless. Even if you tried to run away, I would have tied you up with my Mystic Eyes and use you completely through fear.
But as I was talking to you, I started to change my mind."
<Page36>
...So she was planning to use force from the beginning.
Okay, I'll have to make sure to remember that.
"But why did you change your mind?"
<Page37>
"Hmm, it's because I was wrong about you.
You know, Shiki. Up until the point I restored myself after being killed by you, I thought that you were a member of the Church.
If that's the case, there was a chance that you had the location of the enemy and can be counted on as a force to be reckoned with."
<Page38>
"But in the end, you were just a completely normal person. You didn't know anything about vampires, let alone where the enemy's coffin was."
<Page39>
"...Yeah, there's no way they'd send an executor to such an atheist country like this in the first place, not to mention they wouldn't be operating alone. Their policy is to always move in master-disciple pairs after all..."
<Page40>
Arcueid mumbles to herself.
After derailing the conversation, she moves away from the pleasant atmosphere she had created.
<Page41>
"Anyway, it means that my target has returned from you to my 'original prey'.
Which is kind of a bummer, I guess."
<Page42>
She says something disturbing in a lively voice.
...Damn. She still has something against me, this woman.
Even though it's natural for her to hate me after what I did, it's not good for my heart to hear her say "I want to kill you" while smiling.
As I thought, she is going to kill me the moment I let my guard down―――
<Page43>
"Are we done with the serious stuff? Then I'm going to bed!"
"Wha?"
And then, #with a bounce in her step, #she walks over to the bed and lays down on it.
<Page44>
"I feel pretty good, so I'll sleep until the sun goes down.
Ah, Shiki, you should also get some rest while you can. Vampires can't be active during the day, so it'll be nighttime when you will have to be on full-scale watch."
<Page45>
"...You. Do you understand that you've just said something that negates your entire existence?"
"Don't worry about it.
―――Oh, I think I've reached my limit. With that, good night Shiki. Wake me up when the sun goes down, okay?"
<Page46>
"H-hey!"
"――――――"
Arcueid suddenly falls asleep like a car that got its engine turned off.
<Page47>
"―――――Seriously?"
Unbelievable. She's really asleep....
I feel like an idiot for standing so close to the door so I could escape just as I get a chance.
<Page48>
Is this really okay? I know it's not for me to say, but is that really what this girl wants?
I'm in a situation where I've been semi-forcibly brought here. At this point, I can easily escape now.
<Page49>
No, to begin with,
even though I don't have the same urges like that time,
"...I've already killed you once, you know...."
So how can she fall asleep so carelessly, this woman.
<Page50>
"........."
I stare at Arcueid's face.
Her ample breasts rise and fall, indicating that she is breathing.
The body lying on the bed does not move a muscle.
<Page51>
Sleeping like a single sheet of art.
Eyelids gently closed.
Long lashes and pretty lips that look fresh even without lipstick.
<Page52>
The mounds on her chest are well-shaped.
The line of her hips looks like a haze of hills on a horizon.
Her legs are long and slender.
Innocent yet sensual, such contradictory words come to my mind.
<Page53>
"........."
A girl like that, asleep and defenseless in such a royal hotel.
I've only known her for a short time, and yet she trusts me, the person who brutally killed her, from the bottom of her heart.
<Page54>
"What an idiot, this girl."
...Yeah, she's so stupidly honest that I get a little worried.
<Page55>
In any case, this is the turning point.
This may be the last chance I have to turn back and leave.
<Page56>
This girl told me to become her shield.
But I...
C:>...Enough with the madness. Let's run.
C:>...No more getting lost. Let's stay.

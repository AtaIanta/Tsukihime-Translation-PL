"I......."
I can't do it, or something like that is what I'll never say here.
<Page2>
I killed this person.
As a result, she is weak and in need of someone to help her.
......and I've only talked to her a little bit, but I have a feeling she's not so bad...
<Page3>
"So, what about it?
As a human, can't you help out a vampire like me?"
<Page4>
"Of course I will. You know that, don't you?"
<Page5>
"----"
Yeah, so please don't give me that look.
I feel so guilty that I can't say no.
<Page6>
"......but we're on a tight boat.
It's not a good idea to wake up and pretend that I don't know what's going on here."
......it's obvious that I'll regret it later.
But still...
<Page7>
"......above all, you're dealing with the man who is responsible for the street murders.
If so, as a resident of this city, I'd be remiss if I didn't at least help you."
<Page8>
It's better than averting my eyes from her straight gaze.
<Page9>
"That means..."
"......I don't want to be your shield, but I'll at least stand guard."
"------"
<Page10>
......this is it.
But what's with that face?
She can die and come back to life and make a tornado with the wave of her hand, but then make a face like this.
<Page11>
"Good. Now we have a deal."
The girl reaches her hand out to me.
<Page12>
"I can finally introduce myself.
I'm Arcueid.........well, it's a long name, so Arcueid is enough for now.
I'm a vampire classified as a True Ancestor, what's your name?"
<Page13>
I sigh heavily as she introduces herself, something I have never seen her do before.
......it's a sign of weakness or resignation or perhaps acceptance of this unbelievable situation.
<Page14>
"I'm Tohno Shiki. Unfortunately, I'm just a student.
......I'll tell you up front, I really am of no use to you."
<Page15>
I hold that gir---- Arcueid's hand.
She looks at me carefully, and then..
asks me to shake hands again.
<Page16>
"Nice to meet you.
For killing me, I want you to take full responsibility."
<Page17>
Arcueid smiles and holds out her left hand.
......I'm sure there are many responsibilities in the world, but I'm probably the first and last person to take responsibility for helping the person I killed.
<Page18>
"......yeah, this is insane, really."
But there's nothing else I can do at this moment.
I reluctantly hold out my left hand and shake hands with the girl in white who calls herself a vampire.

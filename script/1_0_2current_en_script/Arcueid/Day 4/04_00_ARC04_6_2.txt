"...I made a promise after all."
That's right. I've already made a promise.
Then no matter what it is, I don't think I should break it.
<Page2>
...Arcueid is asleep.
It doesn't look like it, but this girl said that she's weak.
She said she was at her limit, and I really didn't have time to think about what I was going to do after this...whether I was going to escape or stay.
<Page3>
The air has become silent.
The only two people on the floor, let alone in this room, are me and her. ...I'll put aside the question of whether it's rude to count a self-proclaimed vampire as a person.
<Page4>
"...What am I saying. She's the one that's rude here, dumbass."
I'm giving myself a hard time.
From this morning's chase to this point, my mind and body are exhausted and I don't seem to be working properly.
<Page5>
"Anyway, let's calm down first."
I move away from the door to sit down in a chair.
I sit down on a high chair in the minibar.
I take out a bottle of spring water from the refrigerator, pour it into a glass, and sip it.
<Page6>
"―――Alright."
Thanks to the cool water, my mind becomes clearer.
My mind is numb from all the unbelievable things that have happened since this morning, but I'm going to stay calm, think things over, and decide what I'm going to do...
<Page7>
"............"
"――――――――Seriously?"
This is the second time I've said that today.
The first time was directed towards Arcueid, but this time it's directed at myself.
I can't concentrate because I can hear the breathing sound of the girl sleeping next to me.
Even with my lack of principle, this is going too far. Why am I getting so excited about that girl now of all times...!
<Page8>
Let's get out of the room for now.
It's probably because I haven't gotten over my fear in the alleyway.
If I take a deep breath in the hallway, I'm sure this strange fever will cool down.
<Page9>
"...We're really renting it out..."
There are no employees on the top floor, let alone other guests.
<Page10>
Arcueid's room is a corner room at the end of the hallway.
It has a great view, but of course, it's a long way from the room to the elevator hall.
<Page11>
"...Speaking of which, the school..."
It's a little after eleven o'clock. This is definitely truancy that can't be talked out of.
<Page12>
If the school contacts my home, I'll be out of luck, but there's nothing I can do about it.
I don't care what Akiha says to me, I'm too busy to do anything about it.
<Page13>
"...It's a long shot, but I'll send a mail to Arihiko...."
<Page14>
"Feel bad today. Skipping.
Help me out if you can."
<Page15>
I'll throw out a rough explanation of the situation and a request to my close friend.
It's not something I can force him to do, but something that he can do if the timing is right.
I wish I can tell more about the situation, but...
<Page16>
"No, no. That's only for extreme emergencies."
I wouldn't be able to object if he asks me whether I have gone mad.
This much is more than enough for a guy like him.
<Page17>
"―――Now then."
I calm down after thinking back to his familiar face.
I'll resign myself and return to the room where the self-proclaimed vampire is sleeping.
<Page18>
"...Pardon the intrusion...."
I know I won't get a reply, but I can't resist saying so.
On the bed, the white girl is sleeping, looking exactly like the same as before.
There is no sense of danger. If I didn't know the situation, I would have guessed she is a princess from a foreign country.
<Page19>
I sit down on the sofa, which I avoided because I was afraid that if I sat down I would not be able to get up.
The sofa is the only place where I can see both the bed and the door at the same time.
<Page20>
As expected, the comfort of the sofa is incredible.
I feel like I'm going to melt, but I must keep watch. I've got to keep my head up and stay awake.
<Page21>
"......"
But when I look at it this way, it's still nightmarishly beautiful.
The white, smooth skin, the fingers that look like works of art alone, the soft lines of her body.
<Page22>
The overall image is flawless, and the shape of the details is unparalleled. I've never seen such a perfect form before.
No, to be more precise,
I thought I would never see something like this probably in my lifetime.
<Page23>
"......Hah."
I look up at the ceiling in contemplation.
Regardless of the fact that I killed her and she came back to life or that she is a vampire, Arcueid is a being that speaks a human language and has the form of a human being.
<Page24>
If she is too weak to wake up on her own, then the responsibility is on me.
"...You have to take responsibility for what you have done."
<Page25>
...The lessons of my childhood appear at a time like this.
I think it was Sensei that said that.
Because I have strange eyes,
they attract strange things as a result.
<Page26>
...As such, I must be prepared for anything.
For now, I have to protect her in my own way, at least for tonight, just the way I promised――――

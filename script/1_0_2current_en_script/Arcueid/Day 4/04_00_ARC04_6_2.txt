"......I promised,"
Yes. I've already made a promise.
Then no matter what it is, I don't think I should break it.
<Page2>
......Arcueid is asleep.
It doesn't look like it, but this girl said she's weak.
She said she is at her wits end, and she really didn't have time to think about what I was going to do after this......whether I was going to escape or stay.......
<Page3>
The air is still and quiet.
The only two people on the floor, let alone in this room, are me and her......I'll put aside the question of whether it's rude to count a self-proclaimed vampire as a person.
<Page4>
"......what the heck. I'm not sure what you mean by rude, dumbass."
I'm giving myself a hard time.
From this morning's chase to this point, my mind and body are exhausted and I don't seem to be working properly.
<Page5>
"Anyway, let's calm down first."
I move away from the door to sit down in a chair.
I sit down on a high chair in the minibar.
I take out a bottle of natural water from the refrigerator, pour it into a glass and sip it.
<Page6>
"---Good."
Thanks to the chilled water, my mind becomes clearer.
My mind is numb from all the unbelievable things that have happened since this morning, but I'm going to stay calm, think things over, and decide what I'm going to do...
<Page7>
"........................"
"--------Seriously?"
This is the second time I've said that today.
The previous one was directed at Arcueid, but this time it's directed at myself.
I can't concentrate because I can hear the breathing sound of the girl sleeping next to me.
I can't bee too oversensitive. I'm not sure what I'm getting excited about with that girl at this point......!
<Page8>
Let's get out of the room for now.
It's probably because I haven't gotten over my fear in the alleyway.
If I take a deep breath in the hallway, this strangeness will cool down.
<Page9>
"......we're really renting it out......."
There were no employees on the top floor, let alone other guests.
<Page10>
Arcueid's room is a corner room, at the end of the hallway.
It has a great view, but of course, it's a long way from the room to the elevator hall.
<Page11>
"......speaking of which, the school......"
It's a little after 11 am, that's an inexcusable absense.
<Page12>
If the school contacts me at home, I'll be out of luck, but there's nothing I can do about it.
I don't care what Akiha says to me, but I'm too busy to do anything about it.
<Page13>
"......it's a long shot, but I'll send an email to Arihiko......."
<Page14>
"I'm not feeling well today.
I'll see if I can catch up."
<Page15>
I'll throw out a rough explanation of the situation and a request to my terrible friend.
It's not something you can force, it's just something you can do if the timing is right.
I wish I can tell more about the situation, but...
<Page16>
"No, no, no. That's an emergency room situation."
I can't argue with someone who says "Have you finally lost your mind?".
This is just fine with him.
<Page17>
"Well..."
I think back to the familiar face and calm down.
Let's give up and return to the room where the self-proclaimed vampire is sleeping.
<Page18>
"......excuse me......."
I know I won't get a reply, but I can't resist saying so.
On the bed, the girl in white is sleeping, looking exactly like the same as before.
There is no sense of danger. If I ignore what's going on, she looks like a princess from some other country.
<Page19>
I sit down on the sofa, which I avoided because I was afraid that if I sat down I would not be able to get up.
The sofa is the only place where I can see both the bed and the door at the same time.
<Page20>
As expected, the comfort of the sofa is incredible.
I feel like I'm going to melt, but I'm the watcher. I've got to keep my head up and stay awake.
<Page21>
"............"
But when I look at it this way, it's still nightmarishly beautiful.
The white, smooth skin, the fingers that look like works of art alone, the soft lines of her body...
<Page22>
The overall image is flawless, and the shape of the details is unparalleled. I've never seen such a perfect form before.
No, that's right.
I thought I would probably never see it again.
<Page23>
"............huh."
I look up at the ceiling in contemplation.
Regardless of the fact that I killed her and she came back to life, or that she is a vampire, Arcueid is a being that speaks a human language and has the form of a human being.
<Page24>
If she is too weak to wake up on her own, and I'm responsible for it.
"......you have to take responsibility for what you have done."
<Page25>
......the lessons of my childhood show their face in these places.
I remember Sensei telling me that.
Because I have strange eyes,
They attract strange things.
<Page26>
Then be prepared for a lot of things.
For now, I have to protect her in my own way, at least for tonight, as I promised her----

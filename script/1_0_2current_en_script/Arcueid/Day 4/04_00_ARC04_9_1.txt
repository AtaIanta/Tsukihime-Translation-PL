<Page1>
"............alright."
......I take a small deep breath and shake off my doubts.
I search for something that can be used as a weapon, but there is nothing in the room that I can use.
I swallow my hesitation, take the knife from my bag, and walk to the door.......
<Page2>
"---Shiki?"
"......I'm going to check on him.
Don't leave the room until I come back."
I shake off Arcueid's gaze which is telling me she wants to say something and go out into the hallway.
<Page3>
The lights in the hallway are off, looks like there is something wrong with the electricity.
Only the elevator hall at the end of the corridor is still lit.
My throat hurts worse than when I was in my room. The air around me is rough and hot, like sandpaper.
<Page4>
The hallway is frighteningly quiet.
There is no noise.
Not a hint of human presence.
No ■■ running about,
or burning out.
It is a tense, silent space that makes you want to think that the scene you saw on the monitor was a lie.
<Page5>
"There's nothing unusual here............is there?"
I walk down the corridor.
The sweat on my forehead is falling in drops.
It's so quiet, I feel like I'm a foreign object.
A foreign body.
It is customary for vermin that disturb the atmosphere of a place to be crushed.
<Page6>
"---ugh---"
Once again, I take a deep breath to calm down.
I grab the knife again, wrapping my hand around the handle to prevent it from slipping due to sweat.
......I feel nauseous.
Something in my temples.
The nerves seem to extend from the back of my eyeballs to my brain.
<Page7>
Are my eyeballs trying to get into my brain?
Or is my brain trying to swallow the eyeballs?
Biting down on the dull pain, I walk down the road in the intense heat.
<Page8>
"------"
It hurts.
My eyes hurt.
My head feels heavy, and I feel like I'm going to collapse.
Yeah, I know this feeling.
That's the feeling I get right before I collapse from anemia.
<Page9>
"Haa-----ah"
I want to live.
I can't take it anymore, so I take off my glasses.
<Page10>
The elevator comes into view.
It's a long hallway.
It's more than 20 meters from here to the elevator hall.
That's a long way, I thought.
Go back, I thought.
---Something.
A few more steps, and it'll be too late.
<Page11>
I hear a sound.
Disturbing the harmony of this clean, lifeless space.
The chime of an elevator bell.
<Page12>
It's so ominous that I stop in my tracks.
My eyes stare at the uninvited object.
<Page13>
The lamp stops.
The box arrives.
I see a line on the elevator door far ahead.
No, that's...
It's so dense that it looks like a wall of speckles.
<Page14>
The door opens.
A narrow, iron box opens.
<Page15>
Inside the box,
It's overflowing 
The flesh of everyone who used to be alive.
<Page16>
"------"
I stop breathing.
Just as my brain refuses to think, my lungs have given up their activity.
<Page17>
Inside the iron box called an elevator.
Red flesh tightly squeeze together.
Two dogs gobbling up the meat.
<Page18>
My vision turns bright red.
Red jelly begins to flow out of the elevator with a gurgling sound.
In a sea of blood, people, bones, brains, fingers, and organs.
The two black dogs were the only living life.
<Page19>
"Ah...I..."
My reason refuses to accept this scene.
At the end of the corridor, inside the elevator, dogs are rummaging through people's bodies.
Through a gap in the elevator, a vent leading to the floor below.
A lot of screams that weren't there before are leaking out.
<Page20>
That is... if you listen carefully.
The sound of meat being chewed,
screams for help, and the screams of people who are no longer even speaking humanly.
<Page21>
My brain is directly connected to my hearing.
I can't see it, but it's visible in my head.
People being burned alive,
I see people being burned alive and eaten alive. 
<Page22>
A man notices the unusual temperature. The moment he opens the door to go outside, he was enveloped by the eternal fire that had filled the room and died.
There is a girl who was locked in her room crying. The flames that come up from the lobby fill the floor, and the girl turns to ashes in the bathtub like a burnt fish.
The adults rush to the elevator as fast as they can. There are dozens of people in the elevator. The guests, who are no longer human beings, eat the people to their heart's content.
<Page23>
The screams are divided between fear of being eaten and despair of burning up.
No one was an exception.
Beneath my feet, in this huge box called a hotel.
There is a hellscape so close to me that I can feel it firsthand.
<Page24>
"------"
I feel nauseous.
But I can't throw up.
I know that if I do that I will become part of that red sea.
<Page25>
"Ha---a. Ha... Ha. Ha."
I Resume breathing.
Biting down hard on my teeth to regain control.
<Page26>
The dogs in the elevator notice me.
I notice that the noise from downstairs have stopped.
<Page27>
"............ha"
In other words.
That means there is no one left alive.
<Page28>
The two black dogs begin to run.
In this hunting ground, I am their last prey.
<Page29>
A black dog is coming towards me.
I can see countless lines on its body.
<Page30>
---And yet...
My paralyzed brain doesn't send me any instructions to fight or run.
<Page31>
The first black dog leaps.
Its speed is beyond that of a human.
The 20-meter corridor took no more than two seconds.
<Page32>
The black dog's mouth opens.
Its fangs, which were aligned like saws, comes towards my throat.
<Page33>
Swift and precise.
The moment I realize it's coming.
The black dog's fangs makes a gargling sound and bites into my throat.
Tohno Shiki died.
<Page34>
No...that's wrong.
This won't kill you and you won't die.
I don't hesitate when people are dying.
----A hot summer day.
A long time ago, or maybe seven years.
I'm sure I've seen much more devastation than this----
<Page35>
Ah.
I plunge my knife into the head of the black dog that have bitten me on the neck.
The moment the fangs touched the skin, just before they bit into the carotid artery, my arm automatically moved.
<Page36>
I'm amazed at myself.
I wasted no time running the knife through the dog's eyebrows as if it were a machine that can only cut things.
Because that was the first dog's 'line'.
<Page37>
Normally, when an animal's brain is damaged, its movement does not immediately stop.
Muscles that have already received signals from the brain will execute the last possible command.
<Page38>
So if I tear the head open a little here, the black dog's fangs will bite my neck off.
Yeah, well... you know, normally.
<Page39>
But the black dog is dead.
Death is a stop. This thing lost all its power when I killed it.
<Page40>
The first dog falls to the ground.
The second dog replaces it and leaps at my face.
<Page41>
"------"
I plunge the knife into its open mouth.
The blade burrows into its flesh. The dog's outer skin is hard, but its insides are soft. Its bones and flesh are rotten.
<Page42>
But this was a mistake.
This thing's "line" is not on its face but on its chest.
If you stab him in the mouth, it's just a laceration.
<Page43>
The knife reaches the back of the head from inside the black dog's mouth.
Naturally, the hand that holds the knife ends up inside the black dog's mouth.
<Page44>
"------Ah"
The black dog is still alive.
Its jaws are closed.
The cartilage, the soft joint between the hand holding the knife and the arm, is about to be bitten off.
The pain finally brings me back to my senses.
<Page45>
"Ah---!"
You've got to be kidding me. ......!
What the hell am I doing sticking a knife in a dog's mouth and letting it bite off my arm?
<Page46>
"This----.........!"
I struggle to pull my arm out.
The pain that grinds my arm sparks in my vision.
<Page47>
The dog's fangs have dug into my arm and I can't seem to get them out.
No, that's not the point----the black dog is full of energy even though its head is pierced.
<Page48>
The black dog shakes his body and forcefully places himself on top of me.
<Page49>
"......!"
I fall to the floor with a thud.
But I still can't get my arm out.
The black dog is still pierced by the knife, and yet he still puts pressure on his chin.
<Page50>
"Ah......!"
My arms are being ripped off...!
I can't believe it, no creature can bite something in this condition, a dog is......!
<Page51>
"This...Ah ......!"
A wet and slimy feeling.
If I look at it, blood is spilling out of the black dog's mouth.
<Page52>
Is it the black dog's head that was pierced by the knife?
Or is it the blood from my arm that's about to be eaten?
To be honest, it doesn't matter to my confused head.
<Page53>
"Let go!"
Even if I try to escape, the black dog is biting my arm.
I can't escape.
I can't escape in the first place.
I don't have a choice. #I just want to stay alive. There's only one thing to do if you want to stay alive.
That is. Just kill it.
<Page54>
"------"
So what do I do?
One of my arms will be torn off in a few seconds.
That's the arm holding the knife.
I'm being pushed down.
Even if I can pull my arm out, the next instant the freed black dog will bite my neck.
<Page55>
"---ha"
In that desperate situation, a Humorous smile comes to my face.
It's okay. Look carefully first, then think carefully.
That's the lesson you've been following all this time, right?
<Page56>
You see. For example, you can see more than enough lines behind the dog's head.
This way, the way to survive is always simple.
<Page57>
"Gosh----!"
So why do I Hesitate?
This is a violent animal. A man-eating beast.
But it's alive and so close, so suffocating, so beating.
<Page58>
"Ha, g---!"
The force of the bite on my arm grows even stronger.
Stupid. Too stupid. It's so inconsistent it makes me want to kill it.
In a providence where if you don't kill, you will be killed.
Why me?
Why do we humans hesitate thinking that it is a cruel act...?
<Page59>
A drop of red blood falls on my face.
The red blood drips down my forehead and drips into my eyes.
Vermilion seeps into the back of my eyeballs.
<Page60>
"Ah ----"
A vermilion color that scorches my vision.
Hot mucus that I've missed for some time.
My consciousness goes into a daze.
<Page61>
"......still, I..,
I can't kill something that's alive."
---What hypocrisy.
That's me.
<Page62>
......oh, yes, I did.
But not that time.
Tohno Shiki wasn't in his right mind when he killed Arcueid.
Even when he killed the first black dog, it had nothing to do with his own will.
<Page63>
But now it's my own choice.
......you said it yourself, Shiki.
Use this power with your own will.
<Page64>
That's why.
As long as I am who I am, as long as I'm a decent human being, I should never take life for granted.
<Page65>
---That's hypocrisy too.
Because I did it a long time ago.
<Page66>
"A--------"
......a bad dream from your childhood.
<Page67>
---Look, what are you waiting for?
<Page68>
......it was a hot summer day.
<Page69>
---If you don't kill him, he'll kill you.
<Page70>
......in front of me, the shadow of a boy covered in blood.
<Page71>
---You are already...
<Page72>
......I have hot, hot, red blood on my hands.
<Page73>
I've already killed a man once.
<Page74>
"Aaahhhh!"
I stab it.
Instead of pulling out my arm, I bury it further into the black dog's head.
<Page75>
A cry of pain echoes in my eardrums.
The black dog's fainting resembles a high-pitched woman's scream. He's crying even though he can't wail properly with my arm stuck in his mouth.
<Page76>
I bet it hurts that much.
I don't care.
I plunge the knife deeper with the bitten arm.
<Page77>
The knife emerges from the back of the black dog's head.
It splits the skull and cuts the skin easily,
Blood and brains are scattered everywhere.
Incidentally, my arm holding the knife also completely penetrates the head.
<Page78>
But the black dog is still alive.
There's only one thing to do.
I reach out my other arm. I rip the knife from my bloody fingers and hold it with my left hand.
The dog's whole body rasps out a plea.
Its fangs relaxes as if in apology.
I don't care. #I simply dismantle the black dog along the line.

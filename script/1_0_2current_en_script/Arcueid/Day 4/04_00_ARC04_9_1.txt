<Page1>
"......Alright."
...I take a small, deep breath and shake off my doubts.
I search for something that could be used as a weapon, but there was nothing in the room that I can use.
...I swallow my hesitation, take the knife out of my bag and walk to the door.
<Page2>
"―――Shiki?"
"...I'm going to find out what's happening.
Don't leave the room until I come back."
I shake off the gaze of Arcueid who seemingly wanted to say something and go out into the hallway.
<Page3>
The lights in the hallway are off, which seems to be due to a problem with the electrical system.
The only thing that is lit is the elevator hall at the end of the corridor.
My throat hurts more than when I was in my room. The air surrounding me is hot and rough like sandpaper.
<Page4>
The hallway is frighteningly quiet.
There isn't even a single noise.
Not even a single sign of life.
No ■■ running about,
and no ■■ burning away.
It is an all-enveloping space of complete silence that made me want to believe that the scene I saw on the monitor was a lie.
<Page5>
"......There's nothing unusual, is there?"
I walk down the corridor.
The sweat on my forehead turns into droplets and falls.
It is so overly quiet that I fall under the illusion of me being the foreign object.
...A foreign object.
It is customary for vermin that disturb the atmosphere of a place to be crushed.
<Page6>
"―――, Hah―――"
Once again, I take a deep breath to calm down.
I grab the knife again, wrapping my hand around the handle to prevent it from slipping from the sweat.
...I feel nauseous.
There's something around the temple of my forehead.
The nerves seem to extend from the back of my eyeballs to my brain.
<Page7>
Are my eyeballs trying to sink into my brain?
Or is my brain trying to swallow my eyeballs?
Biting down on the dull pain, I continue walking down the fiery path.
<Page8>
"――――――"
It hurts.
My eyes hurt.
My head feels heavy, and I feel like I'm going to collapse.
Yeah, I know this feeling.
This is the feeling I get right before I collapse from anemia.
<Page9>
"Haa―――――ah"
It hurts.
With the pain becoming worse and unbearable, I take off my glasses.
<Page10>
The elevator comes into view.
It's a long hallway.
There are more than 20 meters between here and the elevator hall.
That's a long way, I thought.
Go back, I thought.
―――For some reason.
I thought that if I take a few more steps, then there would be no turning back.
<Page11>
I hear a sound.
As if to disturb the harmony of this pure, clean space devoid of life,
the chime of an elevator bell rings.
<Page12>
The overwhelming ominous feeling makes my legs freeze on the spot.
I can do nothing but stare at the uninvited guest.
<Page13>
The lamp stops.
The box arrives.
I can see the lines of the elevator door in the distance.
No, it's more like,
the lines are so crowded that it looks like a wall of speckles.
<Page14>
The door opens.
The small, iron box opens its doors.
<Page15>
Inside the box,
the flesh of the ones that used to be alive,
flow across the floor like a puddle.
<Page16>
"――――――"
My breathing stops.
My lungs also abandon all functions as if my brain is refusing my right to think.
<Page17>
Inside the iron box known as an elevator.
Red flesh tightly crammed together.
In the midst of it, all are two dogs gobbling up the meat.
<Page18>
My vision turns bright red.
Red <mucus|jelly> begins to flow out of the elevator with a gurgling sound.
Within the sea of blood, bodies, bones, brains, fingers, and organs,
were the two black dogs. The only living lifeforms.
<Page19>
"Ah―――, eh―――"
My mind refuses to accept this scene as reality.
Inside the elevator at the end of the corridor, the dogs are rummaging through people's bodies.
Through a gap in the elevator, from a vent leading to the floor below.
Numerous screams can be heard leaking out that weren't there before.
<Page20>
I can hear it if I listen carefully.
Whether it's the sound of meat being chewed on,
the screams calling for help, or the sounds of death and agony that barely resemble that of human language.
<Page21>
My brain that is directly connected to my hearing can imagine it.
Although I can't see it, it is visible in my head.
The sight of people being burned alive,
the sight of people being eaten alive, and their forms being disfigured.
<Page22>
There was a man that had noticed the unusual temperature. The moment he opened the door to go outside, he was enveloped by the world-ending conflagration that had filled the room and died.
There was a girl who was locked in her room crying. The flames that came up from the lobby filled the floor, turning the girl in the bathtub into ashes like a burnt fish.
There were adults who rushed to the elevator as fast as they could. The elevator was full of dozens of <p|・><r|・><e|・><v|・><i|・><o|・><u|・><s|・> <g|・><u|・><e|・><s|・><t|・><s|・>. The guests, who were no longer human beings, ate the adults that had arrived to their heart's content.
<Page23>
The screams were divided between the fear of being eaten and the despair of burning up.
No one was an exception.
Beneath my feet, inside this large box called a hotel.
There is a hellscape so close to me that it makes my skin crawl.
<Page24>
"――――――"
I feel nauseous.
But there's no way I can throw up.
Because if I did that―――I would also become one with that sea of red.
<Page25>
"Ha―――a. Ha. Ah. Ha, "
I resume my breathing that had stopped.
Biting down hard on my teeth, I take back control of myself.
<Page26>
The dogs in the elevator notice my presence.
After coming back to my senses, I realize that the noise from downstairs has ceased.
<Page27>
"......Ha"
In other words.
That means that there is no one left alive anymore.
<Page28>
The two black dogs begin to run.
In this hunting ground, I am their final prey.
<Page29>
The black dog heads towards me.
I can see countless lines on its body.
<Page30>
―――But despite this,
my paralyzed mind doesn't send me any instructions to fight or run.
<Page31>
The first of the two black dogs leaps.
Its speed is beyond that of a human.
The length of the 20-meter corridor was traversed in no more than two seconds.
<Page32>
The black dog opens its mouth.
Its fangs, which were aligned like saws, come towards my throat.
<Page33>
Swift and precise.
The moment I realize it's coming.
The black dog's fangs make a gargling sound and bite into my throat.
I, Tohno Shiki, have died.
<Page34>
No. That can't be right.
There's no way I would be killed from this, let alone die.
I don't hesitate when there are people dying.
――――A hot summer day.
A long time ago, or maybe it was seven years ago.
At that time, I'm sure I had seen a much more vividly gruesome scene than this――――
<Page35>
Stab.
I plunge my knife into the head of the black dog that had bitten me on my neck.
The moment its fangs touched my skin, just before it bit into the carotid artery, my arm moved itself automatically.
<Page36>
I'm amazed even at myself.
I wasted no time running the knife through the dog's forehead as if I was a machine whose only function was to cut things.
Because that was where the first dog's 'line' was.
<Page37>
Under normal circumstances, an animal's movement will not immediately stop even at the time its brain becomes damaged.
Muscles that have already received signals from the brain will execute the last possible command.
<Page38>
So even if I more or less tear its head apart, the black dog's fangs will still bite my neck off.
Yeah, well―――under normal circumstances, that is.
<Page39>
However, the black dog is 'dead'.
To die is to be stopped. The dog lost all of its effects the moment it was about to kill me.
<Page40>
The first dog falls to the ground.
The second dog replaces it and leaps at my face.
<Page41>
"――――――"
I thrust the knife into its open mouth.
With a stab, the blade burrows itself into its flesh. The dog's outer skin is hard, but its insides are soft. Its bones and flesh are both literally rotten.
<Page42>
But that was a mistake.
This thing's 'line' is not on its face but on its chest.
If I stab it in the mouth, it just becomes a mere tear in its flesh.
<Page43>
The knife reaches the back of the head from inside the black dog's mouth.
Naturally, the hand that holds the knife ends up inside the black dog's mouth.
<Page44>
"――――――Ah"
The black dog is still alive.
Its jaws are being closed.
The cartilage, the soft joint between the hand holding the knife and the arm, is about to be bitten off.
The pain finally brings me back to my senses.
<Page45>
"Ah, ah―――!"
You've got to be kidding me...!
What the hell am I doing sticking a knife in a dog's mouth and letting it bite off my arm?
<Page46>
"You――――little.....!"
I struggle to pull my arm out.
The intense pain of my arm being pulverized creates a spark in my vision.
<Page47>
It doesn't seem like the dog's fangs biting into my arms will let go.
No, besides that――――The black dog is full to the brim with energy even though its head is pierced.
<Page48>
The black dog shakes his body and forcefully positions itself on top of me.
<Page49>
"...!"
I fall to the floor with a thud.
But I still can't get my arm out.
The black dog is pierced by the knife, and yet it still applies force to its jaw.
<Page50>
"Hee, gh...!"
My arm is being ripped off―――!
I can't believe it. No creature can bite something in this condition, even for a dog...!
<Page51>
"Y-You, little......!"
A wet and slimy feeling.
When I look at it, blood is spilling out of the black dog's mouth.
<Page52>
Is it coming from the black dog's head that was pierced by the knife?
Or is the blood coming from my arm that's getting bitten off?
To be honest, it doesn't matter which it is to my disordered mind.
<Page53>
"Let―――go!"
Even if I try to escape, the black dog will still bite my arm.
There's no way I can escape.
There was no way for me to escape in the first place.
I don't have a choice.# I just want to survive. There's only one thing I can do if I want to stay alive.
In other words, all I have to do is kill this thing.
<Page54>
"――――――"
So what do I do?
One of my arms will be torn off in a few seconds.
That's the arm holding the knife.
I'm being pushed down.
Even if I can pull my arm out, the black dog will bite at my neck the very next instant it becomes free.
<Page55>
"―――, Heh."
In the midst of this hopeless situation, I let out a humorous laugh.
It's okay. First, I need to look at this situation and then carefully think about what to do next.
That's the lesson you've been following all this time, right?
<Page56>
Come on. For example, you can see more than enough 'lines' behind the dog's head.
In this way, the method for surviving has always been simple.
<Page57>
"Ghh――――!"
And yet, why do I hesitate?
This is a violent animal. A beast that eats away the lives of humans.
But even so, right next to you is a single lifeform whose pulse is burning to the point of suffocation.
<Page58>
"Ha, gh―――!"
The force of the bite on my arm grows even stronger.
Stupid. I'm so stupid. It's so contradictory that I want to kill myself.
In a world that is kill or be killed,
why do I...
Why do we humans hesitate like it's some sort of cruel act―――
<Page59>
A drop of red blood falls on my face.
The red blood drips down my forehead and enters my eyes.
Dark vermilion seeps into the back of my eyeballs.
<Page60>
"Ah――――"
A vermilion color that scorches my vision.
Hot mucus that seems nostalgic somehow.
My consciousness goes into a daze.
<Page61>
"...But still, I...
I can't kill something that's alive."
―――How hypocritical.
A person like you has already killed a much greater animal than that lowly beast.
<Page62>
...Ah, you're right.
But that time was different.
I wasn't in my right mind back when I killed Arcueid.
Even when I took down the first black dog, it had nothing to do with my own will.
<Page63>
But now it is definitely a choice that only I can make.
...Isn't that what Sensei said, Shiki?
That this power can only be used through your own will and no one else.
<Page64>
That's why.
As long as I am who I am, as long as I continue to be a decent human being, that I should respect life and never treat it so lightly.
<Page65>
―――But that's also hypocrisy.
Because that already happened a long time ago.
<Page66>
"Ah――――――――"
...A bad dream from my childhood.
<Page67>
―――Come on, what are you waiting for?
<Page68>
...That was a hot summer day.
<Page69>
―――If you didn't kill him, he would have killed you instead.
<Page70>
...In front of me was the figure of a boy covered in blood.
<Page71>
―――You already
<Page72>
...The red, hot blood on my hands.
<Page73>
I already killed a person once, didn't I?
<Page74>
"AAAAAAAAAAHH!"
I stab it.
Instead of pulling out my arm, I bury it further into the black dog's head.
<Page75>
A cry of pain echoes in my eardrums.
The black dog's fainting resembles a high-pitched woman's scream. It's crying even though it can't wail properly with my arm stuck in his mouth.
<Page76>
I bet it must hurt a lot.
But it doesn't matter.
I thrust the knife deeper with the bitten arm.
<Page77>
The knife emerges from the back of the black dog's head.
It splits the skull and cuts the skin easily,
causing the blood and brain tissue to be scattered everywhere.
Incidentally, my arm holding the knife also completely penetrates the head.
<Page78>
But even with that, the black dog is still alive.
There's only one thing to do.
I reach out my other arm. I rip the knife from my bloody fingers and hold it with my left hand.
The dog's whole body rasps out a plea.
The dog loosens its fangs as if to show its apology.
Like I care.# I simply dismantle the black dog along the line.

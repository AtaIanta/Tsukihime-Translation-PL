――――My life has been unfortunate.
I remember the scene from yesterday when I killed Arcueid.
<Page2>
A time filled with the stench of blood and death.
I don't want to go through something like that ever again.
If I stay with Arcueid, the same thing will definitely happen again. If I don't want that, I have no choice but to go back to the mansion.
<Page3>
"――――――"
...There's a big flaw in my choice.
Knowing what it was and what I did wrong as a person, I keep a lid on my thoughts.
I am not running away.
I tell myself that I'm just returning back to normal.
<Page4>
"...I'll go back to the mansion. If I do that, then surely..."
By the time dawn breaks, at a completely unrelated time, I will surely reach some sort of conclusion.
<Page5>
"Hey there. Can I have a word with you?"
"Eh?"
Just as I was about to get up from the bench, a voice called out to me from behind.
<Page6>
"Normally I'd leave you alone, but you have such a pathetic look on your face."
<Page7>
There is a girl standing there. I don't think I've ever seen her before, but she seems familiar.
She seems to be a middle school student, but she is not wearing a uniform. I wonder if she is skipping school like I am.
<Page8>
"....What exactly is pathetic?"
"Your face. It has the same color as clay. That's the kind of face people have when they die, right?"
<Page9>
"――――――"
That was very awkward, even for a joke.
I couldn't laugh and respond to what she just said.
The girl is staring at me, not seeming to care that I have taken it so seriously.
<Page10>
"I'm not joking, I'm talking based on experience. A grandpa of someone I knew stopped breathing after three hours from looking like that. If I had called an ambulance, I might have been able to save him."
<Page11>
The girl doesn't come close to me.
She keeps her distance of about a meter,
<Page12>
"Do you want me to call an ambulance?
In that case, lend me your phone. I don't want to use mine for this."
<Page13>
"―――,# Ha."
A breath of relief escaped my lips at the unexpected offer.
As the girl had said, I had been experiencing a malfunction that I just hadn't noticed.
<Page14>
With a sudden return to normal life, I start to breathe properly again.
<Page15>
"No, I'm fine. It's just some mild anemia, it'll be over soon.
―――But even so, thanks for calling out to me. That was a real help."
<Page16>
"I see. I'll leave you to it then.
...Your health, has it always been this bad?"
"?"
Just as she says her farewells, the girl asks me a strange question.
<Page17>
"...Well, I was born with it, I guess.
Ever since I was a kid, I get dizzy whenever I exercise a little."
"Hmm. I guess dogs are out of the question then. You can't play with them after all."
"No, I don't have a problem going for a walk."
I don't have any desire to get a dog, but it's kind of sad to completely deny it.
<Page18>
"A walk....
Your face is still pale. I suggest that you go home quickly and get some rest."
<Page19>
The girl walks away.
"Huh...?"
The moment she left, for some reason, it felt like her condition was many times more worse than mine.
<Page20>
In the end, I rest at the park and then head home.
The sun is setting and it is getting completely dark.
<Page21>
It is past seven in the evening.
The curfew of the mansion is eight o'clock, so if I don't hurry home, Akiha will give me a hard time again.
<Page22>
The streets around the mansion are as empty as ever.
Even though the sun has just set, it is as quiet as if it were midnight.
<Page23>
"Speaking of which, this place is..."
This is the place where I came to check on the noisy dog the night I came back to the mansion.
<Page24>
"?"
Just now, there was something in front of me, a black <thing|lump of meat>.
<Page25>
"――――――"
My consciousness froze.
Why are those here, I wonder.
It's obvious, or so I've come to realize.
<Page26>
It wasn't just Arcueid who was spotted in the alleyway.
The person that was with Arcueid would also become a target for capture.
Didn't I block my thoughts so that I wouldn't be aware of that fact?
<Page27>
As if to make up for the delay, I take out my knife.
At the edge of the street... I step back, keeping my eyes on the corpses that emerged from the thicket.
At that moment,
<Page28>
――――That's strange.
Suddenly, the whole area turns into a bright red.
<Page29>
I hear a rumbling sound.
It's coming from somewhere very close.
My whole body is convulsing in extreme pain like a spring.
I'm thrashing around again and again.
My consciousness, my body, my vision, the world,
are all spinning like an emergency light.
<Page30>
Rumble. Rumble. Rumble.
The sound.
It seems to be coming from my body.
<Page31>
"■■■■■―――!"
I fall to the asphalt.
I can't move my arms or legs. There's nothing left to move.
Only pain is running through my eyes.
<Page32>
"―――A lack of warmth.
You are not even a dog that is able to protect your master."
<Page33>
I hear a hoarse voice.
The sound of grease exploding on the asphalt.
I didn't realize until the very end that this was the remains of the filth that had poured out of me.

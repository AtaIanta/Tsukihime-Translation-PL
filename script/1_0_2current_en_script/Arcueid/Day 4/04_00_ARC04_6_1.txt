---- I'm afraid for my life.
It reminds me of the scene yesterday when I killed Arcueid.
<Page2>
A time filled with the stench of blood and death.
I don't want to go through that again.
If I stay with Arcueid, the same thing will definitely happen again. If I don't want that, I'll have to go back to the mansion.
<Page3>
"------"
...... There's a big flaw in my choice.
Knowing what it was and what was wrong with me as a person, I kept a lid on my thoughts.
This is not running away.
I'm just trying to return to normal, I tell myself.
<Page4>
"Let's go back to the mansion....... Then, I will be sure.
By the end of the night, there will be something settled that I don't even know about.
<Page5>
"Hey there. Can I have a word with you?"
"What?"
Just as I was about to get up from the bench, a voice called out to me from behind.
<Page6>
"I'd leave you alone, but you look so pathetic.
<Page7>
There was a girl standing there, I don't think i've ever seen her before, but she seems familiar.
She seemed to be a junior high school student, but she was not wearing a uniform. I wonder if she was bunking school like me.
<Page8>
"...... What's pathetic?"
"Your face. It's coloured like clay. That's what people look like when they die, right?"
<Page9>
"------"
That was a bad pause for a joke.
I couldn't just laugh and say, "Really?"
The girl was staring at me, not seeming to care that I had taken it so seriously.
<Page10>
"I'm not joking, I'm talking about my experience. The person I knew stopped breathing after three hours from looking like that. If I had called an ambulance, he might have survived."
<Page11>
The girl didn't come close to me.
She kept her distance of about a metre,
<Page12>
"Do you want me to call an ambulance?
Then lend me your phone. I don't want to use mine."
<Page13>
"---,#Ha."
A breath of relief escaped my lips at the unexpected offer.
As the girl had said, I had been experiencing a malfunction that I just hadn't noticed.
<Page14>
With the sudden return of daily life, breathing resumed correctly.
<Page15>
"No, I'm fine. It's just a little anemia, it'll pass soon.
---But thank you for calling out to me."
<Page16>
"I see. I'll leave you to it.
...... Are you feeling sick all the time?"
"?"
I said, "Well then," and the girl asked me a strange question.
<Page17>
"...... Well, I was born with it, I guess.
Ever since I was a kid, I get dizzy when I exercise a little."
"Hmm. No dogs, then. You can' t play with them.
"No, I don't have a problem walking a dog."
I don't have any desire to get a dog, but it's kind of sad to completely deny it.
<Page18>
"A walk....
You're still pale. I suggest you go home and get some rest."
<Page19>
The girl walked away.
"Hey, ......?"
As she left, I somehow felt that she was in much worse shape than I was.
<Page20>
In the end, I went to the park to rest up and then headed home.
The sun was setting and it was getting dark.
<Page21>
It was past seven in the evening.
The curfew of the house is 8:00, so if I don't hurry home, Akiha will give me a hard time again.
<Page22>
The streets around the house are as empty as ever.
Even though the sun has just set, it is as quiet as if it were midnight.
<Page23>
"Speaking of which, this place is......."
This is the place where I came to check on the noisy wild dogs on the night I came back to the mansion.
<Page24>
"?"
Now, there's something in front of me, a black <thing|lump of meat>.
<Page25>
"------"
My consciousness froze.
Why here, I wonder.
Of course, I understand.
<Page26>
It wasn't just Arcueid who was spotted in the alleyway.
Whoever she was with will also be captured.
Didn't I cover my thoughts so that I wouldn't be aware of that fact?
<Page27>
As if to make up for the delay, I take out my knife.
At the end of the road...... I stepped back, keeping my eyes on the Dead man who appeared from the thicket.
At that moment,
<Page28>
---- strange.
Suddenly, the whole area turns red.
<Page29>
I hear a rumbling sound.
It's coming from somewhere very close.
My whole body is bouncing like a spring in extreme pain.
I'm bouncing again and again.
My consciousness, my body, my vision, the world,
Are spinning like an emergency light.
<Page30>
Gurgling. Bang, bang. Rumbling.
The sound.
The sound seems to be coming from My body.
<Page31>
"■■■■■---!"
I fall to the asphalt.
I can't move my arms or legs. There's nothing left to move.
Only pain is running through my eyes.
<Page32>
"--It's not even warm enough.
You were not even a dog that could protect your master."
<Page33>
I heard a hoarse voice.
The sound of grease exploding on the asphalt.
I didn't realize until the very end that this was the end result of the filth that had been poured out of me.

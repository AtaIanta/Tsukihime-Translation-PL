"First, let's divide them into different types.
There are two main types of vampires."
<Page2>
"Those that were vampires before and those that became vampires after.
The former are called the True Ancestors, and the latter are called the Dead Apostles."
<Page3>
"You call them vampires, but they're the Dead Apostles.
The story of the hierarchy is also about the ecology of the Dead Apostles. They suck human blood, make servants of them, are weak in the sun, and are defeated before the baptismal ritual.
Our enemies are also vampires, identified as the Dead Apostles."
<Page4>
Before you know it, it's gone from "my enemy" to "our enemy". I'd like to point this out, but it's not a mistake at this point, so I'll let it pass.
<Page5>
"......hmm. You said the Dead Apostles weren't vampires from the beginning, what does that mean?"
<Page6>
"The Dead Apostles are humans, animals, and other "Non-Vampires".
Some are immortalized by Magic, while others have their blood sucked and become servants.
In either case, the result is the same.
Those who become vampires gain an imperfect but immortal body and are removed from the human category.
<Page7>
"............"
There are two types of vampires: the True Ancestors, who were vampires from the beginning, 
and Dead Apostles, who were humans and became vampires.
......but.
I think there is a discrepancy or a structural contradiction in this story.
<Page8>
"Hey Shiki. How much do you know about the characteristics of vampires?"
<Page9>
"I only know the basics.
The common image of vampires is that they suck the blood of virgins, glare at them, bind them, turn themselves into mist, or turn themselves into wolves......."
<Page10>
"Yes, I think you're almost right.
The reason why they suck the blood of virgins is because the blood, which has not been exchanged with other humans yet, is suitable for replenishing their genes. It's more nutritious than regular blood, that's the difference."
<Page11>
"Dead Apostles--those who are acquired vampires--are imperfectly immortal. It is true that they are immortal and have transformed into a life form with dynamic cells that are difficult to kill.
But it's like a fire that burns and must be constantly replenished with energy or it will go out."
<Page12>
"Any living thing needs to be nourished in order to function, right? It's the same. The only thing is that vampires don't have a lifespan as long as they continue to take in their diet."
<Page13>
"Vampires who have 'become' vampires, like the Dead Apostles, suck blood because they need it to survive.
They were originally human, so it's impossible for them to have an immortal body."
<Page14>
"The longer they live, the more power they gain, the less the genes that make up their bodies can withstand the growth of atoms. If they don't continue to increase their strength, they will collapse, but if they increase their strength too much, they will not be able to maintain their own shape."
<Page15>
"So what do they do to make up for it?
It's easy. Simply take in the normal ones from elsewhere, not the abnormal ones like they have, and supplement the ones that are disappearing."
<Page16>
"The same way that humans prefer organic compounds in their diet.
Vampires gather their normal genetic information and caloric value from blood. The soul's calorific value, if you will."
<Page17>
"In other words, they fix their own bodies by sucking human blood and taking in their genetic information.
For the Dead Apostles, bloodsucking is not only a way to feed and pool their power, but it is also an essential part of their existence."
<Page18>
"............"
It's complicated. And it's long.
I'm not even sure I'm following her, but Arcueid keeps on talking.
<Page19>
"The next one is......the one that puts you in a bind just by staring at you.
This is a kind of "Mystic Eyes".
The eyeball is a useful and powerful Magic Circuit, so there are many vampires that have the Mystic Eyes.
<Page20>
"Directional magic release function" I guess that's easier to understand. #I think it's called the......beam from the eyes. Something like that."
<Page21>
"Wait, there's a beam?"
I can't help but lean forward at the appearance of such a ridiculous word.
<Page22>
"Huh? I mean...yeah, but no....not really.
I don't think there are any vampires that do that kind of thing. It's just an image. I'm talking about an impression."
I see. That's both good and disappointing.
<Page23>
"But, what's a Mystic Eye?"
"It's a special kind of eye that uses Magic Circuits to release single-action magic.......it's kind of like a skill."
<Page24>
"You know, we have sword fighting, right? It's the same.
There are various types, but it's a technique that can be used by any Dead Apostle. However, even if you've trained yourself, the power depends on the individual differences and talents of the practitioner."
<Page25>
"We vampires have the Mystic Eyes of Enchantment. This is the fundamental and the most powerful.......in the existence of vampires, Mystic Eyes other than Enchantment are not very meaningful."
<Page26>
"The enchanted eye doesn't enchant the person who sees it, it enchants the person who looks into the vampire's eyes.
Powerful vampires can use their Mystic Eyes to tap into a person's brain and take complete control of their thoughts.......well, Dead Apostles who possess that level of Mystic Eyes are rare."
<Page27>
......hmm.
It's like brainwashing or hypnosis.
For example, something like "forget what you saw here".
It's true that if you have such eyes, you can cover up the murder even if a third party witnesses it.
<Page28>
"......logic aside, the point is that I shouldn't look into your eyes?"
"Yes, very good. So, when you are facing a vampire, you should not look at his face, but at the whole body.
It's suicide to make eye contact with a vampire."
<Page29>
"The next one will be mist, right?
I wonder if this can be classified as one of the two types.
The higher level is the one that really turns into a particle, a technique that diffuses one's self and becomes a phenomenon. There are only a few Dead Apostles who can do this over a wide area and for a long time."
<Page30>
"And the lowly ones are distractions.I think Kagemusha will be easier to understand.
Cautious vampires create an alter ego and put their consciousness on it to operate. When they're done, they cut off the magic that controls the alter, and it turns to dust and fizzles out, making it look like it just disappeared into a mist."
<Page31>
Mmm-hmm.
"Kagemusha" means "Shadow warrior", right?
This girl knows a lot about Japanese culture, even though she's a foreign vampire.......
<Page32>
"Turning into a wolf, or any other animal, is a byproduct of using a spell to compensate for a damaged body.
The longer a vampire lives, the harder it is for ordinary cells to make up for their decaying body. So they take in a powerful beast and use it as their body.
When necessary, the beast is returned to its original state and used, so it looks like a wolf or a werewolf."
<Page33>
"The Dead Apostles have taken at most one of the old beasts into their bodies to repair their bodies. But that's the limit. If they take in too many, the vampire's soul will become clouded by the beasts.
There is only one person among the Dead Apostles who has taken in more than one beast as a servant. #He's already gone, though."
<Page34>
"I'm not sure.
I've only given you a rough outline based on the image you gave me, but do you understand what vampires are like?"
<Page35>
"It's a rough summary, but anyway, a vampire is a species that looks like a human and has the same intellectual structure as a human.
No matter how foreign his contents are, as long as his basic form is human, he's fine as a vampire."
<Page36>
"........."
In fact, I'm getting more and more confused.
I know how monstrous vampires are, but that's why I can't believe that the girl in front of me is a vampire.......

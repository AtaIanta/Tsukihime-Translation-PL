"First, let's divide them into different types.
Although they're all regarded as vampires in general, they can be categorised into two groups."
<Page2>
"Those that were vampires originally and those that turned into vampires.
The former are known as True Ancestors and the latter are called Dead Apostles."
<Page3>
"The ones that you people call vampires would be Dead Apostles.
The talk about the hierarchy earlier was also about the ecology of Dead Apostles. They suck human blood, make servants of them, are weak to sunlight and are defeated before a baptismal ritual.
Our enemy is also a vampire that would be classified as a Dead Apostle."
<Page4>
At some point, her phrasing changed from "my enemy" to "our enemy". I wanted to point this out, but it's not wrong at this point, so I'll let it pass.
<Page5>
"......Hmm. You said that Dead Apostles weren't vampires from the beginning, what did you mean by that?"
<Page6>
"Dead Apostles are originally things like humans, animals and anything else that weren't vampires from the start.
Some are immortalized by Magic, while others have their blood sucked and become servants.
Well, in either case, the result is basically the same.
Those who become vampires gain an imperfect but immortal body and are removed from the human category."
<Page7>
"............"
So there are two types of vampires: the True Ancestors, who were vampires from the beginning, 
and Dead Apostles, who were turned from humans to vampires.
......But something's off.
I feel like there is a discrepancy or a structural contradiction from what she said.
<Page8>
"Hey Shiki. How much do you know about the characteristics of vampires?"
<Page9>
"I only know the basics.
The common image of vampires is that they suck the blood of virgins, paralyze others with just a stare, turn themselves into mist, or turn themselves into wolves....... This is all just based on stuff that I've heard."
<Page10>
"Yes, everything you said is pretty much right.
The reason why they suck the blood of virgins is because their blood, which has not been exchanged with other humans yet, is suitable for replenishing their genes. The main difference is that it is more nutritious compared to regular blood."
<Page11>
"Dead Apostles---those who turned into vampires---are imperfectly immortal. It is true that as an immortal, they have transformed into a life form with dynamic cells that are difficult to kill.
However, just like a burning flame, they must constantly replenish their energy or else they will be extinguished."
<Page12>
"All living thing needs to be nourished in order to function, right? It's the same thing. The only difference is that vampires lose their lifespan as long as they continue to consume blood."
<Page13>
"Dead Apostles, or those that have turned into vampires, suck blood because they need it to survive.
They were originally human, so it's impossible for them to have an immortal body."
<Page14>
"The longer they live, the more power they gain and the less the genes that make up their bodies can withstand the growth of atoms. If they don't continue to increase their strength, they will collapse, but if they increase their strength too much, they will not be able to maintain their own shape."
<Page15>
"So what do they do to make up for it?
It's simple. They take in the normal ones from elsewhere, not the abnormal ones like they have, and supplement the ones that are disappearing."
<Page16>
"The same way that humans prefer organic compounds in their diet.
Vampires gather their normal genetic information and caloric value from blood. The soul's calorific value, if you will."
<Page17>
"In other words, they fix their own bodies by sucking human blood and taking in their genetic information.
For the Dead Apostles, bloodsucking is not only a way to feed and pool their power, but it is also an essential part of their existence."
<Page18>
"............"
How complicated. Not to mention long.
Despite not catching up with all the information, Arcueid continues to talk without a care.
<Page19>
"Now the next point is...... the one about paralyzing just from staring right?
This is what is known as "Mystic Eyes".
The eyeball is a useful and powerful Magic Circuit, so there are many vampires that have the Mystic Eyes.
<Page20>
It might be easier to think of it as a "Directional magic release function". #What comes out of an eye..... a beam? Just think of it like that."
<Page21>
"Wait, they have that, a beam!?"
I can't help but lean forward at the appearance of such a ridiculous word.
<Page22>
"Huh...!? Well...I mean, it's not an actual beam.
There's no way there are any vampires that can actually do something that ridiculous. It's just a mental image. A way to visualize."
I see. That's both good and disappointing.
<Page23>
"But besides that, what is a Mystic Eye exactly?"
"It's a special type of eye. It uses Magic Circuits to release a single-action magic....... I guess you could think of it like a technique."
<Page24>
"I mean, humans have things like fencing right? It's the same as that.
There are many different types, but it's a technique that can be used by any Dead Apostle. However, even if they were to train the technique, the power depends on the individual differences and talents of the user."
<Page25>
"The ones that we vampires have are the Mystic Eyes of Enchantment. Although fundamentally it's the most powerful.......in the world of vampires, Mystic Eyes outside of Enchantment are considered pretty useless."
<Page26>
"These Mystic Eyes of Enchantment don't enchant the person it sees, but it enchants the person who looks into the vampire's eyes.
Powerful vampires can use their Mystic Eyes to tap into a person's brain and take complete control of their thoughts....... Although, Dead Apostles who possess that level of Mystic Eyes are rare."
<Page27>
......Hmm.
So it's something like brainwashing or hypnosis.
You could order someone to "Forget what you saw here" for example.
It's true that if you have such eyes, you could easily cover up a murder even if a third party witnesses it.
<Page28>
"......Logic aside, the point is that I shouldn't look into these eyes, right?"
"Yes, very good. So, when you are facing a vampire, you should not look at his face but at the whole body.
Making eye contact with an enemy vampire is essentially suicide."
<Page29>
"The next point is about mist, right?
Maybe this can also be classified as two different types.
The upper class type is the one that involves actual particle transformation. It's a technique that diffuses one's self, turning one's body into a scattering phenomenon. There are only a few Dead Apostles who can do this over a wide area and for a long period of time."
<Page30>
"And then the lower class ones are deceptions. I think it's easier to think of it like Kagemusha.
Cautious vampires create a clone and place their consciousness on it to operate. After finishing their task, they cut off the magic controlling the clone, causing it turn to dust and fizzle out and thus making it look like it just disappeared into a mist."
<Page31>
Mmm-hmm.
"Kagemusha" means "Shadow warrior", right?
This foreigner...... no, this foreign vampire knows quite a lot about Japanese culture for an outsider.
<Page32>
"Turning into a wolf, or any other animal for that matter, is a byproduct of using a spell to compensate for a damaged body.
The longer a vampire lives, the harder it is for ordinary cells to make up for their decaying body. That's why they capture a powerful beast and use it as their body.
When necessary, the beast is returned to its original state and tamed, which makes it look like it 'turned into a wolf' or 'had a wolf come out'."
<Page33>
"The Dead Apostles take at most one of the old beasts into their bodies to repair their life force. But that's the limit. If they take in too many, the vampire's soul will become clouded by the beasts.
There has only one vampire among the Dead Apostles who has taken in more than one beast as a servant. #Although that vampire is already gone."
<Page34>
"Well, I think that wraps it up.
I've only given you a rough outline based on the image you gave me, but do you understand what vampires are like now?"
<Page35>
"It's a rough summary, but generally speaking, a vampire is a species that looks like a human and has the same intellectual structure as a human.
No matter how foreign his contents are, as long as his basic form is human, there is no problem with being a vampire."
<Page36>
"........."
In fact, I'm getting more and more confused.
I understand how monstrous these so-called vampires can be, but that's why I can't believe that the girl in front of me is a vampire.......

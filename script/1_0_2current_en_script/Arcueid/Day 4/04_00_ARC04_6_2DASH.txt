---------White.
         A dazzling white.
         The color evokes nostalgic memories.
<Page2>
A hot summer day.
<Page3>
A blue sky and a huge crescent cloud.
The slowly wavering landscape
and the sound of cicadas that makes me feel faint.
The sound of cicadas.
In my hands, there's a reddish sheen as if paint had been splashed on them.
<Page4>
*chirp* *chirp* *chirp*
*chirp* *chirp* *chirp*
*chirp* *chirp* *chirp*
The husks of cicadas in the square.
The square is slowly being burned away,
as if the sun was right next to us.
<Page5>
A hot day in the middle of summer.
It's as if the world had turned into a frypan.
<Page6>
Uwah....waah..
Uwah....waah..
Uwah....waah..
Akiha is crying.
Akiha, who had always been quiet and followed me around, is overflowing with tears.
<Page7>
Apart from Akiha, there is one other child lying on the ground.
The rays of the sun bounce off my slimy hands.
Ah. These hands...                 are cold.
The collapsed child                is cold.
The blood flowing out is red.     It's warm.
<Page8>
"Shiki-----"
The adults are coming.
The collapsed child is dead.
The adults are screaming.
They shout at me, asking me if I had killed him.
<Page9>
---I had seen a dream, a dream which I had forgotten even amongst other dreams.
<Page10>
"Shiki. Come on, wake up.
The sun has already gone down."
<Page11>
My body is being shaken violently.
...... A not-so-familiar voice and the feeling of cold hands on my shoulder.
<Page12>
Arcueid is in front of me.
It's pitch black outside the window.
I look at my watch and see that it's around eight o'clock in the evening.
<Page13>
"............ Huh?"
"Don't give me that 'huh'. I told you to wake me up when the sun goes down, but you just fell asleep.
<Page14>
"...... Sorry. I guess I fell asleep."
...... How pathetic. To think that I fell asleep while looking at Arcueid's sleeping face......
<Page15>
"Seriously. That's no way to be an escort.
To think that we were both asleep, we would have both died if we had been attacked during that time."
<Page16>
"I already told you I'm sorry. But I mean, weren't you the one that said it's safe during the day?"
"You can never know for certain. There are cases like the familiars from this morning after all."
<Page17>
Arcueid is angry.
Of course, it's entirely my fault.
For someone that's supposed to stand guard to be sleeping together, I might as well be worse than a scarecrow.
<Page18>
"And besides, I'm a vampire too, Shiki.
And yet despite this, you were somehow able to fall asleep without feeling any sense of danger. Wouldn't it more sense for you to be so nervous that you can't sleep, be in awe or something like that?"
<Page19>
"-------"
......... Perhaps the phrase "Entirely my fault" is a bit too far.
This girl seems to be more upset that I was sleeping peacefully than the fact that I wasn't on guard duty.
<Page20>
"When I woke up being after being able to move my body a bit more, I found you there, sleeping happily.
You were so defenseless that I was seriously starting to worry that you might not have the respect for me as a vampire."
<Page21>
"What? You were just as vulnerable as I was.
You know, I've already killed you once before. And yet here you are, sleeping soundly like a princess without any guarantee that I wouldn't do it again. Don't underestimate me just because I'm a human."
<Page22>
I retort back, reminding her that a cornered rat will bite back at a cat.
It was basically an agonizing attempt at an excuse.

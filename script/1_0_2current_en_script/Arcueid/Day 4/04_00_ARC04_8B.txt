The night is drawing to a close.
While Arcueid is sitting down on the bed,
I sit on the sofa, aimlessly staring at the clock.
<Page2>
The time is a little after four in the morning.
It is only an hour before dawn.
<Page3>
"One more hour, huh?"
There hasn't been anything unusual so far, and Arcueid herself hasn't shown any signs of being nervous.
The hotel is completely peaceful.
<Page4>
...In a sense, I still feel some form of tension, but it seems that the overwhelming worries have come to an end.
For some reason or another, I have a feeling that this night will continue like this until the end.
<Page5>
"Hey, Shiki."
And thus, Arcueid calls out to me for the umpteenth time.
<Page6>
"What do you want? There's nothing for us to talk about anymore."
"Are you sure? Since we're here, it'd be a waste to just sit there and do nothing."
<Page7>
"...Arcueid, how long do you think we've been talking up until now?
It's been six hours. Six. If you had to ask me what was tiring, it would be the hours spent talking to you rather than the fact I'm standing guard."
<Page8>
Arcueid glares at me with displeasure.
That's right.
For whatever reason, Arcueid is talking to me a lot.
<Page9>
If you feel weak, then you're better off going to sleep,
"Because it's more fun to talk."
or so she says. Inevitably, the two of us end up facing each other.
<Page10>
".....Hah."
I really don't understand what goes through this person's head.
To make matters worse, my stomach is feeling hungry.
Now that I think about it, I haven't eaten anything for an entire day since breakfast yesterday.
<Page11>
"If you're hungry, why don't you eat something?
Since we've come all this way to stay at a hotel, you could have just ordered some room service."
<Page12>
"No thanks, that would lower my tension. Rather, shouldn't you be the one that needs to eat something? Since you're weak and you're not falling asleep, you should have a meal at the very least."
<Page13>
"If you don't eat then I won't eat either.
Of course, there's some value in having a normal meal, but it would be boring to just be eating alone."
<Page14>
"A normal meal? I don't think meals are particularly normal or special―――"
...Oh, that's right.
It doesn't look like it at all, but Arcueid is supposed to be a vampire.
If that's the case, then sucking human blood would be her way of having a 'meal'.
<Page15>
Arcueid did say that vampires need human blood in order to survive.
By that logic―――whose blood has this girl sucked until now, and consequently, how many humans has she killed?
<Page16>
"――――"
I take a quick glance at Arcueid's face.
...This is ridiculous.
Even though it has been explained to me numerous times that she was a vampire, how did I not come to realize the fact that this person would suck blood as a result―――
<Page17>
"What? Is there something on my face?"
"...!"
I look away in panic.
Arcueid stares deeply into my face,# and lets out a smile as if she had discovered something profound.
<Page18>
"You're curious, right?"
"A-About what?"
"About how many people's blood I've sucked until now. Do you want to know?"
"Ngh..."
<Page19>
...She has completely seen through my thoughts.
Arcueid's smile extends so far that it makes me somewhat uncomfortable.
I don't like the feel of this―――but despite this, I can't help but wonder how many people this girl has killed until now.
<Page20>
"...That's right, I'm curious. I'm working with you after all.
If I don't know even that much, I wouldn't be able to predict when you would change your mind and attack me."
<Page21>
That is a real issue.
Arcueid shows signs of having understood my argument.
<Page22>
"In that case, here's a question.
How many people's blood do you think I have sucked so far?"
<Page23>
With a tap, Arcueid springs lightly from the bed and walks near the window.
<Page24>
"How many? That's―――"
Arcueid smirks and looks at me with amusement as I fall silent.
It's obvious that she's trying to provoke me.
<Page25>
...Fine, I'll give you a straight answer.
Since we're talking about this weird girl, I'm sure she's sucked―――
C:>Ten people...?
C:>A hundred...?
C:>A thousand...?

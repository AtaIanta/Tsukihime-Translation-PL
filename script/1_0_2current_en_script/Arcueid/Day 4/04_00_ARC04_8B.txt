The night is drawing to a close.
Arcueid is sitting down on the bed,
I sit on the sofa and stare at the clock.
<Page2>
The time is a little after four in the morning.
It's only an hour before dawn.
<Page3>
"One more hour, huh?"
There's nothing unusual so far, and Arcueid herself doesn't even seem nervous.
The hotel is completely peaceful.
<Page4>
......I was reasonably nervous, but it looks like that will end up being a setback.
I have a feeling that this will pass tonight.
<Page5>
"Hey, Shiki."
Arcueid calls out for the umpteenth time.
<Page6>
"What? I don't have anything to say to you anymore, so..."
"Is that so? It's a waste of time to do this."
<Page7>
"......you know what? How long do you think we've been chatting?
Six hours. What's tiring is that I'm more tired from that than I am from being on watch."
<Page8>
Arcueid glares at me in frustration.
That's about it.
For some reason, Arcueid is talking to me a lot.
<Page9>
If you're weak, why don't you just sleep?
"Because it's more fun to talk."
The two of us end up facing each other like this.
<Page10>
".........hah."
I really don't understand what this girl is thinking.
On top of that, I'm getting hungry.
Now that I think about it, I haven't eaten anything for a whole day since yesterday's breakfast.
<Page11>
"If you're hungry, why don't you eat something?
Since we're staying at a hotel, how about you use the room service?"
<Page12>
"No, It'll take away the tension. You're the one who needs to eat something. You're weak right now, you should at least eat."
<Page13>
"If you don't eat then I won't eat either.
I mean, a normal meal makes sense in its own way. But it's boring to eat alone."
<Page14>
"A normal meal is a meal that is neither normal nor special..."
......oh, that's right.
It doesn't look like it, but Arcueid is a vampire.
If that's the case, then sucking human blood is a "meal" for her too.
<Page15>
Arcueid said that vampires need human blood to live.
So...whose blood has this girl sucked and how many humans has she killed?
<Page16>
"----"
I glance at Arcueid's face.
......this is ridiculous.
It's been explained to me over and over that she's a vampire, but somehow I can't imagine her sucking human blood...
<Page17>
"What? Is there something on my face?"
"......!"
I look away in panic.
Arcueid stares at my face, #and smiles in a different way than before.
<Page18>
"Are you curious?"
"What?"
"Are you wondering how many humans I've sucked blood from?"
"Ngh......"
<Page19>
......she has completely seen through my thoughts.
Arcueid's smile is full of generosity, and I kind of don't like it.
I don't like it---but more than that, I can't help but wonder how many people this girl has killed in her life.
<Page20>
"......that's right, I'm curious. I'm working with you.
If I don't know that, I won't be able to predict when you'd change your mind and attack me."
<Page21>
Arcuied agrees and says..
'I see, that's a real problem'.
<Page22>
"Here's a question for you.
How many people's blood have I sucked so far?"
<Page23>
With a tap, Arcueid leaps lightly from the bed and walks to the window.
<Page24>
"How many, that's..."
Arcueid smirks and looks at me with amusement as I fall silent.
It's an obvious provocation.
<Page25>
......sure, I'll give you a straight answer.
I'm sure this weird girl has sucked...
C:>Ten people......?
C:>A hundred......?
C:>A thousand......?

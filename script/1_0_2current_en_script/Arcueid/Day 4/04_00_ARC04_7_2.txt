......Suspicious.
The fact that she says she won't break it is extremely suspicious.

"--- You can't even look.
I've seen your stupidity in the back alley. I can't help you if you get killed by accident."
<Page3>
"What do you mean, stupidy? It's only natural when you're in the alleyway, you've raised your power like that.

"Oh, you're running away."
"That's right, I'm running. I'm getting used to your recklessness, but I'm not giving you these glasses.

"Yes, yes, I'm stingy. I can't come back to life, so I'm cautious about everything.
...... Besides, if I lose these glasses, I won't be able to help you. If I see the lines all the time, I'm going to get headaches."

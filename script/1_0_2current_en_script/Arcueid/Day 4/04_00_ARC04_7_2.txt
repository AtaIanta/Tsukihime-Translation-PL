...How suspicious.
The fact that she says she won't break it is extremely suspicious.

"―――I can't allow you to even look.
I've seen your crazy brute strength in the back alley. I can't risk the chance that you would do something and break it."
<Page3>
"What do you mean 'crazy brute strength'? Of course I would use that level of strength, it was only natural for that time at the back alley.

"Oh, you're running away."
"Of course I'm running. Even though I'm getting used to your recklessness, there's no way I'm handing over these glasses.

Hmph. Fine, I get it. Stingy Shiki."
It seems that she was just curious about something I valued. What is she, a child?
<Page8>
"Alright, fine, I'm stingy. Humans can't come back to life, so I'm cautious about everything.
...Besides, if I lose these glasses, you can basically say goodbye to us working together. If I get headaches from seeing the lines all the time, who knows what will happen to my mind."

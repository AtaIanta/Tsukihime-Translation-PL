"What is...this place...?"
A voice echoes in the darkness.
The air is damp. The smell of rot that makes you want to cry. A darkness in which she could not see an inch. All of it melts her intellect.
<Page2>
"What the hell is this place...?"
The girl cannot remember what happened a few minutes ago.
She can't even remember where she was.
<Page3>
The girl vaguely remembers hearing the voices of men.
She also remembers going down of her own free will.
She also feels like she used an elevator.
On the way down, she realized that this was not an urban legend, but the truth about this city that she really shouldn't get involved in, and started pressing the stop button desperately.
<Page4>
"Where the hell am I―――!"
But that's already in the past.
Time is irreversible for humans. It is asymmetric. As long as there is no symmetry, there is no way to go back to the past from the present.
<Page5>
That's how it is.
Before she knew it, she was in the middle of hell.
<Page6>
"Ah...ah, ah, ah...!"
Frightened by the darkness, she puts her hands on the wall. Rotten juice clinging to her fingers. Fishy. Soft. Knowing that it's the remains of human guts splattered all over the place, she crawls her fingers, crying.
Because if she doesn't, she won't be able to move on.
She can't move towards the darkness.
She can't escape the sound of footsteps that have been following her since a while ago.
<Page7>
"No, no, no, no, no...!"
She can do nothing but walk around with her face twisted into a crumpled mess as she scrapes out the guts.
"Hee...!"
Every time I move forward, I hear a scream from within the walls, like metal grinding together.
<Page8>
"Aah, aaaah, aaaaaahaah!"
"Are you human? Hey, don't go! Don't leave me...!"
"Mommy....mommy...."
"Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out!"
<Page9>
"Hii...aaaaaaaa, haaaaaaaaaahh!"
She can't believe it's the voice of the same species.
It's a scream that seems to burst their throats and lungs. They continue to raise their voices without any concern of the damage it causes.
<Page10>
But their bodies are beyond help.
Without limbs, they hang from the ceiling like a bagworm moth.
<Page11>
"No, no, I don't want to die, I don't want to die...!"
She ignores the pleas of the things that are already done for and runs away.
Light. For now, she needed a light. Because with that, she would be able to escape.
<Page12>
The male guides said that there was a goal in the midst of their laughter.
In that case, there must be a way out.
That is the only path to survival. Even though she's aware that this is a lie, her remaining sanity continues to cling to that hope.
<Page13>
"Light...light, light, light...!"
She turns her head back frequently.
Then it occurs to her that she didn't come alone.
I must have come with my lover. That stupid man had brought this up. That's why I said I'd give it a try, just for fun. It's all his fault. I hope he dies. I hope he dies soon. Let him die before me. And then I'll be alive. I'm the only one who's gonna make it. Because I'm special.
I've done nothing wrong. There's no reason for this to happen to me. This kind of thing is reserved for people who are more vulgar and dumber than me or more fortunate and lucky than me. I'm not involved. I'm not involved. I've lived a good life. I've lived a pretty normal life. I'm gonna live a pretty normal life. So it should be someone else who should be going through this...
<Page14>
"Huh...? #"
The dim light vanishes. Darkness fills the room.
And in it,
she sees herself burning.
<Page15>
"What's this...my hands are all torn up like ashes."
The arm she stretched out against the wall has already been erased up to her elbow.
She looks down at her body in a panic, her clothes have long since been burned, her skin charred, her internal organs and flesh exposed.
The grease of the flesh is burning so red that it's hard to look at.
<Page16>
"Thank God", she says as she laughs.
After all,
she finally has a light.
<Page17>
"Aha...I'm on fire...this is amazing!
Look at me, I'm on fire, I'm on fire, ahahahahahaha!"
A human body laughing loudly.
A human torch illuminating the darkness.
And then,
a single, piercing blow of mercy.
<Page18>
"Sa...sa..sa.....sa...sa....sav...save me―――"
She burns up, spewing out boiling blood.
As if to savor the warmth, he drinks down the fresh blood.
<Page19>
Hell reverts back to its original darkness.
He finishes his minimal meal and crosses the hell that is absent of its master.
Behind him are countless corpses.
The people who wandered into the cemetery and the dead who used to inhabit it are all equally reduced to ashes by the flames of the river.
<Page20>
"―――It's cold here."
<Page21>
It's so cold that even his breath exhales smoke.
Leaving behind a red trail like a slug, it heads towards the ground above at a slow pace.
"―――The heart of the True Ancestor, shall be mine."
 
All in order to hunt down the mouth-watering prey that his servants had just discovered.

<Page1>
'Ding'.
There was a loud sound, terribly out of place.
"Ele......vator......?"
Another box arrives, this one next to the previous one.
My exhausted brain does not reflect on what it means.
<Page2>
The door opens.
Even though my mind was not working properly, my body automatically brought the knife back to my right hand and stood up to face the tragedy that would happen "after this".
<Page3>
...... Ah, so disgusting.
Once again, the iron box opens.
Inside it, there is...
<Page4>
"------nothing?"
There was nothing in it.
<Page5>
...... Another disappointment, I guess you could say.
The danger is over.
Even though it was all over, I could see what was going on downstairs.
So there's no reason for me to stay here, I said as I was about to turn on my Heel.
<Page6>
"Ah, ha, who, who, who, who, who, who, who!"
The woman's voice sounded inexplicably ridiculous.
The voice grew louder with the sound of footsteps.
<Page7>
There's no doubt about it.
From the stairs of the elevator hall, a survivor comes running up, gasping for breath. ......!
<Page8>
"Ha, ha, ha...... that's it, it's not burning here......!"
I can hear the shouts of delight.
The sound of shoes never stops.
The source of the voice appears in the elevator hall, rolling.
<Page9>
"You!Hey, you there!"
She notices me in the hallway and starts running again.
<Page10>
"Yay, I'm saved. ......!I'm saved. ......!"
Her face, which had been tense with fear, begins to glow with joy.
<Page11>
"What ......?"
A pale hand pulls that hope back to hell.
"No. ...... No, no, no, no!"
A woman's voice begging for help, still looking at me.
<Page12>
There was no resistance.
There was no restraint.
As soon as her hands grabbed me, she lost consciousness, like waking up from a dream.
<Page13>
---Stop it.
---Stop it.
---The woman. #---She had nothing to do with it, #she was a good person,
---You can't just prey on her.
<Page14>
"Stop!"
You can't stop it in time.
Even if it reaches you, it won't change.
<Page15>
I stare at the woman's neck.
Stars seem to scatter in my eyes.
My vision becomes clear with unprecedented rage.
Two bottomless evil eyes spinning in rage.
<Page16>
The woman's limbs twitching and twitching.
"...... ah,ah---"
The woman's face loses all emotion and vitality.
<Page17>
It must have been the first time she saw it.
but she didn't need to be told what it was.
<Page18>
I can even hear her gurgling.
After he had enjoyed the woman for a while, he carelessly abandoned her.
The woman wavered like a dead tree.
A ballerina dancing on the brink of death.
On her pathetic back
<Page19>
There was no scream.
Only the sound of bloodshed echoed through the air.
Her back cracked.
A spray of blood.
The vampires breathed a sigh of relief as he was bathed in it.
<Page20>
The world changes completely.
The physical temperature and reality finally match.
A film of flame envelops the corridor.
Like a river rushing through a weir.
<Page21>
My skin is burning.
If I breathe now, my lungs will surely be burned.
<Page22>
But something's wrong.
It's burning. The flames are definitely flickering.
And yet the building is not burning.
Only I, the creature, can feel this flame.
<Page23>
I have a headache.
It's starting to walk towards me.
He's the source of the river of fire.
The closer he gets, the hotter the atmosphere gets.
<Page24>
It's only 15 meters now.
Even at this distance I can't breathe.
That means I will die just by getting close to it.
<Page25>
A slender shadow walks toward me.
A strange appearance.Elegant clothes and a savage cloak.
A human form, but clearly not human.
Everything's off. It's crazy.
Thirteen meters.
He's coming towards me silently.
<Page26>
"---"
I start at him with the knife.
No response. I wonder if he can see me in the first place.
Ten meters.
I stare at him.
I see the line of death in the boiling flames.
<Page27>
"---"
The inside of my skull boils like soup.
<Page28>
What is that?.
A complex, tangled, swirling, dense torrent of death.
Like a jewel, shining brightly in the midst of it all.
<Page29>
"Hz......!"
I turn away from the headache.
That's not good. It's not good to keep looking at that man "in the middle".
Like looking directly at the sun burns your retina.
My brain will explode if I look at it without preparation.
<Page30>
Eight meters.
The distance is getting closer.
The temperature is rising. But it's not hot enough to kill me yet.
<Page31>
6 meters.
At that distance he stops.
His gaze focuses on me. This close, the man finally notices me.
<Page32>
---Our gazes meet.
This eye is not well.
The white woman's warning flashes through my mind.
But I can't make eye contact with him.
But I can't ignore him either.
<Page33>
That's not it. It must be fundamentally different from the demon's eye that the white woman was talking about. This eye doesn't have the power to bind the beholder. Because it is the eye of madness. It's the eye of a madman. The eyes of a maniacal thing... an ugly, miserable, impulsive thing, a bastard just like me, driven by its own abnormalities.
<Page34>
"......!"
My instincts tell me I'm in danger.
It's not good, my instincts are triggered.
But my body still won't move. Not one fingertip responds properly.
<Page35>
Danger signals bounce around my skull.
No matter what means or methods I use, I must get away from here immediately or my life will be ended.
<Page36>
---But it's too late.
The one with the diseased eyes never paid any attention to me,
It burned me to death with its hands.
<Page37>
"----"
Dead.
Because those flames are real.
The blue flames that wet the hallway are an effect on top of reality.
Even if you are swallowed by it, you will not die instantly. Perhaps it's like a visionary pain that only scorches life.
<Page38>
But this is different.
These flames are real. Just getting close to it burns your skin. Life carbonizes at it's touch.
It has been released in the form of sharp claws.
<Page39>
My body was cut in two and burned from the severed side.
A certainty clearer than fire.
And yet, just before that,
<Page40>
I was pulled backwards with a thud.
<Page41>
"---Arcueid......?"
The question escaped from my throat in a voice.
My thoughts went blank.
<Page42>
I know what's going on.
I was pulled back by Arcueid, and at the same time, this thing stepped in front of me and received that "hand".
<Page43>
That action made too much sense to me.
It was supposed to be my role to shield her.
So why is this person hurting herself by protecting me......?
<Page44>
"Ahh ----!"
Arcueid's face twisted in pain.
<Page45>
A hand of flame reaches out again and again.
No need to pull me this time.
Arcueid swings her right hand to blow away the flames, just as she did in the alleyway.
<Page46>
But it's not perfect.
The flames could not be extinguished, and the aftermath scorched her skin.
You can't possibly be saying that a direct hit will burn even Arcueid,......?
<Page47>
Are the flames hot enough to lethally damage a woman that has minimal death lines and is so far away from death.
<Page48>
This happened in just five seconds.
The number of shots fired and intercepted was about ten.
For whatever reason, the man solemly lowered his arms.
<Page49>
"............"
The man stared at Arcueid in silence.
her belly flushed red as she stared back at the man in agony.
<Page50>
The man only has Arcueid in his sight.
He treated me, who was protected by her and holding a knife behind her, as if I were completely "nothing".
<Page51>
"..............."
Steam rises from the man's mouth.
After a breath as if to exhaust himself, he reached under his coat with his left hand.
<Page52>
I heard a faint metallic click.
There's no doubt about it. A blade.
There's a long object hidden under that coat. It's probably the one that slashed the woman in front of the elevator.
<Page53>
The man's legs move.
With the blade hidden under his coat, he is about to take a step towards Arcueid.
<Page54>
"Rude. If you're not a pig, speak you name.
Or were your parents too lazy to teach you even the most basic of manners?"
"------"
<Page55>
The man's feet stopped.
The light of his ego lights up in his ghostly eyes.
The man gasped in response to Arcueid's ...... words, some of which I did not understand.
It was as if he had forgotten that he was a living being until now, with a voice full of pain.
<Page56>
"...... I know the etiquette.
But I don't have a name to tell you yet."
<Page57>
"You have no manners, but you have enough shame.
You may have lost your original name, or ......, but you still have a name to call yourself, don't you?You may have just inherited it, but it's still temporary."
<Page58>
...... The air changes.
The blue flames that burned in the corridor increased in intensity.
Had Arcueid's words struck a nerve that the man could not bear?
<Page59>
""---Vlov.""
The fire-spewing vampire growled in annoyance,
""Vlov Arkhangel.""
He said his name.
<Page60>
"A name I do not know. As I have no record of him, he cannot be the rightful heir. Could it be that my parents destroyed him?
""...... Not so. I'm the one who killed him."
<Page61>
"You're the new ancestor.
So now you want to kill?"
""...... Honor is what you make it.
I will only take what I want."
<Page62>
"Your attitude is admirable, but you should limit it to me.
This is a bit much."
""...... No. This city is tainted.
If I don't burn it down, it's inimical to my beliefs."
"Oh, yes. In other words, you're a third-rate mortal who's no better than a barbarian."
<Page63>
""I'm aware that I'm ......coarse.
Princess of the True Ancestors. I will take your heart."
<Page64>
"......!"
Vlov. The vampire's surroundings distort as he calls himself that.
A "river of flame" overflows from around him.
Arcueid's body acts like a shield that prevents me from being swallowed by the torrent.
<Page65>
"...... Don't move, Shiki. This flame is his weapon.
If you don't want to be charred, stay behind me."
<Page66>
I appreciated the advice, but I had an uncomfortable feeling I couldn't put into words.
...... This is his weapon?Really?
Because after creating such a high temperature condition, the main body of that thing looks like...
<Page67>
No, now is not the time.
Concentrate your attention and hold the knife.
<Page68>
---It's coming.
The corridor is now a cave of fire.
Vlov unleashes the blade under his coat right now...
<Page69>
"What about ......?"
---.
He suddenly turns his back on us.
<Page70>
He walked to the hall as if nothing had happened, got on the elevator without a care in the world, and left this floor.
<Page71>
"Na---"
I don't understand any of this anymore. ......!
Not the two dogs that attacked me, not the flames that covered the corridor, not the nightmarish reality that hit this hotel!
<Page72>
"Shi---you."
With a thud, Arcueid leaned in.
...... It's a nasty wound. The bleeding from her stomach had stopped, but her face was contorted in pain.
<Page73>
---That was only a few seconds ago.
It was the wound she got from defending me from that guy.
<Page74>
"Yeah, ...... you, why ......?"
<Page75>
"......Yes, I underestimated you a bit.
I thought I could save you and get away with it if I had to #...# You're the best, Shiki.
Your scratch doesn't look so good, shiki.
<Page76>
Arcueid smiled jokingly, her face contorted in pain.
<Page77>
"------"
I can't watch.
I don't know what to say to her when she gives me that stupid smile.
<Page78>
Arcueid leans her body against mine and tries to close her eyes.
<Page79>
"Wait a minute, what are you doing closing your eyes, you idiot!
You're a vampire who doesn't die at night, aren't you?
<Page80>
"......Yeah, ......but ......I'm kind of.. at my limit."
"Now ----"
"I'm sorry, but you have to take me back to my room."
<Page81>
Arcueid collapses.
Her weight falls on my arm as I hold her.
"---Wait a minute, no..."
If you die on your own, I really won't know what to give back to you. ......!
<Page82>
"No, wake up, Arcueid. ......!"
I call out to Arcueid, who closes her eyes quietly.
And.
"...... Koo!"
I could hear her sleeping so happily that I felt foolish for having said that a second ago.
<Page83>
"............"
...... I was so worried I lost it.
Apparently Arcueid is just asleep.
<Page84>
"...... Huh. Take me to my room, you selfish bastard..."
But in this case, it can't be helped.
In the first place, it's not good to stay in the hotel any longer.
<Page85>
...... It's such a tragedy.
Even if no abnormalities are leaked outside, sooner or later they will be known.
<Page86>
"............ggh."
The headache won't stop.
I'm at the end of my rope.
I'm going to put on my glasses to at least ease the headache.
<Page87>
"...... Arcueid's room... oh, there it is."
<Page88>
I've only been there once, but I definitely remember the place.
Then don't stay long.
I retrieved my luggage from the royal suite, took Arcueid in my arms, and left the empty hotel with a sense of shame.
<Page89>
The sky was getting brighter.
...... So, that's it.
<Page90>
The reason why the man left was this simple.
The sun was already fully up in the city.
Before he knew it, night had long since fallen.
<Page91>
...... Anyway, I should let Arcueid rest for now.
I can't get a cab.
I'm sure he'll recognize these two shady characters.
<Page92>
As far away from the hotel as possible, I boarded a bus bound for Sohya Station.
Fortunately, it was early in the morning and we did not attract any attention.
<Page93>
The emergency exit at the back of the building was still the same as the day before yesterday.
The residents and the janitor must not have noticed that the lock was "broken".
<Page94>
6:30 a.m.
I crept into the room of the self-proclaimed vampire woman, just as I had done the day before, and finally realized that the long day was over.

"Ten people... maybe that's too few...?"
"Yeah, that's not even close at all."
"Mmm. Then how about a hundred?"
"Bad luck, that's a miss again."
"Gh...! In that case, a thousand!?"
"Nope, that is also a big no-no."
<Page2>
Arcueid gives off a strange chuckle.
...I'm not angry at all, yet why do I feel so incredibly frustrated?
<Page3>
"Well, I didn't think it would be this high, but surely it's not ten thousand...?"
"That's also wrong. Ten, hundred, thousand... so this is what you really think of me huh. How awful, do you really think I'm like other vampires?"
<Page4>
"...Am I wrong? I thought all vampires were the same.
Even humans get hungry just by simply existing. So if you vampires need to suck blood in order to survive, then there would be no limit to how much you need to suck."
"That's true. What you said is right, but..."
<Page5>
"I don't think I've ever sucked blood myself in the past eight hundred years. On top of that, I've never killed an ordinary person either."
<Page6>
――――.
Even a person like me understood that this was a strange thing for a vampire to say.
But more than that,
<Page7>
"Hold on, you're joking right?"
"I'm serious. Besides, sucking blood is really scary for me."
<Page8>
"You're afraid of sucking blood, even though you're a vampire?"
"In all honesty, I'm just a coward.
That's why no matter what happens, I'll always be a half-vampire."
<Page9>
Arcueid mutters as she looks up at the night sky from the window.
The white girl continues to stare at the sky for a while longer.
Her backward appearance is so faint that it becomes blurry like an illusion.
<Page10>
"...I see. A half-vampire, huh."
I feel a sense of relief as I mutter those words.
...Huh? This feeling... Am I relieved...?
Why is that I wonder. That doesn't make any sense.
<Page11>
"What's wrong, Shiki?"
"No, it's nothing. I was just laughing at you because of how much of a cowardly chicken you are."
"Chicken? Why would I be a bird like that?"
<Page12>
Arcueid tilts her head in confusion.
The way she looks now is nothing like that of a vampire.
...That's right. Of course, I would feel that way.
Because it's clear that the person in front of me is not a bad person at all. There's no way I wouldn't be relieved.
<Page13>
In any case, if I were to believe what Arcueid says, then I have no need to worry about being killed at random.
That's why I feel safe... I feel safe, but more than that, there's a much different thing I'm relieved about.
<Page14>
...Geez, what am I thinking.
To think that my feelings would be so off the mark like feeling happy from the fact that Arcueid is only half-vampire.
<Page15>
"...Huh?"
Whether it's because the conversation with Arcueid loosened me up, I feel a sudden dizzying headache.
<Page16>
"?"
My vision goes blurry with a white haze.
This is... not the usual chronic anemia.
My consciousness is still intact.
I just have a faint headache and a strange chill―――
<Page17>
"What's wrong, Shiki?
You've got so much sweat on your forehead."
"...Sweat?"
<Page18>
As she says that, I wipe my forehead with my hand. I'm sweating so much that my hands are wet, just like Arcueid said.
...It's strange. This isn't a sauna, I shouldn't be sweating like this.
As if hurried by the anxiety that arose in my chest, I look at the digital clock that's in the room.
<Page19>
The clock reads 04:32 AM.
The temperature has dropped to 11°C due to the morning chill.
This sweating is strange at such temperature.
<Page20>
No, to begin with―――
This room feels as hot as a midsummer wave...!
<Page21>
"Arcueid. Aren't you feeling hot?"
"Not really, it's not hot enough to cause any problems in my movement. It's only a mere 38°C. Although I'm weaker than usual, my body can still handle temperatures of up to 3000°C."
<Page22>
It was stupid of me to ask her.
3,000°C? Do vampires not burn even when using a burner!?
<Page23>
...No, no time to be complaining about that.
The display on the clock has not changed from 11°C.
Either the machine is out of order or there's something wrong with my body temperature.
I look around to see if there's another thermometer,
"――――――What's that?"
My eyes are glued to the monitor installed in the room showing the hotel lobby.
<Page24>
"It's, burning...?"
I couldn't believe my eyes.
It's was a scene that could only be seen in movies.
<Page25>
The flames spread as if oil had been sprayed on them.
A human-like figure is staggering around emitting black smoke.
A large carnivore is devouring the 'human-like figure'.
<Page26>
"Arcueid...!"
"........."
Arcueid doesn't say anything.
Is it hostility... or perhaps it's contempt?
She stares at the monitor carrying an emotion different from mine.
<Page27>
The lobby sinks into a sea of flames in less than a minute.
The fire alarms do not ring.
The thermometer remains stagnant.
My sweating doesn't stop, and my throat becomes dry from thirst just from breathing alone.
<Page28>
There was nothing left to think about.
It's an enemy. Those burning corpses from daytime―――those things have come to this hotel...!
<Page29>
"Damn it...!"
I run to the window to check on the state outside.
<Page30>
There's no change in the cityscape.
Despite the flames rising that high, none of the people outside noticed the anomaly.
There's no one coming into the hotel, nor is there anyone running out of the hotel.
<Page31>
"What the hell is going on, Arcueid?!"
"........"
<Page32>
Arcueid is stubbornly keeping her mouth shut.
<Page33>
"―――――"
Time is running out.
My body temperature is rising slowly to the point as if my skin is burning.
<Page34>
I don't know what's going on outside in the corridor.
I don't even know what's going on downstairs.
The only thing that comes to mind is a vague feeling that it's already too late.
<Page35>
Arcueid remains silent.
Could it be due to anxiety, or could it be a form of frustration?
She continues to stay still as if she's embracing herself, seemingly trying to hold something back.
<Page36>
She said something along the lines of 'I'm not leaving this room.'
It was like she was trying to say that her power was not strong enough to go out.
In that case.
What should I be doing in this situation?
C:>I'm going to leave the room and check outside.
C:>I'll stay in the room and see what happens.

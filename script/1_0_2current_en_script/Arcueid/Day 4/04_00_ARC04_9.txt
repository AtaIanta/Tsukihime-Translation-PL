"Ten people......no it can't be that much."
"Yes, you are not close."
"Mmm. Hundreds, then?"
"Sorry, that's a miss again."
"Gosh......! So it's a thousand?
"Yeah, that's a big no-no, too."
<Page2>
Arcueid chuckles.
......I'm not angry at all, but why do I feel so frustrated?
<Page3>
"Well, I don't think it's possible but maybe a million.......?"
"That's a miss too, tens and hundreds and thousands huh? So that's how you see me. Your selfishness knows no boundaries."
<Page4>
"......that's not true? I thought vampires didn't care about stuff like this.
You guys need blood like humans need food to survive. So shouldn't there be no limit on how many people's blood you've sucked."
"That's true but..."
<Page5>
"I don't think I've ever sucked blood in the past eight hundred years. I've never even killed an ordinary person."
<Page6>
----
I understood that this is a strange thing for a vampire to say.
But it was more than that.
<Page7>
"Is that true?"
"It's true. Because I'm afraid of sucking blood."
<Page8>
"You're afraid of sucking blood, even though you're a vampire?"
"I'm probably just a coward, that's all.
That's why I'll always be a half vampire."
<Page9>
Arcueid mutters as she looks up at the night sky from the window.
The girl in white keeps looking at the sky for a long time.
Her back is dim and hazy, like fog.
<Page10>
"......I see. Only half a vampire....."
My chest feel light.
......hmm?am I relieved. ......?
Whay is that I wonder. It's kind of strange.
<Page11>
"What's wrong, Shiki?"
"No, nothing. I'm just laughing at you because you're a cowardly chicken."
"Chicken? Why am I a bird?"
<Page12>
I wonder, says Arcueid, nodding her head.
She doesn't look like a vampire to me.
......yes. That's a natural reaction.
Because it turns out the girl in front of me is not so evil at all. How can I not be relieved?
<Page13>
At any rate, if I believe Arcueid's words, I won't be killed outright.
So I'm safe.......safe, but I'm more relieved about something else.
<Page14>
....what am I thinking....
I'm more than just happy that Arcueid is half human.
<Page15>
"......huh?"
The conversation with Arcueid loosened me up, and I feel an incoming dizzying headache.
<Page16>
"?"
My vision is blurry.
Not the usual chronic anemia.......
I'm still conscious.
I just have a faint headache and a strange chill...
<Page17>
"What's wrong, Shiki?
You've got so much sweat on your forehead."
"......sweat?"
<Page18>
I wipe my forehead with my hand. I'm sweating so much that my hands are wet.
......this is crazy. I shouldn't be sweating like this, this isn't a sauna.
As if hurried by the anxiety that arose in my chest, I look at the digital clock that's in the room.
<Page19>
The clock reads 04:32 AM.
The temperature has dropped to 11 degrees Celsius due to the morning chill.
This sweating is strange in such temperature.
<Page20>
No, to begin with...
This room seems to be as hot as midsummer.......!
<Page21>
"Arcueid. Aren't you feeling hot?"
"? It's not hot enough to cause any physical problems. It's only 38 degrees Celsius, and I can handle temperatures up to 3,000 degrees Celsius, even though I'm weak."
<Page22>
It was stupid of me to ask her.
3,000 degrees Celsius? Can't vampires burn even with a burner?
<Page23>
......no, I'm not going to complain about that right now.
The temperature display on the clock has not changed from 11 degrees Celsius.
Either the machine is out of order, or I'm experiencing something strange.
I look around the room to see if there's another thermometer,
"------what's that?"
My eyes are glued to the monitor installed in the room, which is showing the hotel lobby.
<Page24>
"It's burning......?"
I couldn't believe my eyes.
It's a scene I have only seen in <Movies|Fiction>.
<Page25>
The flames spread as if oil had been sprayed on them.
Something like a human body staggering around with black smoke.
A large carnivore devouring the "flesh".
<Page26>
"Arcueid......!"
".................."
Arcueid doesn't say anything.
Is it hostility......or contempt?
She's looking at the monitor with a different emotion than I am.
<Page27>
The lobby sinks into a sea of flames in less than a minute.
No fire alarm sounds.
No change in the thermometer.
My sweating doesn't stop, and I'm so thirsty I can barely breathe.
<Page28>
I don't need to think anymore.
The enemy. That burning corpse from daytime--has come to this hotel.......!
<Page29>
"Damn it......!"
I run to the window to see what's out there.
<Page30>
There's no change in the cityscape.
Despite the flames, none of the people outside noticed the anomaly.
There's no one coming into the hotel, nor is there anyone running out of the hotel.
<Page31>
"What the hell is going on, Arcueid!"
"..............."
<Page32>
Arcueid is stubbornly keeping her mouth shut.
<Page33>
"-----"
Time is running out.
My body temperature is rising slowly, as if my skin is burning.
<Page34>
I can't see what's going on outside in the corridor.
I can't even see what's going on downstairs.
The only thing that comes to mind is a vague feeling that it's too late.
<Page35>
Arcueid remains silent.
Is it from anxiety or frustration?
She hugs herself, still, holding something back.
<Page36>
She said "I'm not leaving this room."
She says she won't leave this room because she doesn't have much power now.
Then.
What am I here for?
C:>I'm going to leave the room and look around outside.
C:>Look outside from the room.

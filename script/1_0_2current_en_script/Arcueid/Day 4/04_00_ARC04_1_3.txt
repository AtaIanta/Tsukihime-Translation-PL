"Oh, that's right, Akiha.
What's going on with our mansion now?"
"What do you mean by 'what's going on'?
If it is a matter of ownership, I will inherit it eventually."
<Page2>
Are the assets of the Tohno family kept by a guardian until Akiha becomes an adult?
That has nothing to do with me, so I'll let that topic slide.
<Page3>
"No, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the situation at this mansion.
It's just me, you, Kohaku-san, and Hisui, right?
I'm just wondering what's going on with the rooms you're using and stuff like that."
<Page4>
"As a general rule, all rooms except ours are locked.
Your room is on the south end of the second floor of the west wing.
My room is at the north end of the second floor of the east wing.
Hisui's room is in the middle of the second floor of the west wing.
Kohaku's room is at the north end of the first floor of the west wing."
<Page5>
"The playroom and guest rooms upstairs are closed, but they will be opened if you want to bring your friends over.
Our father's study...is locked up tight because there are still important documents inside. Even you are not allowed to enter, so please do not go there, Nii-san."
<Page6>
"I see. So basically we're using the west wing.
The east wing is used for the office, your room, and so on."
For ordinary people, this would be an extremely wide area.
<Page7>
"Nii-san?"
"How should I say this. This is like a high-class space where you have to make an appointment beforehand. I get it."
<Page8>
"... You are mostly correct, although there is a problem with the way you say it.
As for the others...right. The annex and the botanical garden are also closed, though they were open when you were here in the past.
Because we will not be able to keep them up and running for a while."
<Page9>
The annex was for lodging guests, and the botanical garden was built when Makihisa was a student.
Before he took over as the head of the family, Tohno Makihisa was devoted to agricultural science, especially thremmatology. The botanical garden is said to be a remnant of that time.
<Page10>
"You mean you've closed all the other facilities?
Oh. Then what about the pool?"
"The pool is an exception. It is only closed because it is autumn, but I will bring in a contractor and reopen it when the season starts."
<Page11>
That's good to hear.
I wasn't allowed to use it as a child, but the next summer vacation is going to be fun.

<Page1>
"I'm..."
At a loss for an answer, I look up somehow.
<Page2>
"......?"
Instantly. I see a pair of eyes.
<Page3>
"What the...?"
My slackened consciousness tightens.
The strength returns to my deflated legs, and I shift from a kneeling position to a sitting position.
<Page4>
Caught by my gaze, the girl looks back at the entrance to the alleyway.
There.
There was one creature that should not be in a human city any more than the girl who called herself a vampire.
<Page5>
"------"
The girl looks on unconcerned, but I can't keep up with her grasp of the situation.
<Page6>
It's a panther. I know that. It's an animal that even children know.
But that's assuming it's in a cage or in a picture book.
I'm experiencing firsthand how terrifying it is to face that thing without any walls in between.
<Page7>
Thin and strong limbs.
Flexible as rubber, but with muscles like steel.
The form of this creature is vastly different from that of a human being, and it is designed only to hunt its prey.
<Page8>
I am reminded of ancient memories that should have been truncated.
As a fellow creature, I stop breathing in awe and fear of its superior athletic ability.
It is a fact that I don't need to verbalize----there is no way I can coexist with this creature, much less communicate with it.
<Page9>
The black panther is over a meter long.
Even a dog, with its large size, could easily bring a human down.
But this thing, with its vicious fangs and claws, is staring at me and the girl in white just five meters away.
<Page10>
"Oh. Is that someone you know?"
"Of course not!"
I couldn't help but snap back at the stupid comment.
<Page11>
---I really am an idiot.
With that voice as a signal, the black panther jumps.
No, it runs. It's just that its speed was so fast that I only recognized it as jumping.
<Page12>
"------"
There's nothing I can do.
The black shadow strikes its fangs into my shoulder without even making me aware of its first move.
<Page13>
I see it.
Even though I knew what would happen in a second, I couldn't avoid it or even think of avoiding it.
<Page14>
"And-----?"
But the impact comes from right beside me.
Just before the black shadow took a bite out of me, I'm flung away by the white girl.
<Page15>
And with one hand, carelessly.
As soon as the girl's hand touches my side, I was thrown to the wall as if I were a basketball.
<Page16>
"Ouch......!"
I endure the pain of being slammed into the wall from behind.
<Page17>
"What are you............?"
"In front of you!"
<Page18>
The girl shouts.
I look over and see that the black panther missed me, its target and instead of crashing into the wall, it flipped around, put all four legs on the wall, and then leapt to the other side of the wall.
<Page19>
A black mass clings to the side of the building.
The black panther sticks to the wall and then turns its eyes back on me...
<Page20>
"------"
I gasp at the moment.
The trajectory of the black panther as it leaps from the wall is like a bolt of lightning.
Jumping to get in its line of fire, the girl in white flicks the lightning with one hand.
<Page21>
.......the frightening thing is that the girl's leap looked so effortless. The fact that it surpassed the speed of the black panther, yet still seemed "easy" struck a nerve in me.
<Page22>
"Hey, you remember the prior contract with me, right?
If you don't listen to me, I'll kill you."
<Page23>
Her attitude has not changed one bit.
The black panther growls menacingly and keeps a careful distance from the her.
The distance between them is about three meters.
The panther does not step forward from that distance. I'm sure he understood the difference in ability between them two.
<Page24>
That black panther is indeed a monster. A monster for humans. It only kills humans when they encounter it.
......but that girl is on another level. She is a monster to monsters. If she encounters a monster then only that monster will die.
<Page25>
The black panther observes the girl without making the slightest movement.
This is a difference in power that even I can grasp. From the point of view of a wild animal that hunts, it would be like having a huge wall in front of you.
<Page26>
"I'll talk to you later. Don't get in my way-------#"
The air about the girl changes.
The expression on her face, which was unfazed even in the face of the black beast, becomes noticeably more alert.
<Page27>
"What.........people......?
They look like passerbys.
They slowly come through the dark alleyway between buildings, into this back alley.
<Page28>
"No, don't come! There's a...."
I was about to say "There's a panther here",
when a red numbness flashes across my eyeballs.
<Page29>
"------"
I rub my eyelids with my glasses on.
Now, for sure.
I see something terrible, something cruel.
<Page30>
They don't stop.
They have neither the wild perception nor the pride of a black panther.
They move forward without hesitation, regardless of what the white girl in front of them is, even if they know that they will be crushed if they take a few more steps.
<Page31>
Because "they" don't have a brain.
They don't have a fearful heart.
No matter how you look at it, they can't possibly be alive.
<Page32>
They're burning. Black smoke is billowing out of their eyes and mouth. And yet, they're moving like that.
<Page33>
They're dead.
Those are dead men.
Waste oil spills from their outstretched hands as if they were seeking salvation.
As soon as the spilled oil hits the road, it extends a tongue of flame.
From a distance, I understand that this is stagnated blood.
<Page34>
"What is this, a new species......?"
The white girl is completely transfixed by that thing.
Three dead men, two of them reaching out for the white girl.
The other one turned his head to me, who's standing there dumbfounded, and is looking into his burning eye sockets.
<Page35>
I'm hit.
The black beast would not let such a fatal opportunity escape.
<Page36>
"......!"
A rush that surpasses the earlier leap.
This time, I can't even perceive it.
<Page37>
The black panther leans over me as if to push me down and run its fangs down my neck.
<Page38>
"Ugh......?"
My neck feels tight.
The back of my neck feels strained. I think it's the back collar of my school uniform that is being bitten and pulled......!
<Page39>
"AAAH!"
I'm pushed against the wall again.
It's a corner of a back alley. I'm taken violently into the shadows where garbage is piled up.
<Page40>
"Don't you dare treat people like garbage!"
......what am I doing?
I couldn't help but complain to the black panther that threw me there.
<Page41>
Fortunately, the black panther doesn't pursue me. Perhaps he didn't have the time to care about me.
<Page42>
Raising his posture, he looks at the girl, hiding behind some scrap wood.
The dead people finally get within three meters of the white girl, which the panther never stepped into.
Instantly.
<Page43>
The atmosphere truly screams.
The airflow generated by the movement of the girl's arms is like the shovel of a bulldozer, obliterating the three walking corpses without a trace.......

<Page1>
"I'm―――"
At a loss for words, I raise my head for some reason or another.
<Page2>
"...?"
In that instant. My gaze meets another pair of eyes.
<Page3>
"Ugh―――!"
My slackened consciousness tightens.
As strength returns to my deflated legs, I shift my body from a sitting position to a crouch.
<Page4>
Following my gaze, the girl looks back at the entrance to the alleyway.
There.
Something even more outlandish than the girl that calls herself a vampire, a creature that should not exist in a human city.
<Page5>
"――――――"
The girl looks on unconcerned, but I can't keep my grasp on the situation.
<Page6>
It's a panther. I know that. It's an animal that even children know.
But that's assuming it's in a cage or in a picture book.
I'm experiencing firsthand how terrifying it is to face that thing without any walls in between.
<Page7>
Thin and strong limbs.
Muscles as supple as rubber, but as strong as steel.
This creature is vastly different from a human being, a form designed with the sole purpose of 'hunting prey'.
<Page8>
Ancient memories that should have been long forgotten rise unbidden in my mind.
As a fellow creature, I stop breathing in awe and fear of its superior athletic ability.
It is a fact that I don't need to put into words――――there is no way I can coexist with this creature, much less come to an understanding with it.
<Page9>
The black panther is over a meter long.
Even a dog, if it were that size, could easily bring a human down.
But this thing, with its vicious fangs and claws, is staring at me and the girl in white just five meters away.
<Page10>
"Hey. Is that someone you know?"
"Of course not!"
I couldn't help but snap back at her stupid comment.
<Page11>
―――I really am an idiot.
With that voice as a signal, the black panther leaps.
No, it runs. It's just that its speed was so fast that I only recognized it as leaping.
<Page12>
"――――――"
There's nothing I can do.
Before I can even comprehend its initial movement, the black shadow sinks its fangs into my shoulder.
<Page13>
Even though I could see it.
Even though I knew what would happen in a second, I couldn't avoid it or even think of avoiding it.
<Page14>
"Ack―――――?"
However, the impact comes from right beside me.
Just before the black shadow took a bite out of me, I'm flung away by the girl in white.
<Page15>
And with one hand, carelessly.
As soon as the girl's hand touches my side, I am flung to the wall as though she had thrown me like a ball.
<Page16>
"Ouch...!"
I endure the pain of having my back slammed into the wall.
<Page17>
"What are you―――?"
"Never mind that, look in front of you!"
<Page18>
The girl shouts.
Looking over, I see that having missed me, its target, the black panther didn't crash into the wall but instead abruptly pivoted, planted all four paws on the wall and leapt across to the wall on the other side.
<Page19>
The black mass clings to the side of the building.
Just as I think the black panther has come to a stop on the wall, it once again turns it's gleaming eyes on me―――
<Page20>
"――――――"
I gasp at the split-second exchange.
The velocity of the black panther as it leaps from the wall is like a bolt of lightning.
Jumping to get in its line of fire, the girl in white flicks the lightning with one hand.
<Page21>
...The frightening thing is that the girl's leap looked so effortless. The fact that it surpassed the speed of the black panther, yet still seemed "easy" struck a nerve in me.
<Page22>
"Hey, you remember the prior contract with me, right?
If you don't listen to me, you'll get killed."
<Page23>
Her attitude has not changed one bit.
The black panther growls menacingly, but keeps a careful distance from the girl.
The distance between them is about three meters.
The panther does not step forward from that distance. I'm sure it understands the difference in ability between the two of them.
<Page24>
That black panther is indeed a monster. A monster to humans. If a human encounters such a beast, there is nothing they can do other than be killed.
...But that girl is on another level. She is a monster to monsters. Any monster that comes across her path has no choice but to accept its death.
<Page25>
The black panther observes the girl without making the slightest movement.
This is a difference in power that even I can grasp. From the point of view of a wild animal in a hunt, it would be like having a huge wall in front of you.
<Page26>
"I'll fill you in later. Don't get in my way―――――――#"
The air about the girl changes.
The expression on her face, which was unfazed even in the face of the black beast, becomes noticeably more alert.
<Page27>
"What, people...!?"
They seem like passerbys no matter how I look at it.
They slowly come through the dark gaps between buildings, into this back alley.
<Page28>
"No, don't come! There's a panther―――"
I was about to say "There's a panther here",
when a red numbness flashes across my eyeballs.
<Page29>
"――――――"
I rub my eyelids with my glasses on.
Just now,
I definitely saw something atrocious.
<Page30>
They don't stop.
They have neither the wild perception nor the pride of the black panther.
They move forward without hesitation, regardless of what the girl in white in front of them is, even if they know that they will be crushed if they take a few more steps.
<Page31>
After all, there are no brains inside these things.
They don't have a heart that can experience fear.
No matter how you look at it, there is no way that they can be alive.
<Page32>
They're burning. Black smoke is billowing out of their eyes and mouths. And yet, they're moving like that.
<Page33>
They're dead.
Those are dead people.
Their hands, outstretched as though seeking salvation, spill forth with waste oil.
As soon as the spilled oil hits the road, it extends a tongue of flame.
From a distance, I understand that this is stagnated blood.
<Page34>
"What is this, a new species...?"
The girl in white is completely transfixed by that thing.
Three dead men, two of them reaching out for the girl in white.
As I stand there dumbfounded the other one, shaking violently, turns his head towards me, with those blazing eye sockets―――
<Page35>
I'm done for.
The black beast would not let such a fatal opportunity escape.
<Page36>
"...!"
A charge that surpasses the earlier leap.
This time, I can't even perceive it.
<Page37>
The black panther leans over me as if to push me down and sink its fangs into my neck.
<Page38>
"Ugh...?"
My neck feels tight.
The back of my neck feels strained. Don't tell me it's the back collar of my school uniform that is being bitten and pulled......!
<Page39>
"AAAH!"
I'm pushed against the wall once again.
This time it's a corner of a back alley. I'm taken violently into the shadows where garbage is piled up.
<Page40>
"Y-you, stop treating people like they're garbage―――!"
...What am I doing?
I couldn't help but complain to the black panther that threw me there.
<Page41>
Fortunately, the black panther doesn't pursue me. Most likely, it doesn't have the time to care about me.
<Page42>
Straightening my posture, hiding behind some scrap wood, I look over at the girl.
The smouldering corpses finally reach the line the panther never dared cross, three meters from the girl in white.
Instantly.
<Page43>
I could have sworn the atmosphere itself let out a scream.
The airflow generated by the movement of the girl's arms is like the shovel of a bulldozer, obliterating the three walking corpses without a trace.

...... Let's stay in the room and see what happens.
As long as Arcueid can't move, it's not safe to go outside.
<Page2>
"..............."
...... Time is ticking away.
Grasping the knife with one hand, I stare at the monitor that shows nothing but flames.
<Page3>
Arcueid's eyes are closed.
Her appearance reminds me of the beauty, or rather, the strength of the moonlight earlier.
More than half a day has passed since the incident in the alleyway.
Her "power" must have returned a little.
<Page4>
.......
...................
.............................. Hot.
It's like being smothered by a flame burning in front of you.
<Page5>
It was becoming difficult to breathe.
I decided that as long as I was in this room, I would be safe, but if I did this I would die before I could do anything.
<Page6>
"............"
......Should I risk it and go outside?
It's not too late.
I should second check my decision...
<Page7>
The light is gone.
The mysterious high-temperature anomaly also ceased.
At the same time,
I heard countless knocks on the door.
<Page8>
"Shiki, are you ready?"
In a whisper,
Arcueid said that, from the darkness.
"......What... am I supposed to be ready for?"
I shouldn't have asked that.
<Page9>
------------If staying in this room was a blunder.
            Was it also a blunder to ask such a question?
<Page10>
I heard the door being broken open and turned to look at it.
<Page11>
"----!"
A moment's hesitation.
And the fact that I stepped away from the door as a safety precaution.
That was the crucial "point".
<Page12>
It was two dogs that broke down the door and entered.
Immediately after they were flung away by Alcade's claws.
An unprecedented amount of fire was injected into the room, filling it to the brim.
<Page13>
"Ah-----AAAHHH, AAAAAAA-------------"
As long as the temperature is not extremely high, a human body will not be killed instantly by fire. But this was a flame like a firearm that could reduce a human body to ashes with a single blow.
<Page14>
........It reminds me of how a flamethrower works.
It may look like it's shooting flames at you, but it's actually sending fuel flying to the target, literally "setting it on fire".
<Page15>
This flame is probably similar to that.
The whip of flame charred the area it touched as if it was melting it.
<Page16>
There was no way a human body could withstand such a thing that could easily pierce through tables and walls.
The only good thing about it was that it was so powerful that my upper body was instantly blown off and I was able to avoid the pain of being burned to death by the flames.

...... Let's stay in the room and see what happens.
As long as Arcueid can't move, it's not safe to go outside.
<Page2>
"..............."
...... Time is ticking away.
Grasping the knife with one hand, I stare at the monitor displaying nothing but flames.
<Page3>
Arcueid's eyes are closed.
Her appearance reminds me of her beauty, or rather, her strength from under the moonlight earlier.
More than half a day has passed since the incident in the alleyway.
Her 'power' should have returned a little by now.
<Page4>
.......
...................
.............................. It's hot.
It feels like I'm being smothered by a flame burning in front of me.
<Page5>
It was becoming difficult to breathe.
I decided that I would be safe as long as I was in this room, but at this rate, I would die before I could do anything.
<Page6>
"............"
...... Maybe I should have accepted the risk and have gone outside?
There's still time left.
I should go over my options carefully again and then...
<Page7>
The light goes out.
The mysterious high-temperature anomaly also came to an end.
At the same time,
I hear countless knocks on the door.
<Page8>
"Shiki, are you ready?"
With just a few words,
Arcueid mutters that from the midst of the darkness.
"......Ready, for what......?"
There was no reason for me to ask that.
<Page9>
--- If staying in this room was a mistake,
then was it also a mistake to ask such a question?
<Page10>
I heard the door being broken down and turned to look at it.
<Page11>
"----!"
A moment of hesitation,
as well as the fact that I stepped away from the door as a safety precaution,
has ultimately led to this being the 'result'.
<Page12>
It was two dogs that had broke down the door and entered.
They were flung away by Arcueid's claws immediately afterwards.
An unprecedented amount of fire was injected into the room, filling it to the brim without room to dodge.
<Page13>
"Ah-----aah, ah-------------"
A person cannot be killed instantly by fire as long as the temperature is not extremely high. But this was a flame like a blunt weapon that could reduce a human body to ashes with a single blow.
<Page14>
........ It reminds me of the mechanics of a flamethrower.
Although it looks like it's shooting flames, in reality, it is hurling fuel at its target, thus literally "setting it on fire".
<Page15>
This flame is probably similar to that.
The whip of flame charred the area it touched as if it was melting it.
<Page16>
There was no way a human body could withstand such a thing that could easily pierce through tables and walls.
The only good thing about it was that it was so powerful that my upper body was blown away in an instant, allowing me to avoid the pain of being burned to death by the flames.

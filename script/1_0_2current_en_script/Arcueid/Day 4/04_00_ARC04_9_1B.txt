"------"
I look down at what used to be a living thing.
I pull away the dog's jaw that had toppled over my arm with ease.
"-------Come on. It hardly bit my arm in the slightest."
<Page2>
I look at my bloody arm.
There are bite marks on my school uniform, but the gouged flesh is no more than a centimeter deep.
<Page3>
The majority of the blood belonged to the black dog that had its head pierced by me.
The pain of the bite at the time is minor, it's just that my fear was making the pain feel many times worse.
<Page4>
"------ Hah."
I lay down on the ground and look up at the ceiling.
My head hurts.
The world is full of splintered edges embedded with lines of death everywhere.
My hands and feet are completely cold, but my sense of reasoning is seething with a fever.
<Page5>
"--- Haha, ha."
Right next to me are the corpses of the two black dogs.
One arm is covered in blood while the other is holding a red knife.
...... In addition, there are countless human corpses laying around on the lower floors.
<Page6>
I couldn't help but laugh.
Because none of this was real.
There is no way any of this could be real.
And that's why I feel normal.
I'm completely normal without a shadow of a doubt.
The only thing that's crazy is this dream I'm having. As soon as I wake up, everything will go back to normal.

Ah, but--- How long have I been dreaming with my eyes wide open like this---?

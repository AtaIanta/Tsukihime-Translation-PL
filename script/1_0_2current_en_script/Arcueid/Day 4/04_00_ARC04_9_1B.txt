"――――――"
I look down at what used to be a living thing.
I remove the dog's jaw from my arm with ease.
"―――――――Wow. It hardly bit into it at all."
<Page2>
I look at my bloody arm.
There are bite marks on my school uniform, but the gouged flesh is no more than a centimeter deep.
<Page3>
The majority of the blood belongs to the black dog's head that I had pierced.
The bite is minor, but my fear is making the pain feel many times worse.
<Page4>
"――――――Hah"
I lay down on the ground and look up at the ceiling.
My head hurts.
The world is full of splintered edges embedded with lines of death everywhere.
My hands and feet are completely cold, but my sense of reasoning is seething.
<Page5>
"―――Haha, ha"
Right next to me are the corpses of the two black dogs.
One of my arms is covered in blood while the other is grasping a red knife.
...In addition, there are countless human corpses lying around on the lower floors.
<Page6>
I can't help but laugh.
Because none of this is real.
There's no way any of this could be real.
And that's why I feel normal.
I'm completely normal without a shadow of a doubt.
The only thing that's crazy is this dream I'm having. As soon as I wake up, everything will go back to normal.
<Page7>
Ah, but―――how long have I been dreaming with my eyes wide open like this―――?

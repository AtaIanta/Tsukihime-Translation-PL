"------"
I look down at what used to be a living thing.
I easily pulled away the dog's jaw that was entrapping me just now.
"-------What? It's not biting at all.
<Page2>
I look at my bloody arm.
There are bite marks on my school uniform, but the gouged flesh is no more than a centimeter deep.
<Page3>
A lot of that blood belongs to the black dog that got its head pierced by me.
The pain of the bite was minor, it was just that my fear was making the pain feel many times worse.
<Page4>
"------hah"
I lay on the ground and look up at the ceiling.
My head hurts.
The world is full of splintered edges embedded with lines of death everywhere.
ã€€My hands and feet are cold but my mind is seething with fever.
<Page5>
"---Haha, ha."
Nearby are the bodies of two black dogs.
One arm is covered in blood, the other is holding a red knife.
......And, countless human corpses are lying on the lower floors.
<Page6>
I can't help but laugh.
Because this is not real.
This can't be real.
Because I'm normal.
I'm perfectly normal.
It's this dream that's crazy. When I wake up, everything will be fine.

Ah, But----- How long have I been dreaming like this with my eyes open----?

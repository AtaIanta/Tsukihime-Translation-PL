"------"
I look down at what used to be alive.
The dog's jaw that covered my arm was easily pulled away.
"---Hey. It's not biting now."
<Page2>
I look at my bloody arm.
There are bite marks on my school uniform, but the gouged flesh is no more than a centimeter deep.
<Page3>
A lot of blood is from the black dog that I stabbed in the head.
The pain of the bite was insignificant, but my fear made the pain feel many times worse.

"-----,ha"
I lay on the ground and look up at the ceiling.
My head hurts.
The world is full of splintered edges, and I can see the lines of death here and there.
My hands and feet are cold, but my reason is seized by a fever.
<Page5>
"---Ha, ha."
Nearby are the bodies of two black dogs.
One arm is covered in blood, the other with a red knife.
...... and countless dead bodies are on the floor below.
<Page6>
I can't help but laugh.
Because this is not real.
This can't be real.
I'm normal.
I'm perfectly normal.
This is dream. Wake up and everything will be fine.

But... when did I start dreaming like this with my eyes open?

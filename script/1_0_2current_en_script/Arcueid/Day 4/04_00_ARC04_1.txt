......I wake up in the gray daylight.
I no longer hear the sound of raindrops.
The rain has stopped, but the sky still looks cloudy.
<Page2>
"Ha―――a"
I take a long breath and get up from the bed.
<Page3>
...... I couldn't sleep deeply last night.
Every time I kept falling asleep, I kept waking up with "that scene" replaying in my mind.
<Page4>
"......a bright red floor, with lying pieces......"
Reason and memory are inconvenient in these situations.
They try to remind you of all the things you want to forget that are inconvenient.
<Page5>
"......This is ridiculous. That was a dream, and I don't know how long I'm going to have nightmares about it."
<Page6>
...... Yes, it was just a dream.
Quick, forget about it as soon as possible.
<Page7>
A knock at the door.
The clock is just before six in the morning.
...... Who could it be this early?
<Page8>
"Excuse me―――
Shiki-sama？"
<Page9>
"I'm sorry. I see you are awake."
<Page10>
"No worries. I'm sorry for surprising you too. I was asleep last evening, so I woke up early.
......So, what's up with you, Hisui? What's going on with you this early?"
<Page11>
"..............."
Hisui fell silent as if confused.
Looking closely, I notice my school uniform in her hand.
<Page12>
"Did you bring me a change of clothes?"
"......Yes. I'm sorry again.
I'm sorry for the unpleasant situation I've made."
"?"
Hisui falls silent.
......I don't think there was anything unpleasant, but that is what it is.
<Page13>
"......Thanks for that. You can leave my uniform there. I'll be in the living room in a minute."
"Ok. Now if you excuse me."
<Page14>
Hisui heads for the door without a sound.
But.......
She pauses in front of the door and abruptly turns around.
<Page15>
"Shiki-sama. ......If you have time, I can prepare a bath for you."
"...... bath, in the morning?"
<Page16>
"Yes. You are very dirty. I think you should wash yourself off before going to school."
<Page17>
...She can tell that just by looking.
Yesterday, I was lying in the park yesterday with anemia, so I guess it's not surprising.
<Page18>
"Yeah, I'm sorry, can you prepare it?
I'm sure I can make it to school in time."
<Page19>
"Understood.
Please come to the bathhouse in about 20 minutes."
<Page20>
Hisui left the uniform and walked out of the room.
The time was still six in the morning.
I stared up at the ceiling of my room for twenty minutes without doing anything.
<Page21>
As I covered my head with water, my dulled thoughts finally cleared up.
I wet my hair in the cold water, taking a deep breath.
<Page22>
...... However, it was a disgusting dream.
It's crazy to dream about killing a woman you don't even know.
Even if I am exhausted from living in an unfamiliar mansion, if I'm having dreams like that, I can't imagine what the future holds.
<Page23>
"......That's right. I have to pull myself together."
I cover myself with cold water again and then wash myself.
"Ouch--"
The towel touched my throat and it throbbed.
<Page24>
"What is ......this?"
I look at my neck in the mirror.
......weird.
My throat is red and swollen.

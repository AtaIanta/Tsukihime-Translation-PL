......I wake up in the gray daylight.
I no longer hear the sound of raindrops.
The rain has stopped, but the sky still looks cloudy.
<Page2>
"Ha―――a"
I take a long breath and get up from the bed.
<Page3>
......I couldn't sleep properly last night.
Every time I tried falling asleep, I kept waking up with "that scene" replaying in my mind.
<Page4>
"......a bright red floor, with pieces scattered around......"
Reason and memory are inconvenient in these situations.
They try to remind you of all the things you want to forget.
<Page5>
"......This is ridiculous. That was a dream, and I don't know how long I'm going to have nightmares about it."
<Page6>
......Yes, it was just a dream.
Quick, forget about it as soon as possible.
<Page7>
A knock on the door.
The clock is just before six in the morning.
......who could it be this early?
<Page8>
"Excuse me―――#Shiki-sama？"
<Page9>
"I am sorry. I see you are awake."
<Page10>
"No worries. I'm sorry for surprising you too. I was asleep last evening, so I woke up early.
......So, what's up with you, Hisui? What's going on with you this early?"
<Page11>
"..............."
Hisui falls silent as if confused.
Looking closely, I notice my school uniform in her hand.
<Page12>
"Did you bring me a change of clothes?"
"......yes. I am sorry again.
I apologize for the unpleasant situation that I have created."
"?"
Hisui falls silent.
......I don't think there was anything unpleasant, but it is what it is.
<Page13>
"......thank you anyway. You can leave my uniform there. I'll be in the living room in a minute."
"Understood. Now if you will excuse me."
<Page14>
Hisui heads for the door without a sound.
But.......
She pauses in front of the door and abruptly turns around.
<Page15>
"Shiki-sama.......If you have time, I can prepare a bath for you."
"......bath, in the morning?"
<Page16>
"Yes. You are quite dirty. I suggest you wash yourself off before heading to school."
<Page17>
...She can tell that just by looking.
Yesterday, I was lying in the park with anemia, so I guess it's not surprising.
<Page18>
"Yeah, I'm sorry, can you prepare it?
I'm sure I can make it to school in time."
<Page19>
"Understood.
Please come to the bathhouse in about 20 minutes."
<Page20>
Hisui leaves the uniform and walks out of the room.
The time is still six in the morning.
I stare up at the ceiling of my room for twenty minutes without doing anything.
<Page21>
As I pour water on my head, my dull thoughts finally clear up.
I wet my hair in the cold water, taking a deep breath.
<Page22>
......however, it was a disgusting dream.
It's crazy to dream about killing a girl you don't even know.
Even if I'm exhausted from living in an unfamiliar mansion, if I'm having dreams like that, I can't imagine what the future holds.
<Page23>
"......that's right. I have to pull myself together."
I pour cold water on myself again and wash myself.
"Ouch--"
As the towel touches my throat, it throbs.
<Page24>
"What is......this?"
I look at my neck in the mirror.
......weird.
My throat is red and swollen.

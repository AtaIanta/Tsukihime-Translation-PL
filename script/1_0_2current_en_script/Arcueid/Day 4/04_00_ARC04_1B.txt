I went back to my room and changed into my uniform.
It was just after seven o'clock.
I took my bag and left the room, amazed that I recovered just by taking a bath.
<Page2>
"Good morning, Shiki-san. You're up early this morning#"
As I walked down the stairs, I saw Kohaku-san coming out of the living room.
<Page3>
"You are looking fresh.
Did you take the bath? "
"Yes, I took a bath just now. You are amazing, Kohaku-san. How did you notice that?"
<Page4>
"It's quite obvious. Shiki-san, your hair isn't completely dry.
After taking a bath, you look even more cute."
<Page5>
She gave me a carefree smile and I averted my gaze for no reason.
...... Now, my chest hurts when people smile at me.
<Page6>
"Please wait a moment.
I'm going to prepare breakfast now."
"Huh―――?"
......breakfast.
In other words, do you mean eating something?
<Page7>
This morning, I don't have an appetite.
The slightest words remind me of the colour of blood.
<Page8>
"So. Do you want a western style this morning?"
"......Ah, em. Basically, I don't mind either way.
I see, breakfast. The bath was so nice that I forgot about it."
<Page9>
"Is that so? You didn't eat last night either, so I was consulting with Hisui-chan if you woke up from the sound of your stomach."
<Page10>
"No, it's simply that I slept too much. I've always been a small eater, even as a kid, so it's common for me to skip a meal or two."
<Page11>
"Hahaha. If you ask me, you have a nice body with no flabby flesh. Are you a vegetarian by any chance?"
<Page12>
"I don't have that kind of obsession... but now that you mention it, I think at the Arima house I only ate vegetables."
<Page13>
After leaving the hospital, the doctor told me to avoid indigestible foods, but I feel that I have avoided eating meat regardless of that.
...It's probably because it reminds me of the death of a living creature.
<Page14>
"So you don't have any specific preferences.
If that's the case, I can prepare your meal without any worries. Please wait for me in the living room while I prepare your meal."
<Page15>
Kohaku-san turned on her heel to the living room, looking busy.
But I can't bring myself to swallow anything down my throat right now.
<Page16>
"...wait, Kohaku-san. I don't have much of an appetite today, so I'll just go to school. Tell Akiha I said so."
Then, I walked to the door.
But right after that, #someone grabbed my arm tightly.
<Page17>
"Shiki-san!"
......Unexpectedly
Kohaku-san seems angry.
<Page18>
"What are you talking about?
Shiki-san, didn't you look at the mirror this morning!?"
"...... I did, at the mirror in the bathroom......."
<Page19>
"You're lying. If you saw your face even once, you wouldn't say something like this!"
<Page20>
Looks like Kohaku-san is pretty angry.
......I remember when I saw my own face in the bathroom, it was beyond blue, a deathly pale colour.......
<Page21>
"But it's okay. I have less blood so I look paler than other people."
<Page22>
"No! You can't grow up without eating breakfast! If you don't have an appetite, I can make you a light meal, so please come to the dining room."
<Page23>
Kohaku-san grabbed my arm and forcefully started walking to the dining room.
...it can't be helped.
I seriously don't like this, but I'll take Kohaku-san's kind offer...
<Page24>
"Good morning, Nii-san.
How are you feeling?"
<Page25>
Akiha's greeting sounded more reserved than usual.
The lack of her usual bravado seemed to be a sign that she was worried about my health.
<Page26>
"Good morning. My body is doing reasonably well."
I returned the greeting and sat down on the chair.
"I'll prepare some easy to eat rice porridge for you.
Please wait a moment."
<Page27>
Kohaku-san moved quickly.
She went into the hallway and headed for the kitchen at the back of the West Wing.
There are three of us in the dining room - me, the uncharacteristically reserved Akiha, and Hisui, who is standing next to the wall.
<Page28>
"..............."
......it's kind of awkward.
"Nii-san、#Tell me about last night.
Is it true that you collapsed in the park?"
<Page29>
"Yeah. I can't quite remember it myself, but if Kohaku-san and Hisui say so, then it must be true, right?"
<Page30>
"Please do not talk about it as if it were someone else's problem.
You are physically weak, so if you feel like you are in any danger, please call the mansion. I'll send someone to pick you up right away."
<Page31>
"...... You know what? I'm not in elementary school, I don't need to do that. I can come home by myself no matter how bad I feel."
"Then you are still a child, because you could not come home alone yesterday."
<Page32>
"...... Yesterday was an exception. That kind of thing is rare.
I'm not weak, I'm just chronically anemic. I don't need you to worry about me every moment, Akiha.
I just experienced a near-fatal day yesterday, that's all."
<Page33>
"Do not be silly, do not call it fatal!
You are talking about your own body, aren't you!?　You just returned to the mansion, and if you die, what am I supposed to do......?"
"――――――"
Akiha is seriously pissed.
I was surprised to see that kind of anger with no room to spare.
<Page34>
"You are too careless.
Please take some more care of yourself"
<Page35>
"No. I'm not doing any club activities, and I'm following everything the doctor says. If you want me to take more care of myself, I guess I'll have to join a sanatorium or something."
<Page36>
"Yes, if I could, I would do that. 
We could also buy an isolated island somewhere and have you reflect on what you have done."
<Page37>
Akiha averted her gaze and casually made a scary remark.
What's scary is that Akiha isn't kidding about the current discussion.
<Page38>
"―――Hmph.
Okay, nothing happened this time, so I will drop the matter.
But there will not be a next time, Nii-san."
<Page39>
Akiha seems to have spoken her mind, and has put her <temper|tantrum> behind her.
Hisui is staring at our current exchange as if she were a statue.
<Page40>
"............"
......the silence is awkward.
It looks like we still have some time before we can eat, so I will---
C:>Ask about Akiha.
C:>Have a word about Kohaku-san.
C:>Ask about the mansion.

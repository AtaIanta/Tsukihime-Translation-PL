I return to my room and change into my uniform.
It has just turned seven o'clock.
I take my bag and leave the room, marveling at how restored I feel after simply having a bath.
<Page2>
"Good morning, Shiki-san. You are up early this morning#"
As I walk down the stairs, I see Kohaku-san coming out of the living room.
<Page3>
"You are looking somewhat refreshed.
Did you perhaps take a bath?"
"Yes, I took a bath just now. You're amazing, Kohaku-san. How did you notice that?"
<Page4>
"It's quite obvious. Shiki-san, your hair isn't completely dry.
After taking a bath, you look even cuter."
<Page5>
She gives me a carefree smile and I avert my gaze for no reason.
...Now, my chest hurts when people smile at me.
<Page6>
"Please wait a moment.
I am going to prepare breakfast now."
"Huh―――?"
...Breakfast.
In other words, I'm going to be eating something.
<Page7>
The slightest words remind me of the color of blood.
This morning, I have even less of an appetite than usual.
<Page8>
"Let's see. Do you want western style this morning?"
"...Ah, yeah. To be honest, I don't mind either way.
I see, breakfast. The bath was so nice that I forgot about it."
<Page9>
"Is that so? You did not eat last night either, so I was consulting with Hisui-chan if you woke up from the sound of your stomach."
<Page10>
"No, it's simply that I slept too much. I've always been a light eater even as a kid, so it's common for me to skip a meal or two."
<Page11>
"Ha hah. If you ask me, you have a nice body with no flabs whatsoever. Are you a vegetarian by any chance?"
<Page12>
"I'm not fussy about that sort of thing...though now that you mention it, I think I only ate vegetables at the Arima house."
<Page13>
After leaving the hospital, the doctor told me to avoid difficult to digest foods, but I feel that I have avoided eating meat regardless of that.
...It's probably because it reminds me of the death of a living creature.
<Page14>
"I see, so you don't have any specific preferences.
If that is the case, I can prepare your meal without any worries. Please wait for me in the living room while I prepare your meal."
<Page15>
Kohaku-san turns her back and heads to the living room looking busy.
But I can't bring myself to swallow anything down my throat right now.
<Page16>
"...Oh, no need, Kohaku-san. I don't have much of an appetite today, so I'll just go to school. Tell Akiha I said so."
With that, I walk to the door.
But immediately afterward, #someone grabs my arm tightly.
<Page17>
"Shiki-san!"
...That was unexpected.
Kohaku-san seems angry.
<Page18>
"What are you talking about?
Shiki-san, did you not you look at the mirror this morning!?"
"...Well, I did look at the mirror in the bathroom...."
<Page19>
"You are lying. If you saw your face even once, you would not say something like this!"
<Page20>
Looks like Kohaku-san is seriously angry.
...I remember when I saw my own face in the bathroom, it was beyond blue, a deathly pale color...
<Page21>
"But it's okay. I've always had a shortage of blood so I look paler than other people."
<Page22>
"No! You can't grow up without eating breakfast! If you don't have an appetite, I can make you a light meal, so please come to the dining room."
<Page23>
Kohaku-san grabs my arm and forcefully starts walking to the dining room.
...It can't be helped.
I'm seriously unenthusiastic about this, but I'll accept Kohaku-san's kind offer...
<Page24>
"Good morning, Nii-san.
How is your physical condition?"
<Page25>
Akiha's greeting sounds more reserved than usual.
The lack of her usual bravado seems to be a sign that she's worried about my health.
<Page26>
"Good morning. As for my body, well, it's in good condition, such as it is.
I return the greeting and sit down on the chair.
"Now then, I will prepare some easy-to-eat rice porridge for you.
Please wait a moment."
<Page27>
Kohaku-san moves quickly.
She goes into the hallway and heads for the kitchen at the back of the west wing.
There are three of us in the dining room - me, the uncharacteristically reserved Akiha, and Hisui, who is standing next to the wall.
<Page28>
"........"
...This is kind of awkward.
"Nii-san, #with regards to last night.
Is it true that you collapsed in the park?"
<Page29>
"Yeah. I can't quite remember it myself, but if Kohaku-san and Hisui say so, then it must be true, right?"
<Page30>
"Honestly, please do not talk about it as if it were someone else's problem.
You are physically weak, so if you feel like you are in any danger, please call the mansion. I'll send someone to pick you up right away."
<Page31>
"...You know what? I'm not in elementary school, I don't need to do that. I can come home by myself no matter how bad I feel."
"Then you are still a child. After all, you didn't come home by yourself yesterday."
<Page32>
"...Yesterday was an exception. That kind of thing is rare.
Besides, I'm just chronically anemic. That doesn't mean I'm weak. I don't need you to worry about me all the time.
I was just unfortunate to be in such critical condition yesterday, that's all."
<Page33>
"Oh, critical condition? Don't say such nonsense!
You are talking about your own body, are you not!? You just returned to the mansion, what am I supposed to do if you were to die...?"
"――――――"
Akiha is seriously ticked off.
I'm surprised to see that kind of anger with no room for argument.
<Page34>
"You are too careless.
Please take a bit more care of yourself."
<Page35>
"Well, I didn't do anything that unreasonable. I'm not doing any club activities and I'm following everything the doctor says. If you want me to take more care of myself, I guess I'll have to join a sanatorium or something."
<Page36>
"Yes, if I could, I would do that.
We could also buy an isolated island somewhere and have you reflect on what you have done there."
<Page37>
Akiha sullenly averts her gaze and casually makes a scary remark.
What's scary is that Akiha wasn't joking about what she just said.
<Page38>
"―――Sigh.
Fine. Nothing happened this time, so I will drop the matter.
But there will not be a next time, Nii-san."
<Page39>
Having spoken her mind, it appears that Akiha is finished with her outburst.
And as for Hisui, she is staring at our current exchange as if she were a statue.
<Page40>
"......"
...This silence is awkward.
It looks like we still have some time before we can eat, so I will---
C:>Ask about Akiha.
C:>Have a word about Kohaku-san.
C:>Ask about the mansion.

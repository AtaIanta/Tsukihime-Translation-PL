"Oh, by the way. I just remembered that you're still a student of Asagami Private Girl's Academy, isn't that right ......?"
"Yes. Because Asagami Private Girl's Academy is an escalator school."
<Page2>
Asagami Private Girl's Academy ia a school for young ladies in a neighboring prefecture.
The school was originally a missionary school founded in the early Meiji era, but now it is just a school that retains it's original name.
In the Showa era, the school was on the verge of closing due to financial difficulties, but was blessed with new supporters and is still in operation.
<Page3>
"It's a boarding school, right?
I was wondering why you commute from here."
"Asagami's uncle and father were close friends, so he was able to accommodate my needs.
He said he would allow me to go to school from home if there was a reason."
<Page4>
"No, that's not what I'm asking.
You were living in the dormitory until father passed away, right?ã€€Why do you go from the mansion now? Isn't it almost an hour's drive?"
<Page5>
"It's ----."
Stumbling over her words, Akiha averted her gaze.
<Page6>
"Shiki-sama. #Akiha-sama used to spend half of her week at the mansion. So it's not so special for her to go to the school from here."
"I didn't know that. But why would that be?"
<Page7>
"It was father's wish that we spend half the week here."
I understood.
Tohno Makihisa didn't allow Akiha any free time even when she was in middle school.
<Page8>
"......... I see. But he's dead now. You don't have to push yourself too hard, do you Akiha?
It's ridiculous to spend two hours traveling back and forth when you're so busy. It would be more fun to spend that time with your friends at the boarding house, right?"
<Page9>
"Yes, if I could do that, I would have no trouble.
But I have responsibilities. As long as incidents like yesterday happen, I'll be going to school from the mansion for the time being."
<Page10>
"Incidents like yesterday's ......?"
Was there a problem with the Tohno family's property while I was gone?
<Page11>
"If you're not aware of it, that's fine.
---More than that, Nii-san, you seem to know a lot about Asagami Academy, are you interested in it?
I'm sure it's a world that men don't have much contact with."
<Page12>
"Yeah. I know a little bit about it. Because that's the school attend."
"What?"
<Page13>
"I asked Keiko-san and she told me that when you became a junior high school student you were enrolled in Asagami Girl's Academy."
I just thought it wouldn't hurt to know what kind of school my sister went to.
<Page14>
"It's easy to find out info nowadays thanks to the Internet so I read a little about it. I haven't been there yet, though."
"Oh, I see. I'm sorry.
I was just thinking......."
<Page15>
Hmm. Due to the nature of Asagami Girl's Academy, there are many beautiful students and also many noble ladies.
It is also said that the "Relative Invitation Ticket", which allows non-students to enter the cultural festival, is worth its weight in gold.
That is all the information from Arihiko.

"I see. You're a good person, aren't you?
"......?"
<Page2>
I look up, surprised.
The woman is smiling.
Even though she said she is a vampire, she has a very honest face.
<Page3>
"I've decided.
You'll have to help me after all."
<Page4>
"......Wha..?"
She gives me a different, more meaningful smile than before.
Help ...... help her......?
<Page5>
"Hey. What do you mean, 'help'?"
"In exchange for your forgiveness,
I was wondering if you could help me get rid of the vampire that has taken root in this city.
"------"
...... No, I'm getting more confused.
<Page6>
"Wait,  what's the price of forgiveness? Is it really that easy to forgive?
In the first place, what do you mean to get rid of vampires, didn't you call yourself a vampire?
<Page7>
"Oh, no, no. I'm a vampire, but the vampire that has taken root in this city is something else.
You live in this city, right?
Then you must know about the recent murders."
<Page8>
"Uu......, well yeah..."
The familiar words cooled down my confused mind. It was strange, but the crazy story of the street murders was many times more real than the current situation.
<Page9>
"...... I know what that is. A serial killer, multiple murders, victims drained of blood..."
<Page10>
I understand the woman's argument by saying that much.
And that means that ......
<Page11>
"Yes. I'm talking about that vampire.
You keep telling me to kill you, but so far the only person I want to kill is him.
Isn't this murderer an enemy to you as well?"
<Page12>
"------"
I run my head to try and catch up with the updated situation.
I understand the context. I can understand what the woman is saying. But fundamentally, my common sense has been left behind.
<Page13>
"Really, humans are so inefficient, I don't understand it.
They say, `Vampires are doing this,' but no one is doing anything about it. It's like a squirrel that won't run away when the forest is on fire.
<Page14>
"No, I mean, there's no such thing as vampires, right?"
"Hm?."
The woman frowned sullenly.
...... That's right.
I remember that the person in front of me now is an unknown being who calls herself a vampire.
<Page15>
"'......, but what about it?
You're going to get rid of the vampire that's been killing people in this city?"
And now you're asking me to help you do it?
<Page16>
"Yeah. Anyway, my plans have fallen apart.
Yesterday, I was attacked and killed by a stranger. That was a real bummer. It was a perfect surprise attack, and I was cut into seventeen pieces before I could even try to fight back.
<Page17>
"How about following someone you've just seen for the first time, killing them, and then leaving, satisfied? Really, it's beyond horrible. That guy is a full-blown murderer with no excuse."
<Page18>
"Ugh----"
...... Damn. That murderer is me, for all intents and purposes.
I'd like to deny it, but I have almost no way to deny it.
<Page19>
"I really thought I was going to die before I restored my body.
I've never been humiliated like that before, and it took more than 80% of my strength to restore myself.
<Page20>
"But more than that, it really, really hurt. It hurt so much that I almost lost my mind, but then it hurt again so much that I came back to my senses.
Do you know how I felt after spending one night in such repetition?
<Page21>
"..............."
I'm sorry. As a human being, this is beyond anything I can imagine.
<Page22>
"And I hated you so much I looked for you.
I hated you so much that I even neglected my goal, which was to find that vampire."
<Page23>
"It was only a couple of hours ago that I found out from the land records that your clothes belonged to that school.
I was going to wait until nightfall to catch you, but I didn't want to wait another minute. So I decided to wait over there."
<Page24>
"..............."
.....So that's why she was waiting for me in front of the school.
I'm sure that after experiencing that much pain, she must have been dying to kill me.
But ......
<Page25>
"I don't understand ....... If you hated me so much, how can you say you forgive me?"
<Page26>
"........You're right.
Well, In short, the time has passed and I've cooled down.
I've used up a lot of my power, and I figured it would be more efficient to let you become a soggy shield instead of killing you.
<Page27>
"...... Hey. Didn't you just say something awful?
"What? What did I say?"
"You said something about using people as shields."
Also, you added some scary sound effects.
<Page28>
"What? Isn't that obvious.
I forgave you, but that was only because I had to deal with my own personal feelings.
The act of murder that you committed must be atoned for by your actions, not your feelings, right?"
"...I mean that's true...but....."
<Page29>
I knew I was going to be killed for revenge, but that's not the same thing as being a shield.
I'm not sure what the difference is, but I have a bad feeling about it anyway.
<Page30>
"I don't know if you're being honest or just being mean.
I repeat, I was killed by you.
You can't imagine, but it takes a lot of strength to come back from death."
<Page31>
"It wouldn't have mattered if you'd merely killed me.
But your cuts were like no cuts I've ever seen, and the wounds wouldn't connect, so I had to rebuild my body.
As a result, I had to use most of my strength to come back to life!"
<Page32>
The woman was so angry that she was pouting.
She had forgotten about it until now, but now that she had explained it, she remembered her anger from last night.
<Page33>
"Anyway, I'm weak now.
I'm sure I'll recover in a couple of nights, but if I'm attacked before then, there's nothing I can do. #So I'm going to need you to be my shield in the meantime."
"No, just because I get it doesn't mean you get to decide everything!"
<Page34>
"It's your fault that I'm in this situation, so you should at least do that, right?
Or are you saying that you have no remorse?"
<Page35>
The woman stares at me with straight eyes.
"..............."
<Page36>
That's not fair.
Before I say I'm sorry or I deserve it, I don't want you to look at me like that.
If you call yourself a monster like a vampire, please don't look at me with such pure eyes as if blaming me.
<Page37>
"...........you...."
I bite down on my feelings of compassion.
I feel remorse, I seek atonement.
But my heart is telling me that it is wrong to cooperate with this person as a human being.

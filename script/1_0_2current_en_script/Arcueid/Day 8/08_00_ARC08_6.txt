<Page1>
I suppose it was due to the murders on the streets.
So far, I hadn't passed anyone, and the park was completely empty.
<Page2>
There, a silhouette of a white woman standing alone.
<Page3>
"Shiki!"
"!?"
Nonetheless, as soon as she saw my face, Arcueid yelled at me.
<Page4>
"Hey, what's up? Did I get the time wrong, or what?"
"Yes!　What time do you think it is?
It's ten minutes past the promised time!"
<Page5>
...10 minutes late... Well, because I left the mansion just before 10:00, even if I ran as fast as I could, I wouldn't be able to arrive on time.
Meanwhile, Alcade seemed to have arrived punctually.
<Page6>
"Oh, I'm sorry. I was hoping to make it at ten, but it took me longer than I thought to sneak out.
If only you had a phone..."
<Page7>
I could have at least contacted her, but I feel like it's insane to communicate with a vampire via email.
<Page8>
"No, it's nothing.
I'll be punctual next time. Just give me a pass this time."
<Page9>
"---Jeez. I'm going to start killing a bunch of people, but you don't seem to be aware of it at all, do you?"
<Page10>
Arcueid was in such a bad mood that it seems she is fuming.
"............"
Could it be that she was waiting for me before the appointment?
<Page11>
".......Hey. Arcueid, how long have you been waiting here?"
"Me?　I came here as soon as I woke up, so, uh----"
<Page12>
"I got here around seven, I think."
"Seven o'clock, so you've been waiting for over three hours?"
No way, why did you come three hours before the appointed time in the first place?
<Page13>
"Yes. Something's wrong with me.
Arcueid was talking to herself, as if she was confused.
<Page14>
"......Well, it's my fault for being late, but you have your own problems too.
I don't like it when people show up before the appointment and then wait for me."
<Page15>
"Mmm. It's a different matter. The fact that you are late doesn't change the issue."
<Page16>
"...... That's right, I know.
But why did you wait for three hours? Even if you came by mistake, you could have gone back to your room for that time."
<Page17>
"I don't know about that either.
I just thought waiting for you, Shiki, was fun, and before I knew it, it was ten o'clock."
"Why are you saying it was fun?"
<Page18>
"Come on. I told you that I don't know either.
I don't know if it's because I was killed by you...... I feel like something in my body is broken and hasn't healed.
I think I'm crazy, but I can't figure out what's wrong with my body and why."
<Page19>
"............"
I'm not sure how to respond to that.
After dismantling the Alcade into seventeen pieces, and hearing there is something wrong with her body, I have no other choice but to apologize.
<Page20>
"Mmm, okay. #Time is running out, and we don't have time to waste talking.
"Yeah. Thanks a lot for saying that."
<Page21>
"But if you're late again, I'll pick you up directly from your house. You're the one who can't keep a promise, so you have nothing to complain about, do you understand?"
<Page22>
"No--- you can't do that!　I'll keep my promise. Of course, I'll keep it.
But unforeseen situations happen all the time, right?　Being late is one of them!
Why don't you just never come to my house again!　I'm still being misunderstood by Akiha, and if I'm pushed around any further, she might seriously turn my room into a kennel!"
<Page23>
"Hmmm...... Akiha, you mean the sister who doesn't look like you at all?"
".......It's unnecessary to say that she doesn't look like me, but I talk about her."
<Page24>
"I see. Are you really that afraid of your sister, Shiki?"
"You know what? My sister scared the hell out of---"
I almost said, "my brother," and I swallowed the words.
I'm not afraid of her, but somehow, I'm not very familiar with Akiba.
<Page25>
"I simply don't want my sister to worry about extra things.
......I've been bothering her for a long time. I just want her to stay in the dark as long as possible."
"I see. You are kind to your sister, Shiki."
<Page26>
"Basically, I'm nice to everybody.
Only recently I've made an exception."
"Haha, that's me."
<Page27>
"......, you know, I was being sarcastic.
I wasn't complimenting, I was insulting you."
<Page28>
"Is that so?　But I'm an exceptional person to you, right?　I don't mind that kind of thing."
Arcueid is still laughing.
And smiling carefreely like a child.
<Page29>
"............"
It seems that the temperature of my body has risen.
I exaggeratedly averted my gaze because I felt that if I look at her any longer, the poison might be released.
<Page30>
"Let's get down to business, Arcueid.
We're going to do the same vampire hunt as yesterday, right?"
"Oh, yes, of course. You don't have to take off your glasses for long tonight, just follow me."
<Page31>
We are strolling through the city at night.
Arcueid has a specific destination in mind, but without knowing the details, it's like the two of us are wandering around.
<Page32>
"Tonight I need you to pinpoint it for me. Let's start with the noisy ones."
Saying this, Arcueid turned to go to the downtown area in front of the station.
<Page33>
Nocturnal castle that never sleeps past ten o'clock.
Exposition of civilization with various sounds and lights.
Fashionable places that change in a matter of months.
White vampires pass by, looking the same for centuries.
<Page34>
...... No, centuries might be an exaggeration.
I've heard that vampires are immortal and live a long life, so the word just sort of came to me.
<Page35>
"Shiki, look at that building. It's six floors tall and narrow. Do you see any lines on the people going in?"
"......It's normal. No dead people in or out."
"No luck. Let's move on. Put on your glasses. We have a long way to go, so take it easy."
<Page36>
As she had said during the day, Arcueid identified several places where the dead were cruising.
There were six of them.
The first two were wrong, but the third, a rental building, was right on the spot.
<Page37>
The security guards coming in and out of one of the vacant tenant rooms were a dead set of lines.
Arcueid, judging things by my expression, left me in the hallway, went into the room, and came out a minute later without a problem.
<Page38>
"I'm sorry, this place is also a bust. It was a low-grade ghoul. I hunted all over this area yesterday, so they were fully alerted."
Disappointment was faintly visible in Arcueid, who shrugged her shoulders in despair.
<Page39>
"What's with the smirk? Are you enjoying my failure?"
"No, I'm not. No, no, no. I'm just trying to understand why you, who's always so easygoing, can be so discouraged."
<Page40>
"Mmm. What do you mean? I break and destroy things as much as anybody else."
I wanted her to say, "I suffer and grieve as much as anyone else," but I knew that would be an absurd order for her, so I kept my mouth shut.
<Page41>
We sneaked out of the rental building and went to our next destination.
The time was almost midnight.
<Page42>
As expected, the number of pedestrians decreased and the neon lights also diminished.
The taillights of cars drift by.
Arcueid takes her steps to match the light.
<Page43>
After the fifth hiccup, we are heading for our final destination.
The destination seems to be a residential area.
Arcueid didn't speak, but I could somehow sense that it was the main destination for tonight.
<Page44>
"...Though, I know that, but it's still frustrating.
It's so prehistoric that we have to do research on our feet.」
"Exterminating vampires has always been a hassle. Finding a coffin somewhere in the city isn't easy."
<Page45>
" I see, that's fine... I'm not saying I don't like it.　It's just that I thought it would be tough for you too, Alcade!"
"Hmm?　It's not hard for me, you know?　It's a fixed task, and if you follow the steps, you can accomplish it successfully."
<Page46>
"Right." I replied blankly.
When it comes to exterminating vampires, Arcueid is absolutely methodical. No matter how mundane the task, if it's a step that leads to the goal, she's going to make sure it's done with a steady and cold approach.
<Page47>
Just because she can jump 10 meters in the air doesn't mean that everything she does is insane.
<Page48>
......When I think about it, it was the same when I first met her.
She was looking for a vampire in the crowd, so as not to disturb human society. Even I could have done the same with Vlov if I wanted to.
<Page49>
"......what's with the staring at people's faces?
If you don't look forward properly, you'll fall."
<Page50>
"......Yeah. This is a pretty strange thing, isn't it?
Hey. Are you okay with being with me, Shiki?　Aren't you afraid of killing vampires or something?"
<Page51>
"What?"
I couldn't help but raise my voice at the abrupt and rather sudden question.
Am I okay with being with Arcueid?
I don't need to think about that.
<Page52>
"I don't mind. I don't know if I'm okay or not.
We're a partnership of mutual interests. I'm scared of vampires, but I'll put up with them for the good of the city."
<Page53>
Hmmm, Arcueid seems satisfied.
That is where the conversation ended.
We walk in silence down the sidewalk, with no one passing us.
<Page54>
We had come a long way from the station. In the past two hours, there were almost no results, but strangely, I didn't feel exhausted.
Although we haven't come close to solving the problem, we have certainly prevented the situation from getting worse.
I guess that's what makes me feel fulfilled.
"But it's nice to not have to worry about it."
She revealed her feelings, something she had never said before.
<Page55>
"Shiki?"
"I'm an asshole at heart, you know. I'm a total jerk, so having a good person like you around makes me feel safe."
---From the bottom of my heart, I can feel relieved.
<Page56>
My vision is broken.
My perception of Tohno Shiki is corrupted.
I am not supposed to be here.
......I think my conclusions, which I've known for seven years, will fade in front of her.
<Page57>
"Hey, hey.
Does that mean I'm making it fun for you?"
"The opposite. You are one of scary vampires. The only thing that makes me feel better is that no matter how things turn out, they won't be any worse than they are now."
<Page58>
"Mmm. Which part is 'scary'?"
<Page59>
"There are many parts. There's the part where I kill you, and you come back to life and keep chasing me,# or the part where you can get away with a 3000 degrees temperature,# or the part where you use duct tape, #or the part where you run up to the top of a building, or the part where you wreck the station.
......or the part where you did everything you could to prevent a freezing storm of Vlov.
<Page60>
"The part about churning up the bedrock, the part about painting people's bodies with something I don't understand, and the part about coming to school during the day."
<Page61>
"Yes, that's enough, I understand your feelings very well!"
"Hmm?　Are you sure? I still have a few more things to say."
<Page62>
"Okay, I understand.
I know I'm a vampire anyway!"
<Page63>
Arcueid speeds up and moves quickly ahead.
"Wait a minute!
I can't catch up with you if you start getting serious!"
<Page64>
I ran after the white back.
The sixth destination was already within a stone's throw.

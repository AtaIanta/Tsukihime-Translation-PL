At that time, the mansion was a big playground.
A forest like a deep sea.
A house like a tall castle.
A garden that would take days to explore.
We played around there.
<Page2>
Every day was fun.
I had no idea that one day I was going to grow up.
Morning and night repeated themselves in the same way.
I never doubted it.
That was my childhood, frolicking like a puppy.
We played well together and were great friends.
<Page3>
Whenever I turned around, Akiha was there.
Whenever I waved my hand, she would hide in embarrassment.
Yeah, that was the way it always was.
<Page4>
At that time, the mansion was a big playground.
A forest like a deep sea.
A house like a high castle.
It was a closed world that took days to explore.
We played around.
<Page5>
I wake up slowly.
The morning light peels away the sleep that had been sticking to me.
In the meantime.
I have the feeling that I had a nostalgic dream.
<Page6>
"......"
As soon as I woke up, something disgusting came into my sight.
<Page7>
A sharp headache that gouged the flesh and bones of my temples.
This morning is so vivid, it's as if the sun has fallen into my room.
The strong sun is staining the room all around.
<Page8>
"Ha.......oh."
My glasses. I strained my arm to reach for the glasses on my pillow, but the response was minimal.
I couldn't feel my limbs. I can't send orders properly. The mind seemed to be the only part of my body that was working properly.
<Page9>
"――――――"
I couldn't even close my eye lids, I just ate up the time.
<Page10>
The strong light softens.
I recall the feeling in my limbs.
Taking a deep breath, I finally put on my glasses to the sight.
<Page11>
"A―――――hh."
I exhaled and finally lifted myself out of bed.
<Page12>
Nothing to worry about.
Symptoms I have now are what I used to have when I was in the hospital.
Temporary loss of vision due to exhaustion, numbness in the limbs. In addition, there was a loss of appetite.
If I look at things with my bare eyes too much, this is bound to happen.
<Page13>
"But now..."
I can feel that I can see more clearly than before.
Lines on buildings are difficult to see. Even when I could see them, they were thin and rarely as clear as they are now.
The lingering headache in my temples is like a gunshot wound.
<Page14>
The Sensei said.
My eyes may bring bad things.
Arcueid told me not to use my eyes too much.
She said... It's an act that destroys the brain.
<Page15>
".................."
This is the price of being involved with vampires in human form.
Instead of taking risk only when facing vampires, I always take risk.
<Page16>
...... No need to check now. With that in mind, I chose to help Arcueid.
<Page17>
"......That' s right. It's not that big of a deal."
<Page18>
Mostly, turning away won't change the fact that we're in the middle of a whirlpool.
The vampires must be wiped out from the city.
For the safety of Akiha and those close to me, I have no choice but to lend a hand to Arcueid.
<Page19>
" All right."
With a change of mind, I get up from the bed with energy.
I quickly change my clothes and thank Hisui for last night.
<Page20>
"Huh――――?"
Speaking of which, there's no sign of Hisui.
It is past seven in the morning.
It's usually the time when Hisui is waiting for me and calls me to wake up.
<Page21>
"......I guess you overslept, Hisui."
However, there is a neatly prepared change of uniform on the desk.
<Page22>
Maybe she has some other work to do.
I was curious, but it is something I have nothing to do with.
I didn't have much time this morning, so I quickly change into my uniform and go downstairs.

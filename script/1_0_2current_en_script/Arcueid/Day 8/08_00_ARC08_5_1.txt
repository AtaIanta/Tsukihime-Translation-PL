...... Let's be honest.
I can't hide it from Hisui and Kohaku-san, who are in charge of the house, no matter how much I try to fool them.
Then I'll at least tell them that I'll be away for the night.
<Page2>
"...... Oh. Actually, I'm going to be out for the next few nights.
But I swear, I'm not playing any bad games. I know Akiha will hate me for it, but I can't let it stop me."
<Page3>
...... That's right.
If there is an unknown vampire, and several people are sacrificed, and Arcueid is the only one who can stop it.
As a person who lives in this city, I can't pretend that I didn't see it.
<Page4>
"I know this is going to bother you, Hisui, but it would be nice if you could overlook it for a while. I'll be back at midnight, so just leave the front door unlocked for me."
<Page5>
"You say you cannot tell us, is there a reason?"
"...That's right. I'm sorry, Hisui. I'm just being a slacker and I don't want you to hear anything right now."
<Page6>
"......No. Shiki-sama, you are my master.
No servant would disparage his master as a sloppy person."
<Page7>
With no expression on her face, Hisui spoke plainly.
Then the conversation ceased.
I bowed my head to Hisui and walked up the stairs to the lobby.
<Page8>
"Please wait.#"
.......
From behind me, Hisui stopped me with the calmest voice I've ever heard.
<Page9>
"...... I'm sorry to bother you with this, but..."
Hisui cut off her words once, then clasped her hands together and looked at me.
<Page10>
"As long as you are willing, I can conceal the fact that you go out at night from Akiha-sama."
"... Is that what you mean...?"
<Page11>
"Yes. It's not uncommon for Akiha-sama to leave her room after dinner. My sister and I make the rounds before bedtime, so if we fail to report it, no one will know what's going on in Shiki-sama's room."
<Page12>
"That's great. No, that's helpful, but is it...... okay?
Akiha is the employer of both of you."
"I thought I told you that you are my master."
<Page13>
.......I'm not sure I can help it.
I told her to stop calling me "sama", and now I am furiously thanking her.
Hisui, in her own way, listened to my lame argument and said she would help me.
<Page14>
"Thank you, Hisui. That would be a great help."
"Then please use this card key from tonight.
Akiha-sama told me to change the password of the main gate of the mansion.
If you use this key card, you can unlock the main gate even in the middle of the night."
<Page15>
"Wow, that's Akiha for you, she is quick to react......"
It was a close...... If I had gone out without knowing this, I might have ended up spending the night in front of the main gate on my way back.
<Page16>
"That is all I have to say.
I will not stop you from going out at night, but please be careful and do not get hurt."
With that, Hisui bowed and left.
<Page17>
"――――― I did it."
A helping hand unexpectedly came to the rescue.
I'll be able to get out of the mansion without worrying about Akiha in the future.
<Page18>
After dinner alone, I went back to my room.
It was almost ten o'clock in the evening.
"Okay... let's go."
I tucked the knife into my pocket and left the room, making as little noise as possible.

There is no excuse for what happened last night.

"To apologize is to admit that you were wrong.
In that case, I will have to punish the eldest son of the Tohno family accordingly, right?"
It was a smile full of lechery that could have been misheard as "wouldn't you want to have it?".

But the crisp voice of Akiha stopped me in my tracks.

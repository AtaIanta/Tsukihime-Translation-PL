When I returned to the classroom after lunch, I found Arihiko there.
He hadn't been there in the morning, so it seemed he had simply come for lunch.
<Page2>
"Oh, Tohno, good mornin'."
"......"
The boss is on the clock.
Had the whole school known about Arcueid, I'm sure I would have had a dispute with this guy.
I'm really glad that Arcueid went home quietly.
<Page3>
"Gee. What's with those chilly eyes?"
Can ya please stop looking at people like, "Poor thing, but if they take out the autograph coupons, it's a CD that sells for 10 yen a piece"."
<Page4>
"Well, I'm sorry. I've been in a bit of a tizzy and I was tired, so I couldn't hide my true feelings. I'll be careful next time."
"Seriously? But, what you should be hiding is what you just said, right?"
<Page5>
While saying this, instead of heading for his seat, Arihiko was gingerly looking towards the rear doorway of the classroom.
He seemed to be seriously planning to leave now after finishing his lunch.
<Page6>
"Well, I'm off to save the world for a bit with a bunch of fellas over the net.#"
Arihiko hurriedly left the classroom.
<Page7>
And then, on his back.
"Hey. You said before that the area in front of the north exit is dangerous, but where are the other dangerous places?"
Somehow, he asked me that question.
<Page8>
"What's with the suddenness?# There aren't many spots that are as bad as the North Exit Department Store....... If I had to guess, I'd say that one. It's the abandoned hospital of Kushigata. It was a meeting place for the <biker gans|Yankees> until two years ago, but now no one can find them anymore."
<Page9>
"Kushigata is two stops away? But it's not surprising that an abandoned building is noisy, no one would normally follow it."
<Page10>
"No, so... That's why, you know, nobody's around anymore. One day, all the Yankees disappeared. Nearly thirty people have been reported missing, and there are still search reports.
Well, this is a ghost story, not a violent incident like the one at the north exit. Nowadays, it's like a bad debt for the government, where no vagrant can settle down."

The homeroom meeting for deciding the program for next month's cultural festival was unexpectedly difficult.
Various opinions flew around, and as a result of the conflicting opinions of the boys and girls, the decision was postponed until next week.
<Page12>
After-school club activities are prohibited.
All students leave school promptly.
<Page13>
"---- Well."
There was no point in dawdling in the classroom.
After this, let's go to...
C:>Abandoned hospital.
C:>the mansion.

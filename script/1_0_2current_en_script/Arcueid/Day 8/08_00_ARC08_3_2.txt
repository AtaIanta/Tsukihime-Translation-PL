<Page1>
Suddenly, I became calm.
I am a person who can separate what I can and cannot do.
<Page2>
When faced with the stormy waves of fate, what can a tiny human do alone?
Yes, there is nothing to do but pray, and let things happen as they may.
<Page3>
"Come to think of it, I've always been a big fan of the Modern Society."
Let's concentrate on the class without looking aside.
I'm going to concentrate on the class, and I'm going to talk about the global environmental issues that have arisen since the beginning of the 2000s.
<Page4>
".................."
I see, the earth's resources are too much for the current human race to use up, but that and the changes in the earth's surface due to environmental destruction are two different issues. Human beings can't destroy this planet no matter how much they try. However, because of our own mischief, the temperature and ecosystem will change, and the hurdles for human survival will increase. #If I leave my room in a mess, I won't be able to live in my room, but the house itself won't change, and the only one who will be punished is me, who will be kicked out of my room and have no place to stay. Yeah, it's a natural thing.
<Page5>
By the way.
I'm trying my best to concentrate on the class, but what's with the chill that's been building up since a while ago?
<Page6>
"Oh yeah, this is the place!
I had a hard time finding all the rooms that looked the same!"
<Page7>
Ahaha. I... don't know what sort of embarrassed... laugh I'm making, but the suspicious person is moving quickly to the podium.
<Page8>
"What's wrong with you? I'm in class."
The modern society teacher, Mamiya, was puzzled, but scolded the suspicious person. That's what I'm talking about. He's not just the oldest teacher in our school. He's an excellent teacher.
However.
<Page9>
"I've been waiting for you. Here are the materials for today."
Mamiya simply handed the textbook to the suspicious person and left the classroom.
<Page10>
A buzzing classroom. The <students|classmates>, surprised by the suddenness of the situation, operate their mobile terminals at high speed and start chatting with each other.
<Page11>
『Sorry, can someone explain this to me?』
『Mamiya left, but is this okay?』
『I don't know. Do I know you? You look good.』
『I seek opinions from experts.』
『Oh my God, she's so close, she's so beautiful!』
『This school is going through too many changes, like Noel-sensei.』
『I thank God that I'm in front of a blackboard.』
『Only terrorists go to classes.』
<Page12>
"Everyone......"
How far are you from danger awareness?
<Page13>
"Nice to meet you, I'm Albi, your special teacher!
Thank you all for coming for me today!"
No, this isn't a matter of danger awareness, right?
<Page14>
I slid back the chair back by one body length.
I slide off the chair so that it falls to the floor.
I continue moving toward the exit at the back of the classroom.
<Page15>
Everyone in the classroom was too preoccupied with the special teacher, Albi, standing on the podium to notice my escape.
No doubt about it. The teacher Mamiya and this situation, the Mystic Eyes are being misused.
<Page16>
"'Well, I should just write stuff on the blackboard, right?
Modern Society......?　Oh, social studies!　So let's start a special vampire lecture..."
<Page17>
Oh, wait, I want to hear that.
No, but that's exactly what the enemy wants.
Ten minutes left until lunch break.
"Aaah! Shiki's gone!
You ran away, you bastard---!"
I tried to remain calm and ran to the place where I needed to go now.
<Page18>
I move to the back of the gym where there is no one around.
Here, I won't catch the attention of other students.
The rest can be done at ......
<Page19>
"Hey!
I've come all this way to see you, but you're running away!
Don't you think you should have the guts to take any pinch head on!?"
<Page20>
As described above, if the vandals are caught by the bait and chase after you, you will have escaped your predicament.
<Page21>
"No. If I sense danger, I run."
It depends on the type of pinch, but I keep my mouth shut there.
<Page22>
"That's not the point!
Arcueid-sensei, I'm the one who should be angry.
You said you don't want to be a part of human society, right?
Didn't you say you would avoid being conspicuous?"
<Page23>
"But what the hell was that?
I'm not sure if you're serious about killing vampires anymore."
<Page24>
"What? Of course I'm serious, you idiot!
Besides, I was wearing a proper disguise!　I'm not trying to stand out!"
<Page25>
"Disguise ...... no way ...... are those glasses ......?"
Are you a truly terrifying monster?
<Page26>
"Yes, that's right!
I spent yesterday studying to see if I could understand Shiki's feelings!
School is for teachers, and teachers wear glasses, don't they?
I don't know why you wear them at all, but do they look good on me?"
<Page27>
"---m, guh ......"
In a voice that bounces from the bottom of my heart, Albi-sensei shows me her glasses.
<Page28>
......Damn, what a vampire...... It's not fair...... I was ready to scold her just a moment ago, but when she looks at me like that, I lose steam...
<Page29>
"Oh my God, I understand, I understand!
If you want to talk to me, I'll listen to you, but no more Albi-sensei, and I'll confiscate your glasses!"
<Page30>
"Oh."
I took the dangerous product from Arcueid.
It's hard to compete when she is wearing glasses.
This is a forbidden move and must be banned.
<Page31>
"...... I made it, but Shiki took it away."
"Don't make it sound like it's my fault. At school, they confiscate hazardous materials."
"......didn't I look pretty......?"
<Page32>
"------"
I gasped at the vulnerability that was so out of character for Arcueid.
<Page33>
......I'm even more distracted than usual.
It's daytime, so she's not so energetic, I don't know if I'm bothered by that kind of Arcueid because it's fresh, or if I'm bothered by the fact that, in the first place, no matter what this cretin does, in the end--

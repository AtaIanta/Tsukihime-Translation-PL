 We face each other as enemies.
 I won't get defensive, instead greeting Noel with my current posture.
<Page2>
 After all, the reach of the weapons are different.
 The moment I take a stance, Noel will be happy to swing her spear at me.
<Page3>
"Oh, you're not going to run or get ready?
 I see. You're too scared to move♡
 Yes, yes, a pretty boy in the humanities should be like that!
 Even though you spend every night with vampires, you're so cute☆"
<Page4>
 Two steps. Three steps. Four steps. #―――one more step.
 My weapon is too short, and I'm helpless.
 There's no leeway for me.
 From the woman that has plenty,
<Page5>
"As I thought―――seems like you only dealt with helpless humans after all!"
 Just like this.
 Her attacking my right side and tearing my arm off, it's not hard to imagine.
<Page6>
 A mass of steel passes right over my head.
"Fue, you fell over―――!?"
 I fall forward to the ground, dodging a lashing swipe eighty centimeters up.
<Page7>
 My entire body falls toward the ground, but before I fall fully, I regain my stance and carry my body in front of the woman.
<Page8>
"Wha, no―――"
 I bring my left hand around the woman's waist. We're close together, like a ballroom dance.
 My right hand, grasping the knife, is around the back of the woman's neck.
<Page9>
 The kill is a breath away.
<Page10>
 But, before that.
 A thought entered my mind that I should think about "whose enemy" this woman really was.
<Page11>
"Don't... bite me!"
 The woman lets go of her spear and grabs my right hand behind her neck, kicking my legs out at the same time.
 A perfect sweeping leg throw, in Judo terms.
<Page12>
"Gu, ah...!"
 I slam back down to the ground.
 The reason for this is different from the earlier fall.
 Even in such a short fall, a human body can easily be destroyed when thrown with such strength.
<Page13>
"Sorry... but that was a really nice turnaround!
 It's just an imitation, but it was really cool!"
<Page14>
 Noel picks up the spear, cheering herself on.
 With a deliberate cough, as I collapse to the ground, she stomps on my chest with her boot.
<Page15>
"Ugh..."
"W, well, that was pretty good for a fluke.
 It wasn't cool when you tried to run away and fell down, though."
<Page16>
 Fufu, Noel laughs triumphantly and puts strength into her boots.
 I'm not completely pinned, but the hostility and murderous intent towards me seems to be real.
<Page17>
"...Could it be that you're a vampire too?"
 I'll check just in case.
<Page18>
"You're five seconds away from being crushed, but that's what you say?
 I can't even tell if you're being serious right now.
 What, Even a kid is trying to trick me? This teacher doesn't like that impertinent attitude, she hates it!" //Double check this line
<Page19>
"Ouch...!"
 She steps away with an exaggerated motion, but it was only for show and the pressure on my chest was not strong.
<Page20>
 That reaction just now... As I figured, she's human. She hates the fact that she was treated like a vampire.
 That being the case, why not conveniently return to being a teacher?

"Ha, it's no use―――!"
<Page2>
"Tch―――!"
 The moment I take my stance, Noel kicks off the ground.
 The distance between our weapons is too great.
 Before I can react, I'm struck sideways by the handle of the spear.
<Page3>
"Ugh...!"
 I'm dazzled by the tremendous impact.
 I feel like my body was blown almost a meter.
<Page4>
 I fight through the pain to catch myself.
 I roll onto my back on the asphalt and managed to lessen the impact, but Noel's figure is already in front of me.
<Page5>
"That's no good, Shiki-kun. Being so defensive when facing an enemy, it's so sweet that I can't help smiling.
 I was a little nervous, so I really hammered you there. Are you still alive?"
<Page6>
"Ah... ha."
 As I try to sit up,
"Guh...!?"
 Noel's heavy boots stomp down on my chest.
<Page7>
"Yep, you should be quiet. We're not lovers, so I don't owe you anything, okay? If you get out of line, I'll crush your neck with my own hands♡"
"Tch―――"
<Page8>
 I collapse and stare at Noel.
 I can't grasp the situation at all.
 Even so, it's clear that this woman's killing spirit was real, and that she wanted to kill me.
<Page9>
"Shit, you're a vampire too!"
"―――What did you say?"
 You said, I'm a vampire? Why would you call me one of those monsters?"
<Page10>
"Agh...!"
 The pressure on my chest increases.
 That reaction just now... Was she really that angry about being called a vampire...?

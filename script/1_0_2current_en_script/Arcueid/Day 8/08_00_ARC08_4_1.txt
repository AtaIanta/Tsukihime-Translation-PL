"......Kushigata Hospital......"
Although not inspired by Arcueid, it would not be a waste of time to investigate disturbing places in the daytime.
Two stations away from here, I'm sure it's irrelevant, but I still have time before nightfall, so I'll go there anyway.

From the terminal at Kushigata Station, it takes 20 minutes by bus.
It took another 20 minutes to walk from the nearest bus stop.
In the middle of the factory district, away from the residential area, the former hospital was quietly exposing its corpse.

It was a waste of time, but I guess that's what research is all about. I return to the main gate to check the time of the next bus.
There is a return bus in ten minutes. If I ran, I could make it just in time.
I shrug my shoulders and decided to run to the bus stop.

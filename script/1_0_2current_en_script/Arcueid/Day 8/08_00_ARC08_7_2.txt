 After climbing up the hill, I reach the main gate of the mansion.
 It's around two in the morning.
 I'm getting sleepy.
<Page2>
"Hey... Damn, the main gate's closed."
 The main gate is shut.
 Until last night, it was open after I left and until I came back...
<Page3>
"I turned off the auto-lock..."
 Maybe the locking system has changed.
<Page4>
 Whatever it is, I'm in trouble.
 It's not impossible to climb up and get in, but the alarm will go off and I don't want to 'kill' the lock.
 There would definitely be a family meeting tomorrow if I did. Using my eyes will be a last resort.
<Page5>
"I think the mansion used to have a back gate..."
<Page6>
"Ha... ha, a..."
 I lean back against the wall and pause.
 I had been examining the area around the mansion, but the fatigue of the day has finally made me dizzy.
<Page7>
 ...It's a precursor to anemia. My breathing is a little labored.
 I want to lie down right away, but unfortunately, the situation is not looking good.
<Page8>
 I couldn't find anything that looked like a back door as far as I could walk.
 This high wall goes on forever. After all this time, I fully realize the size of the Tohno family's property.
<Page9>
The only way to get in is to go around the national highway, climb up the hill, and enter from the forest... According to the map on my phone, the road to the forest is about three kilometers long.
<Page10>
"...I hope I can keep my strength..."
 More than that, I don't want to walk alone in the forest at night.
 There are lights on the road, but once you enter the forest, it's completely dark.
 Just the thought of walking there in the middle of the night sends chills down my spine.
<Page11>
"Huh?"
 What's that?
 Halway between two streetlights. In the dark where no light reaches, something is standing―――
<Page12>
 ――――Thump.
 I feel like the speed of blood flow in my body has doubled. It might be an illusion.
 That thing is clearly human.
 It just doesn't look right. The outline is alien.
<Page13>
 It's getting closer and closer.
 Click, clack, click.
 I can hear the sound of dry footsteps.
 There, a single bare eyeball stares at me, blood pumping.
<Page14>
　――――Thu, mp.
 I release the knife's blade.
 I place my hand on the rim of my glasses.
 A chill crawls up my spine like a <hundred feet.|centipede>
 The shadow will enter a deadly distance with one more step.
 Suddenly―――The streetlights cut out with a bang.
<Page15>
 The moon is also hidden in the clouds.
 The world suddenly goes dark.
<Page16>
"!"
 ――――Thu, mp.
 My heart leaps as if to announce my death.
 Vertigo clings to my ankles like mud.
 I try to jump back, but the thought doesn't reach my body in time.
<Page17>
 A blade in the dark.
 In one stroke, I hear the sound of flesh tearing just above my heart.
<Page18>
"Ah―――Eh?
 ―――I don't understand at all.
 But, the only thing I can think about is the knife sticking out of my chest.
<Page19>
 The moon peeks through the clouds for a moment, revealing the figure of a person.
<Page20>
 An eerie figure painted in a black haze.
 Ah―――it's nostalgic, somehow.
 That's the last thing I see.

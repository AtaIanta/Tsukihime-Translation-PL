I came back to the mansion.
The sun hasn't set yet and Akiha has not returned.
<Page2>
"Akiha, I bet you're still angry since this morning......"
It was natural for Akiha to be angry at mine behavior.
<Page3>
I haven't done anything good since I got back.
I wish I could tell the truth about the situation, but I don't think anyone would believe a vampire story.　
I'm going to be the sloppy brother for a while, and I'm going to be the hated person.

"Welcome home, Shiki-sama."
"I'm back, Hisui. Thank you for welcoming me.
...... Well, has Akiha not come home yet?"
<Page5>
"Yes. I have been told that she will return late tonight, so I have been asked to tell you that you need to finish dinner on your own."
<Page6>
...... I see.
I was hoping to at least talk to her about whatever subject she had, but that's a shame.
I think I'll just go back to my room and relax for the rest of the day.
<Page7>
"...Shiki-sama."
"Hmm?　What, Hisui?"
Hisui glanced around the lobby, and then called out to me again.
<Page8>
"I'm sorry to ask this, but will you be going out again tonight, Shiki-sama?"
<Page9>
Hisui looks straight at me.
I don't care if she know that I'm trying to slip out.......
This is because Hisui knows that I am not in my room every night.
It's natural to think that I might try to slip again. 
<Page10>
But the issue is the purpose of this question.
As a servant, she wants to know at what time I will be back...... but informing Hisui means that Akiha will know too.
<Page11>
......This is not a question that can be casually addressed.
Here I will---
C:>...speak honestly.
C:>...lie and deceive.

I will go with Dr. Arach.
I still don't know what kind of person she is, but since she's wearing a white coat, I'm pretty sure she's a doctor.
<Page2>
"I understand. I'll let Dr. Arach know, so please wait in your room.
Dr. Arach is an unpredictable person, but she is a very skilled doctor. If you're going to live here, you'll see her often, so please take this opportunity to deepen your friendship with her."
<Page3>
Akiha's voice was plain and unconcerned.
It was as simple as telling you a message.
......Well.
For now, let's have breakfast, and then I'll see the doctor.
<Page4>
I passed the time by reading a paperback book in my room.
It was almost 10:00 a.m. when I looked through the window and saw a white coat strolling down the hallway.
I put my book away.
At the same time,
<Page5>
"Hiii, mornin' gloomy-chan!
You want me to play with your body in the morning, #Shiki-chan, you're so horny! #I wonder if I'm going to fall prey to the stew-like juvenile puberty disease!"
<Page6>
Without even knocking, a drunken person walked in with a fancy bag in hand.
I regret that I didn't choose Kohaku-san this time.
<Page7>
"I'm sorry. I think I asked the wrong person, so can I ask you to leave?"
"Ah, no, no, no, I'm totally serious, but also joking. It's been a long time since I've been to an outpatient clinic, so I'm not sure how close I should be to the patients. I thought it would be better to greet frankly. I tried to be considerate."
<Page8>
While saying something like that, Mr. Arach started to walk up to the bed. A flashy model walk... The chest and hips are twisting more than necessary ... Despite that, there is no footsteps, and it is a ninja-like stealth movement.
<Page9>
In the past, this was still ringing in my heels, but this time it was a medical examination, and I wondered if she was taking me a little more seriously.
<Page10>
"Soo, show out the affected part. Show it out right away. If necessary, get naked! But then I' m not going to be able to hold back my overflowing interest for even a second, so don't hold back or I'll eat you.♡"
"......You are not drunk, are you?"
<Page11>
"I'm not drinking, okay? I'm always sober. Rather than consuming alcohol I prefer eating chocolate, choco."
......Indeed, I don't smell any alcohol.
This tension is not normal.
<Page12>
"Oh, you've been very honest with me. But you're just going to pull up the hem? What about whole pants? Why don't you just strip down to your underwear? The time when a man's nakedness is beautiful is at most 25, so now Isn't it a waste if you don't have an exposure habit?"
"Just hurry up and see me, Doctor.
I have a limit to my patience."
<Page13>
"Did you just say 'doctor'? Did you just say 'doctor'? I think you did, didn't you?"
"......Well. You' re wearing a lab coat, and you' re kind of, you know..."
She is just the scientist with a made-up name.
<Page14>
"I love you. I love you like Godiva. Okay, let's get serious."
<Page15>
Dr. Arach sits down and palpate my legs.
......it is a strange feeling.
It doesn't feel like her fingers are tracing my skin, but rather they are something that echoes into my body, but there is no pain at all.
The palpation was like the sonar of a submarine.
<Page16>
"Oh nooo~, you've got a crack in your bone.
Shiki-chan is a masochist. I can't stand this kind of thing!"
<Page17>
Oh...... so this is what it is.
I am rather glad that it is only a crack.
It would be not surprising if the bone were broken in some places.
<Page18>
"Hmm, but that's weird, isn't it? If there's a crack here, then it should be broken around here. #Hmmm... #I'm going to pull something out of my mouth."
"What? Yoooou, what are you doing right now?"
<Page19>
"Just a little disinfection. #Hmm, but I don't need to reopen this wound. Just secure it and it'll be healed tomorrow. Arach is borred."
<Page20>
Dr. Arach...... scratched her head in frustration and pulled out some medical equipment from her bag.
She put on a new pair of plastic gloves, which were now sealed, and prepared a syringe.
<Page21>
"I'll give you some painkillers, do you mind? Just in case. Although you don't need it, but master-chan asked me to be careful."
<Page22>
With a fluid motion, Dr. Arach gave me an injection in my left leg.
After that, she taped my heel and bandaged it to complete the treatment.
......It was really a brilliant job.
It is comparable to the old man in the clinic who was indebted to me when I was at Arima's house. She's a great doctor if she keeps her mouth shut, I think?
<Page23>
"Thank you very much. Thank you for your help."
"It's okay. I'm not licensed and I'm not a specialist. My real job is as a researcher. #Shiki-chan, you called me doctor, right?"
<Page24>
It seems that she is very happy to be called Doctor.
 ……In this situation, it also seems that Akiha or others have never called her that. 
<Page25>
"But, Shiki-chan, it looks like you put your body through a lot. Did you push the limits of the human body's mobility?
 I love that kind of crazy stuff, so I won't stop you from doing it again."
"Oh. You're not a doctor by profession, right?"
<Page26>
"Cha, Shiki-chan is harsh ♡
You look gentle, but are you cold-blooded? Is it like that? Are you a hybrid not only in body but also in mind? #How much do you know about your own body?"
<Page27>
"... Um, I have anemia, don't I?"
"No, not like that. It's about muscle and skeleton. Or engine and frame, if you prefer. You've got an unusual body, it feels like that when I touch it."
<Page28>
"There are two types of muscle, fast-twitch muscle for instantaneous power and slow-twitch muscle for endurance, and Shiki-chan is mainly fast-twitch. That's fine, but... your skeleton also has the bones that are light. It's like you were born with the ability to disguise your weight and float. Something like that?"
<Page29>
"It's like I'm a bird with light bones."
<Page30>
"Oh, yeah, just like that!
It doesn't come naturally, does it? You must have put a lot of thought into the breeding. Shiki-chan is a thoroughbred, born only to run ten seconds.
Ufufu. Even though you are a brother and sister, you are the exact opposite of the owner-chan♡"
"......I am the opposite of Akiha, what?"
<Page31>
"Yes. The Tohno family's children are all the result of a combination of excellent and old genes, a hetero-breeding, but the 'head of the family'-chan, is a bit of an exception. Or rather, is it a miracle?
Ancestry... Well, segregation. You had the pure pattern before you started breeding.
That's right. If you're a one-in-a-decade talent, she's a...... one-in-a-decade, one-in-a-hundred, one-in-a-thousand, how many years do you think?
<Page32>
Dr. Arach's mouth quirked up as he talked about this.
 I think...
C:>One in decade, maybe?
C:>One in century, maybe?
C:>One in millenium, maybe?

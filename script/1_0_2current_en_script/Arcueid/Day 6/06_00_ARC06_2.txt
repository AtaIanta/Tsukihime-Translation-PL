"I understand. I will refrain from pursuing this matter any further.
I am also at fault for the lack of contact."
"?  Akiha, how could you have done anything?"

"I understand. I will refrain from pursuing this matter any further.

"?  Akiha, how could you have done anything?"
<Page4>
"?  Akiha, how could you have done anything?"
<Page5>
"I'm the one who took away your cell phone.
If you had it, even one as careless as Nii-san would have at least tried to contact me, no?"
<Page6>
"----"
Oh... no, actually, that is...
Kohaku... secretly... returned it to me... you see...
<Page7>
"However, #that's just this one time. Please refrain from such conduct in the future. You're the only male member of the Tohno family, so you need to understand your position a little better.
If bad publicity were to spread, it would affect the Tohno family's future social interactions."
<Page8>
Future socialzing? ...Between me and some prestigious other family?
<Page9>
"No, that's not a problem. The relatives have never cared about what I did. 
In fact, you're the heir to the family. If you care about status like that, why not just send me away and find a more suitable son-in-law?
"----"
<Page10>
...?
For some reason, Akiha fell silent.
"What's wrong? Are you feeling sick, Akiha?"
<Page11>
"I'm fine. If you can afford to think about me, please take better care of yourself.
You're the one with chronic anemia, Nii-san."
"...Mmm."
She's right, my anemia strikes fairly often.
<Page12>
"In any case, please do not leave the house alone too often.
The city is very dangerous these days. Someone like Nii-san is just asking to be attacked by street thugs."
<Page13>
"That's alright. Those incidents will never happen again."
<Page14>
The series of murders that had the city in an uproar.
Reportedly a modern-day vampire, the culprit had yet to be discovered, and the darkness of the night threatened people.
But, that's all in the past now. 
<Page15>
"-Hmm?"
"I mean that there aren't any more vampires. The killer's already been caught."
<Page16>
"Is that so?ã€€#That's good news, but... Nii-san, how do you know all this?"
"W, well. I just happened to be at the scene of the arrest."
<Page17>
Just happened to, I laugh to myself.
I suppose it really was all just a coincidence.
<Page18>
The two days I spent with Arcueid.
So much has happened that it still feels like a dream, but anyway, the monster that had been nesting in the city is gone.
At least that much I can proudly say was the right choice.
<Page19>
"Nii-san? What's the matter, you suddenly look so happy."
"It's nothing.
I just finally realized that it was all over."
<Page20>
I smile unconsiously and murmur to myself.
At any rate, even with this kind of explanation, Akiha accepted it.
I thank her and stand up.
<Page21>
"Well, now that I feel better, I'm starving. Can I go get some breakfast?"
<Page22>
"Y, you do not need to ask me for permission.
I don't need to supervise your breakfast, so please feel free to get some. I'm sure Kohaku is in the kitchen preparing it."
"Thank you. Then, if you'll excuse me."
<Page23>
I start walking towards the doorway.
Tch... My left leg, it still hurts.
<Page24>
"Wait, Nii-san.
I have been wondering about it for a while, but now it seems clear. You've injured your leg, haven't you?"
<Page25>
"Ah... No, it's more like a sprain or a muscle strain. Anyway, it's not a serious injury, so don't worry about it."
"I see. No big deal, then."
<Page26>
Akiha walks over to me.
And then, just like that, she makes eye contact with me.
<Page27>
"There."
"UWAAAAAAH?!"
She targets the most swollen section on the back of my left foot with razor-sharp precision---!
<Page28>
"What a surprise. Even your poker face is fragile when it comes to direct pain."
<Page29>
"That's dirty. I mean, I should be the surprised one!
You knew just what you were doing, didn't you?!"
<Page30>
"You misunderstand. I was just trying to be as honest as I could, believing my brother's words that it wasn't a serious injury."
<Page31>
Fufu, the demon sister smiles gracefully.  
What the hell, isn't that too obvious? It's clearly payback for me not telling her what happened.
<Page32>
Akiha returned to the sofa in an unconcerned but extremely good mood and elegantly sipped her tea.
<Page33>
"Well. You're right, it wasn't much of an injury, but it wouldn't do to leave it alone."
<Page34>
"Nii-san, as family head, I order you.
As soon as you have finished your breakfast, go see a doctor. Regardless of the reason for your injury, it's inconvenient to be in so much pain."
<Page35>
"Sure, I'll go to a doctor, but... don't you want to ask how I got hurt?"
<Page36>
"I'm not interested. It's probably something silly anyway. But, even if I did ask, you wouldn't tell me, would you, Nii-san?"
A curt reply from the head of the family.
<Page37>
"Sprains with no external injury can be handled by Kohaku.
Oh... well, Dr. Arach was here this morning as well, wasn't she?
She was originally a surgeon.
Kohaku for basic treatment, or the former doctor Arach.
Please choose whichever you like."
<Page38>
...What an unexpected turn of events.
I'll-
C:>Have Kohaku take care of me.
C:>Have Dr. Arach take care of me.

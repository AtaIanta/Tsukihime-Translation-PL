The soft sunlight dispels my sleep.
Even with my eyes closed, I can feel the stillness on my skin.
The air is cool, yet gentle.
The sky seems to be the clearest it's ever been today.
<Page2>
Then, I should get up and go to school.
After all, for the past two days, I've been in such trouble that I forgot I'm a student-
<Page3>
"......."
...I wake up.
My body is lying in bed and my glasses are under my pillow.
<Page4>
I put them on by reflex and let my gaze wander.
The sunlight through the window is so bright that I can almost hear it calling me outside.
<Page5>
I take a deep breath, #enjoying the fresh air.
...Alright. It's Sunday, so there's no school.
<Page6>
The hands of the clock are ticking.
I can hear the birds chirping outside.
―――Oh, I'm back.
It's a normal morning, but now it feels so pure.
<Page7>
"―――I'm glad."
It's not because I'm alive, or that I was able to do something about <that vampire|Vlov>.
After experiencing that extraordinary event, I've come back to my daily life. I can enjoy this morning without worry.
For a simple person like me, it's the best possible reward, and-
<Page8>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama.#"
"UWAAAAAAH!"
<Page9>
My upper body shoots up.
I look over and see Hisui standing by the door.
<Page10>
"Hi, Hisui..."
<Page11>
"I apologize.
You didn't seem to notice me, so I called out to you..."
"Ah... no, I'm sorry as well."
<Page12>
I'm startled.
I just woke up and my heart is already racing...
<Page13>
"...Huh? It's not even 7 o'clock yet."
"Yes. It's a little bit earlier than when you normally wake up, Shiki-sama."
"That's right. Then, what are you doing here, Hisui?"
<Page14>
"I'm here to wake you up.
Akiha-sama has told me to bring you to her to explain the circumstances of the last two days."
<Page15>
"――――――"
"Akiha," "the last two days," "explanation."
The words fly around my brain wildly.
<Page16>
Resisting the temptation to abandon those thoughts, I take ten seconds to think.
...No matter how I consider it, I can't find any excuse for my behavior over the past two days.
<Page17>
Absent without permission. Breaking the curfew. No contact for two days.
Akiha is scary enough when I don't come home before dusk. I can't even imagine what kind of face she's making right now.
<Page18>
"...You know, Hisui.
To put it mildly, is Akiha angry...?"
<Page19>
"I wonder?
You will have to find out for yourself, Shiki-sama."
<Page20>
Okay. Hisui's voice is heartlessly cold.
If only I'd managed to crawl back to the mansion-
Wait, crawl?
<Page21>
"No, wait a minute.
Before that, why was I asleep in my room...?
"Shiki-sama returned last night after 2:00 am.
You were asleep at the door, but my sister noticed you and took you to your room."
<Page22>
"――――――――"
...My mouth hangs open.
I came home late at night with no warning and slept at the door without going back to my room, like some wild drunk who missed the last train.
<Page23>
"I'm becoming more like a cat than a human..."
Arcueid's face springs to mind.
Well, I guess I should be grateful that she carried me to the doorway...
<Page24>
Anyway, I've got the situation under control.
"I'll be right there. I'd appreciate it if you could tell Akiha to... try to stay as calm as possible."
<Page25>
"I am sorry, but I am afraid I cannot do that."
<Page26>
Hisui replies firmly.
In the hierarchy of the Tohno mansion, my status has fallen to the lowest level, no doubt about it.
Since Akiha is the head of the household and is angry with me, it's only natural that I have no allies here.
<Page27>
Anyway, let's get up.
I can't start by staying in bed forever.
<Page28>
"――――"
O―――uch.
As soon as I stand up, I feel a tearing pain in my leg.
<Page29>
...Of course. It's surprising enough that I'm even alive.
After all that recklessness, it would be unnatural for me to greet the morning so easily.
<Page30>
"...Shiki-sama?
Can I help you get up? You're... sweating so heavily..."
<Page31>
Sweat is pouring off my forehead.
It seems the pain of trying to walk is enough to make my body react that badly.
<Page32>
"If you're not feeling well, would you like to wait a little while longer?
I know what I said earlier, but if I tell Akiha-sama..."
<Page33>
"No, it's alright. It's just a sprain, it'll go away soon.
I'm more afraid of Akiha. If I procrastinate, she'll get even angrier."
"――――"
<Page34>
Hisui's eyes accuse me of telling lies.
However, given her position, she can't question me about it.
...I'm sorry, but I'll have to rely on this obvious subterfuge for now.
<Page35>
"I'll go to the lobby when I'm dressed.
It'll only be a minute, so just wait for me in the hallway."
<Page36>
"...As you wish.
Please don't be too hard on yourself."
<Page37>
Hisui bowed deeply and left the room.
I changed out of my nightgown and into my casual clothes, trying to keep my body as still as possible.
My first trip to my parents' house in seven years is off to a rocky start.

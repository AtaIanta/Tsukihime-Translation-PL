<Page1>
I'll let Kohaku take care of me.
A compress and some painkillers will be enough.
<Page2>
"I see. Then, go by your room after breakfast.
I have a dinner to attend this evening, so I'll be going out, but I hope you won't get too carried away just because I'm away, Nii-san.
<Page3>
Mysteriously happy, Akiha smiles reassuringly.
...Well.
Breakfast for now, and then I'll see the doctor.
<Page4>
"Thanks for waiting!"# Kohaku comes in with a retro wooden box.
<Page5>
"Sorry, Kohaku. I didn't mean to interrupt your busy schedule.
"No, no. It's a holiday today, so there's not much work to be done. Don't worry about it.
It's your request, after all. As long as it doesn't bother you, I'm happy to help."
<Page6>
Kohaku comes to the bed with a beaming smile on her face.
<Page7>
"Okay, time for your examination. Please take a seat on the bed. The problem.... #I see, so it's not just your left leg, but your entire lower body?"
<Page8>
"Eh... you can tell just by looking?"
"Yes, I can do that much. I'm not licensed, but I've been trained since childhood in medicine and osteopathy."
<Page9>
Medicine and osteopathy... So that's what Akiha meant when she referred to Kohaku as an "internal medicine" specialist.
I sit down on the bed, roll up the legs of my pants, and let her examine my left leg.
<Page10>
A light touch. Every time Kohaku's finger traces my shin, I almost scream out in pain.
And...
<Page11>
"Say... Shiki?
Is it possible that the bone is fractured?"
<Page12>
Ah... I knew it.
I'm glad it's only fractured, though.
I wouldn't have been surprised if it was broken in places.
<Page13>
"Maybe so. Only a little bit, though.
That's about the limit of my endurance."
<Page14>
"...Ha. I understand Akiha-sama's feelings a little more. The times when you look the most calm are actually when you're at your worst, aren't they?
Please wait a moment, and I will bring you some of my secret ointment and other things. Until then, don't move from the bed."
<Page15>
Kohaku walks out of the room with pattering footsteps.
...Left alone, I feel a little guilty for some reason.
I can't believe Kohaku sounded so listless just now.
<Page16>
Kohaku's treatment was more serious than I expected.
After the ointment, she tapes up my heel to stabilize it, and puts a cast over my entire shin.
<Page17>
"No, you don't need to do that much."
"Don't worry, I'll stop there.
Although, what do you think you're doing with your body?
Where did you get this injury in the first place? As the person entrusted with your health, I can't overlook this."
<Page18>
"Uh... no, you see..."
"Shiki, please be honest with me."
"It was... a fight, or something like that. Things got a little heated and we hit each other."
<Page19>
It was a poor excuse, but there was no other way to explain it.
I couldn't fool the serious Kohaku into thinking that it was nothing.
<Page20>
"A fight, is it? Jeez, that's no good.
I think it's okay to be naughty, but you can't be violent! It hurts both the person who raised their hand and the person who was struck."
<Page21>
"......"
Painful for the one who hits and the one who gets hit, huh?
Kohaku's words have an oddly poignant weight to them.
<Page22>
"...Yeah. You're right. Fighting someone does hurt like that."
"Right? I'm still discouraged that you're injured like this, though.
If this happens again, I'll be disappointed regardless of the circumstances."
"...Right, I'm reflecting on how stupid I was too. I'll work hard to make sure this never happens again."
<Page23>
"Okay, it's fine if you understand.
Now, take off your shirt so I can examine your upper body."
"Huh?"
<Page24>
Kohaku stands up in a fluid motion and grabs my shirt.
So. She's telling me to get naked. 
<Page25>
"W, wait a minute!
You don't have to go that far, it's only my legs that hurt!"
<Page26>
"What are you saying?
Your leg is bad, but I assure you it's your shoulders and lower back that are more troublesome. See, there's a little inflammation."
<Page27>
"Ow?! A pressure point, is that a pressure point? That vicious method of assault, could it be that you learned from the old man at Jinan Clinic?"
<Page28>
"Indeed. Dr. Jinan taught me a lot about your body.#  Also, it's not vicious. Please call it skillful fingerwork♡"
<Page29>
"Ha――――!"
I was easily knocked onto my back in the bed!
Dr. Jinan is a local osteopath who has been taking care of me since I was living in Arima's house.
He's at the top of the list for people I owe a debt of gratitude to, but he's also first for old men I need to beat up someday. 
<Page30>
"No, that's not the point! If it's irritated, I can put a compress on it myself! I don't need to be naked or anything!"
"-Haha. You're embarassed, aren't you, Shiki?"
Smiling, Kohaku ignores me and start to take off my shirt.
<Page31>
"I'm used to seeing your body, Shiki. Just give it up, please.
I had to change your clothes again last night. Everything down to the mole on your back is known to me."
<Page32>
"――――――"
That's right, I was in my nightgown when I woke up, not my school clothes!
<Page33>
"Hey, don't get out of control now. 
The cast on your leg will slip if you struggle."
<Page34>
...There's not much I can say to that. Not much, but the idea of being naked in front of Kohaku is a bit...
<Page35>
"Gosh. It can't be helped, then. I'll only examine your back. Then you won't be embarassed, will you?"
<Page36>
That's still embarassing, but it was the best concession I could make.
If I wanted to put a compress on my back, I'd have to get someone to do it for me anyway.
<Page37>
"...Okay. Please, go ahead."
I give up and relax.
"Let's disinfect it just in case. If you've been in a fight, you might have a small wound."
<Page38>
The antiseptic is sinking into my skin.
It had been such a long two days. Some of the wounds must have chafed unknowingly.
<Page39>
The antiseptic stings, but it's nothing compared to the dizziness of anemia. Every time she applies the antiseptic,
"Wow, you really are a boy-"
I think I was also able to endure the pain because Kohaku was so happy to see me.
<Page40>
And so the examination by Kohaku was over.
It was an hour of more serious examination than I had expected, and I'm reminded once again of the greatness of this woman.
<Page41>
"Thank you, Kohaku. My left leg doesn't hurt anymore and I can relax this afternoon."
<Page42>
"No no, it's my pleasure.
I'll get back to work now, if you don't mind.
If the pain doesn't go away or if it gets worse, please let me know right away. I'll be in the kitchen this afternoon preparing dinner."
Kohaku leaves the room with a lively smile on her face.
<Page43>
Alright.
I'll see what I can do this afternoon...

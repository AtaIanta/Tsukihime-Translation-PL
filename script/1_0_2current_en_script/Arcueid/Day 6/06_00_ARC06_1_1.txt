<Page1>
"...Right. I think that's the best way to go."
<Page2>
I can't talk about Arcuied or Vlov.
She would never understand, and I don't want her involved with that.
Since I can't tell the truth no matter what, I'll at least apologize honestly for my faults.
<Page3>
"Alright, let's go."
Taking a deep breath, I open the door to the living room.
<Page4>
"Good morning, #Nii-san. #Oddly, it feels like it's been a long time." # 
No, that's... isn't my sister a little too overpowering?
<Page5>
"Y, yo. Morning, Akiha." 
"No need to say hello, just sit down.
Yes, this will be a nice, long explanation, won't it?"
<Page6>
"............"
...Is it just my imagination, or does she look like she's having fun?
That's it. It's like a snake in front of a frog or something like that.
Perhaps it's a good idea to say hello and leave immediately?
<Page7>
"―――Nii-san?"
"Y, yeah, I'll sit down!"
<Page8>
My naive idea of running away dissipates with a single glance from Akiha.
I sit down on the sofa, holding back the pain in my left leg.
<Page9>
"I'm sitting now."
"You do not need to say it. ...Please do not kill my momentum with your bizarre attitude. It isn't fair."
<Page10>
"? What's not fair?"
"It's not fair. If you look at me like that, I'll relax――――#ahem.
<Page11>
After stopping her statement with a cough, Akiha glares at me even more harshly. 
<Page12>
"Nii-san. I was wondering, could you tell me about yesterday and the day before that?"
<Page13>
Akiha speaks gracefully and takes a teacup in her hand.
Although she says something like "could you tell me," it is definitely an order.
But as an older brother, I can't let her hear such a story. I'd rather have Akiha hate me than worry about me.
<Page14>
"That's the thing, Akiha."
"Yes, what is it?"
"To be frank, I can't explain the situation."
<Page15>
A crash.
With that, the teacup Akiha was holding drops onto the table.
No, it's more accurate to say she intentionally let it drop.
<Page16>
"Ahika-sama-"
"Oh, I apologize, Hisui. Could you clean that up for me?"
<Page17>
What a terrifying voice.
Hisui silently cleans up the spilled tea and the chipped... very expensive looking... teacup.
Still, what a terrifying voice.
After cleaning up, Hisui leaves the living room.
<Page18>
"So then, Nii-san."
"...What?"
"Can you tell me more about the events of the past two days?"
<Page19>
Have I gone back in time?
The head of the family is determined to make me talk. 
<Page20>
...Still, I can't talk about the situation.
Even if it doesn't help me, 
I can't let Akiha hear such a story. 
<Page21>
"...I can't tell you what you want to hear no matter how many times you ask.
I'm sorry for making you worry needlessly. I'm also sorry for not contacting you. Still, I can't talk about it no matter what."
<Page22>
"You say you feel bad, but you won't tell me anything, Nii-san.
Don't you even have an excuse?"
<Page23>
"...No, that's..."
As much as I'd like to explain myself,
<Page24>
"I don't have a good excuse.
But, I haven't done anything wrong in the last two days... I'd like to think."
<Page25>
...Right. Those two days were nothing but kill or be killed.
Even so, I want to believe that it was the right choice.
I had my own reasons for helping Arcueid, but most of all, I don't regret killing that vampire at all.
Even though I didn't act fast enough, at least no one will be killed via "bloodsucking" in the future. 
<Page26>
"...Sorry, Akiha.
I know it's frustrating, but please don't ask any more questions."
<Page27>
"―――――"
Akira stares into my eyes.
It's so intense that I struggle to breathe. 
<Page28>
"Is that so?
I suppose you have your own problems to deal with, and I cannot interfere with that."
"...Sorry. I appreciate you saying that."
"――――"

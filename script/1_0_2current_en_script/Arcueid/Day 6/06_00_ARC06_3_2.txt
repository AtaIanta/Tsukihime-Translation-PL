Let's take a tour around mansion.
I don't think much has changed since seven years ago, but I may find something that only a grown-up's perspective can see.
<Page2>
---Well.
Summing it up, I went around the mansion for about an hour.
<Page3>
"Aren't there too many off-limit areas?"
I asked in consensus, even though there was no one else here.
<Page4>
The main building of Tohno Residence is as large as hotel, and like a hotel has many rooms that are "off-limits to unauthorized personnel".
<Page5>
Especially the second floor of east wing was horrible.
Not "terrible" but "horrible".
Somehow, there you can feel a preassure.
Most rooms in mansion are locked so I couldn't enter them, but the second floor of east wing is not blocked by keys or doors.
However, when I try to step in, I feel dizzy and the corridor semms to start shaking...
<Page6>
"If you enter without permission, I will definitely kill you,
 I will feel a strong determination to do so..."
<Page7>
Quote from Akiha, mostly.
It is just paranoia, or maybe I am too concerned, but I felt that my social life was in danger, so I didn't enter the second floor of east wing.
<Page8>
"Yes, that was the right choice.
Don't go into the living space of the head of the family, whether you are part of the family or not.
This has been always the rule here, Shiki boy."
<Page9>
"―――"
Someone spoke to me from behin and my heart jumped.
I turn around and here he is.
<Page10>
"Have you finished exploring the mansion? As far as I'm concerned, I would prefer that those who recently came back stay in their rooms quiet."
"Thank you. I don't want strangers to walk around the house either."
<Page11>
"You are the only one who doesn't know me, but I will let that slide. It's an itch, but we are not in a position to get deeply involved with each other.
Today... that's right.
I guess I've been a bit distracted. I saw the back of your head, and it reminded me of old times. That's why I called out to you."
<Page12>
"Did you look at me...... and remember the old days......?"
...could it be...
<Page13>
"Oh. That was when Makihisa-san was still in perfect health.
He has been confined to his room for the past few years, but he has always been a lover of plants. This is how he used to walk around the house."
<Page14>
"Did I tell you that Makihisa-san had a deep knowledge of plants?
I used to munch on them a little too. We used to go to the botanical garden there and talk about them."
"The botanical garden...... is locked up tight too."
<Page15>
"The entrance is. The back door can be opened with a simple key.
Is it Kohaku-jo who has it? Thankfully, she still seems to be taking care of garden at the very least."
<Page16>
"............"
That's a little surprising.
Saiki-shi gave Kohaku-san the honorific title of "Miss".
He's not the kind of person who looks down on you excessively...... just because you're a servant?
<Page17>
"You, are you close to Kohaku-san?"
"Me? With that maid? ...ha.
 Haha. Hahaha. #HAHAHAHAHA!"
<Page18>
The man chuckled sarcastically and then began to laugh in earnest.
I don't need to ask what was so funny.
......Saiki Gotou is now laughing at the ridiculousness of the person in front of him.
<Page19>
".....Did I say something funny?"
"Oh, no, excuse me.
Yeah, that was my fault. After all, it's not your fault. It was just a bad question, that's all."
<Page20>
"I'm not that close to Kohaku-jo. It was only after Akiha became the head of the family that I started talking to her.
Miss Amber is also Akiha's secretary. Inevitably, there were more opportunities for conversation.
If anything, though, I'm more acquainted with Hisui-jo."
<Page21>
"What?"
Something unexpected for the second time.
That monstrous Saiki Gotou and Hisui know each other...?
<Page22>
"It was a long time ago, that too.
I haven't spoken to her at all in a few years. We say each other hello, though.
Well. I've been in the sun too much. My skin itches."
<Page23>
Saiki raised one hand and a car waiting in the parking lot moved to the roundabout in front of the entrance.
So much for conversation, I guess.
<Page24>
"Oh, I forgot to ask the main question.
 What are your impressions after seeing the mansion for the first time in seven years?"
"I'm not particularly impressed. It's only on the first floor that I was able to match my childhood memories."
<Page25>
I reply to the gentleman in bandages, Saiki Gotou.
"What an uninteresting thing to say.
 ......But that's right. Even if you come back from the past, there is no such thing as a misleading reality. "
<Page26>
After saying what he wanted to say, Saiki left the Tohno residence.
He has been visiting the Tohno residence quite often, but I wonder if he has a residence in Souya.
<Page27>
"......I'll try to get into that next......."
There is no doubt that Saiki is looking at me as an enemy or even as a hindrance.
As a means of self-defense, I should know a little bit of information about him.
You must know your enemy before fighting.
<Page28>
"Well, that's it."
I don't want to end my holiday with current feelings.
So I regain my composure and resume exploration of the mansion.
This time, well......Let's go to the courtyard.

Yes, let's tell the truth!
I don't want to tell Akiba a lie, and I don't think I can fool her in the first place.
<Page2>
After all, honesty is the best for human beings. I'm sure Akiba will understand if I explain in detail and with sincerity.
I'm totally sane just because it's desperation.
<Page3>
"...Okay, here we go!"
From here on, it's all about fucking guts.
I took a deep breath and opened the door to the living room.
<Page4>
"Good morning, Nii-san.
Strangely, it feels like it's been a long time..."
<Page5>
"Yeah. Good morning, Akiha.
<Page6>
I accepted the "I'm angry" look with a smiling face (50 DEF points) and sat down to face Akiha.
My heel hurt a lot, but I managed to get through it with a smile.
<Page7>
"I didn't get a chance to say it before, but good morning to you too, Hisui.
 Thank you for earlier. I'll be counting on you."
<Page8>
I also expressed my gratitude to Hisui, who was standing by the wall.
I didn't know that my decision to be honest would lead to such a perfect good morning move, I will remember that.
<Page9>
"You seem to be in a very good mood.
 I thought that you were reflecting on your bad behavior of the past few days, and that you were feeling deflated."
<Page10>
"Of course, I'm sorry. I'm aware of my behaviour.
But that's not the same thing as being in a good mood. I'm just happy to see Akiha's face in the morning."
"------、#h"
<Page11>
Akiha froze like a statue.
Oh shit, I...... pissed her off, didn't I ......?
I see. It seems that being too honest is not good. I'll overwrite memory.
<Page12>
"Akiha-sama"
"---It's nothing, Hisui
Hovewer, it was a good call."
<Page13>
She coughed, and her expression calmed down with a sigh.
<Page14>
"Nii-san. I'm telling you, you can't fool me with such sentiments."
"I'm muffled."
<Page15>
"I will not be fooled by fancy words.
What I want to hear is a report of where you've been and what you've been doing for the past two days."
<Page16>
"That's the think, Akiha"
"Yes. What excuse will you give me, Nii-san?"
<Page17>
"It's a long story, so I'll keep it short.
I've been fighting vampires for the past two days.
You know that there's been a series of murders in Soya, right? The culprit was a vampire, but I was saved by a "good vampire" I met by chance.
So, I went straight to work with her and we fought the bad vampires."
<Page18>
"―――――――"
Akiha froze in place.
It was a natural reaction. And in the next moment.
<Page19>
"Are you stupid, Nii-san!!!!!" 
I can easily imagine her yelling at me.
<Page20>
But there's no other way to say it.
It's sad, but it's obvious that she won't believe me, so I'll just indulge in the 'brother with a terrible excuse'......
<Page21>
"....................."
.........?
It seems that being angry is angry, but Akiba doesn't say anything. 
<Page22>
"Hello, Akiha?
"Nii-san. Is that some kind of sick joke?"
"------"
Akiha quietly gives me a penetrating...... look that sees right into my heart.
<Page23>
"...... No, I'm not kidding."
"It's joke, right?"
"...... Well, I can't blame you for taking it that way."
I agree with her, because she is so serious.
<Page24>
"Very well. But in the future, even if it's a joke, please don't say such delusional things.
You never know where our relatives might be listening. I don't want to hear the rumor that Tohno Shiki is unfit to be the eldest son of the Tohno family."
<Page25>
......Akiha isn't angry or disappointed.
I can see that Akiha is concerned about my situation, even if her gaze is cold.
It was a pure "longing"...... that was as hard as steel.
<Page26>
"I'm sorry. Forget what I said. I was just playing a joke on you."
<Page27>
"......it's okay. I will not pursue this matter any further.
 I'm at fault too, for not contacting you."

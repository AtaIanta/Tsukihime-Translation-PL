I decide to take a walk in the garden.
I haven't been in there since I came back to the mansion.
Let's go and see how things have changed since seven years ago.
From where I stand, I should be able to get to the courtyard from the doorway behind the grand staircase.
<Page2>
I go out to the terrace.
It's located at the back of the living room.
<Page3>
When I was a child, this was where Akiha stayed when the weather was nice.
But for her, it was place of work rather than a place to relax.
Akiha never went out to the garden by herself, and this terrace was her range of movement.
<Page4>
"......That's right. I used to call out to her from the garden and attract her tutor's attention."
<Page5>
I think her tutor also told me that he wanted us to stop by here whenever we went out to play.
For me it was unfair for us to go to the forest by ourselves or something.
But in final result, I took Akiha out to the forest, and I was the one who got scolded.
<Page6>
I go out from the terrace to the garden.
To a child's eyes, the garden seemed endless, but now that I have a better perspective, I can see the whole scenery.
The number of flowers has decreased compared to seven years ago, but the atmosphere of the garden has not changed.
<Page7>
After a slow 10-minute walk, I arrived at gazebo.
It marks the end of the garden.
Further from here, there is only a dense forest.
Due to my injured leg, I decided to end my stroll.
<Page8>
"All things considered, that mansion is far from Japanese style."
I sit down on a rock and look out over the vast autumn garden.
<Page9>
From this point, mansion looks more like a castle than a western-style house. It must be a spectacular view for others, but it's so disproportionate to me that I can only smile.
As far as I can tell, this kind of scenery suits Akiha and...
<Page10>
"She is the other one, isn't she?"
The only one I can think of is that stunningly gorgeous woman.
<Page11>
"What was that?"
I shake my head to shake off my crazy imagination.
<Page12>
I don't know why I'm thinking about Arcueid here.
I'm not going to be see her again after all.
There is no reaseon for her to stay in this city after I killed the vampire that was our goal.
So... even if I think back here, there's no point to it.
<Page13>
"......that's right.
We've always had that kind of relationship. In fact, I'm glad that I don't have to do such reckless things anymore---"
<Page14>
I was about to say something but I closed my mouth.
Muttering an ineffectual lies will only bring emptiness.
......It's a relief to be rid of her, but whether it's a good thing is another matter.
<Page15>
Because, things still remain in my heart.
Regret, attachment, remorse, and so on.
She was a girl who brought nothing but trouble, but even so, it was ...... fun to be with her.
<Page16>
"......I am an idiot, am I?"
I don't know what's wrong with me, I was almost killed once.
The wound from last night still remains on my leg.
I remember how Vlov tried to kill me.
I don't want to go through something like that again.
<Page17>
Sighing, I left the gazebo.
On the way back, I took a walk in the courtyard to pass the time.
......But. Even after the sun goes down, I still have unidentified feelings.
And they are not easy to get rid of.

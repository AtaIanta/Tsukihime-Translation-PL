Hisui is waiting for me in the hallway.
My left leg is so badly injured that I want to scream with every step.
Well, all of my body feels heavy, but that's just minor muscle pain. It's not so bad.
<Page2>
I confirm with my hands that the cuts on my cheeks and shoulders that I had received from Vlov's ice shards have healed completely.
The unnatural lack of even a scar makes it obvious that it was Arcueid's work. She said she was going to treat it, and she certainly did.

"Shiki-sama. I'm sorry to impose, but please use this."
"?"
<Page4>
Jade gently holds out a long, thin stick.
It's a cane... no, a walker.
<Page5>
"I used to use this all the time."
"Yes. I remembered seeing it in the equipment room once. I had a sliver of hope that I might still find it somewhere."
<Page6>
Silver of hope is an understatement... I laugh, before noticing that Hisui's breath is coming in faith gasps.
She must have hurried to get it while I was still changing.
<Page7>
"Thanks. To be honest, I was feeling shocks of pain with every step. You're a big help."
"Yes. I'm glad to be of service."
<Page8>
The weight on my left leg is lessened by my left hand on the walker.
This way, I can walk without issue. I thank Hisui once again for her thoughtfulness, and we move together to the lobby.
<Page9>
---Well, we've arrived.
<Page10>
I put my walker up next to the door.
Just one door away, the head of the Tohno family, Akiha-sama... only one year younger than me... is waiting on her poor brother to explain himself...
This place is a terrible witch's cave.
<Page11>
No, there's no point in feeling sorry for myself.
This was also my own fault. No matter what the circumstances were, I was absent from school and didn't come home for two days.
It's no wonder that Akiha wanted an explanation.
<Page12>
Right here, I'll-
C:>Apologize honestly.
C:>Try to fool her.
C:>Tell her the truth.

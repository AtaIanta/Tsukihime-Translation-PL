I guess I have no choice but to deceive her somehow.
In the first place, I don't think she would believe me even if I tell her about Arcueid and Vlov.
If that's the case, I will have to go with the plan of telling as few lies as possible while avoiding the truth.
<Page2>
"―――Okay, let's go."
I take a deep breath and open the door to the living room.
<Page3>
Inside the living room, there is Akiha sitting on the sofa,
and Hisui standing by the wall, waiting.
<Page4>
"Good morning, Nii-san.
Contrary to expectation, you seem to have a rather refreshed look on your face. Did a good idea come into mind perhaps?"
<Page5>
"―――#Ugh"
A preemptive strike from Akiha which could not be taken as sarcasm or restraint.
<Page6>
"Y-Yeah. Good morning, Akiha.
...Is it okay, if I sit there?"
I point to the sofa in front of Akiha.
<Page7>
"Please feel free to do so... Hmm. It seems that you are willing to meekly confess."
<Page8>
"Hahaha. Oh man, it's almost as if I did something wrong huh."
"―――Almost?"
"I'll sit down for the time being."
<Page9>
Losing the argument, I sit down on the sofa.
The head of the family really is frightening.
<Page10>
"......"
Akiha keeps her mouth shut.
I get the feeling that she's expecting me to take the initiative... Or rather, that she won't forgive me if I don't do anything to break the ice.
<Page11>
A judge inciting a confession out of the defendant.
But I've already decided on a plan. I'm going to win this trial.
<Page12>
"I'm sorry that I didn't come home yesterday and the day before.
I had some urgent business to attend to."
<Page13>
"Urgent business, you say. Would you be so kind as to share the nature of this business, if you don't mind?"
<Page14>
"Well, I ran into a small acquaintance of mine out of nowhere, then things happened and I eventually ended up guiding him around town."
"Hmm. A small acquaintance, you say."
<Page15>
"Yeah. Although I only met this guy recently.
You see, that guy was not feeling well. But he had extremely urgent matters to take care of, so I couldn't leave him alone."
<Page16>
"And so you took a break from school and stayed out without permission, correct?
What a wonderful deed that is. So much so that I would have stuffed it and displayed it in a museum."
<Page17>
Akiha's gaze is cold.
It wasn't so much that she was angry, but rather that her eyes had the look of utter disgust.
... Did that 'Hmm' from earlier mean that she believes in my rough outline of events as something that actually happened?
<Page18>
"......"
"......."
The silence continues.
I try not to expose myself any further,
and Akiha tries to figure out which angle to break through me.
<Page19>
"And so, who might this acquaintance be?"
"Eh?"
"I asked you who is this acquaintance of yours."
<Page20>
Akiha looks straight into my eyes.
She clearly transmits that she has no intention of being deceived no matter what.
<Page21>
"Well, that's―――"
"If you can't tell me, then that means that you are guilty og something, Nii-san."
<Page22>
Akiha pierces me with her sharp gaze.
I feel like I would be attacked all at once if I were to look away, so I stare at Akiha's face in defeat.
<Page23>
...Well, not that it really matters.
But when I look at her again, I come to realize how much Akiha has really changed.
I wonder if it's brotherly stupidity to be fascinated by one's own sister.
<Page24>
She has a dignified posture, a clear tone of voice, and eyes that never waver. Even though Akiha always had these qualities since she was a child, the person in front of me now is rather―――
<Page25>
"Hey, Akiha."
"...? Yes, what is it, Nii-san?"
"You have rather thick eyebrows, don't you?"
"!?"
<Page26>
Akiha stands up, hitting her foot on the table.
<Page27>
"No, maybe thick isn't the right word. Maybe you have a strong impression because it's tensed up. It's not good if you wrinkle your brow so much."
Even if she's a beautiful woman with a lot of power, I think most men would run away with a strong gaze like that.
<Page28>
"It appears that my brother has no intention in answering me seriously."
"That's not true at all. Although it's just me saying this, I swear that I would never lie to you."
It's just that there are a lot of things I can't say.
<Page29>
"...Sigh. That's right, you're not the type to lie.
You've always been a person who couldn't decide between being sincere or dishonest since the early days."
<Page30>
"Really? I don't remember that much about the past."
"It's fine if you don't remember.
...It seems like I haven't changed either. To be asking such questions when I knew it was going to be like this, perhaps I haven't matured at all."

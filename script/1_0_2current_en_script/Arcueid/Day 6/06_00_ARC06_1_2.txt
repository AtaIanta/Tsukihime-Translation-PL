I guess I'll just have to deceive her somehow.
In the first place, I don't think she will believe me when I tell her about Arcueid and Vlov.
There is no choice but to go with the policy of minimal lieing and partial truth.
<Page2>
"...Okay, let's go."
I took a deep breath and opened the door leading to the living room.
<Page3>
In the living room, Akiha is sitting on the sofa.
There is also Hisui standing by the wall, waiting.
<Page4>
"Good morning, Nii-san.
You look more refreshed than I expected. Did something good occur to you?"
<Page5>
"―――#Uh"
It is Akiha's first attack, which cannot be taken as sarcasm or a check.
<Page6>
"Oh, yeah. Good morning, Akiha.
......Can I sit there?"
I pointed to the sofa in front of Akiha.
<Page7>
"Please feel free to do so...... Hmm. It seems that you are willing to meekly confess."
<Page8>
"Hahaha. Oh, man, it's like I did something wrong."
"...something like?"
"I'm gonna sit down first."
<Page9>
I sat down on the sofa, overwhelmed.
Owner-sama is really scary.
<Page10>
"………………"
Akiha is keeping her mouth shut.
Rather than expecting me to take the initiative ...... I feel that she is determined not to allow me to do anything without giving me permission.
<Page11>
The Judge is encouraging the defendant to confess.
But I've already decided on a plan. I'm going to win this trial.
<Page12>
"I'm sorry I didn't come home yesterday and ereyesterday.
I had some urgent business to attend to."
<Page13>
"Urgent business, I see. Can you tell me what kind of business it was if you didn't mind?"
<Page14>
"No, I bumped into a  little acquaintance of mine for a bit, and things got a little crazy, so I was guiding them around the city."
"Oh, yeah. A little acquaintance, I see."
<Page15>
"Yeah. I met this person recently.
They were not feeling well. But they had something to do, so I couldn't leave them alone."
<Page16>
"So you missed school and stayed overnight without permission.
It's a wonderful good deed. I'd like to have it stuffed and displayed in a museum."
<Page17>
Akiha's gaze was cold.
It wasn't so much that she was angry, but that her eyes were dumbstruck.
Hmm?　......Does that imply she believes the story I just outlined as "what actually happened"?
<Page18>
"………………"
"………………"
Silence followed.
I do not want to make any more mistakes.
Akiha was trying to figure out where to start to break it down.
<Page19>
"So, who are they?"
"What?"
"I asked, who is this acquaintance of yours"
<Page20>
She looked straight into my eyes.
I can clearly feel "I'm not going to be fooled" from her.
<Page21>
"No, that's..."
"If you can't tell me, it means you're guilty of something, Nii-san."
<Page22>
Akiha's gaze pierced me with a stare.
If I look away, I might be attacked at once, so I stare at Akiha's face while losing.
<Page23>
......No, not that it matters at all.
When I look at her again, I am reminded of how much Akiha has changed.
I wonder if it's also brotherly stupidity to be distracted by one's sister.
<Page24>
She has a dignified spine, a clear tone of voice, and eyes that never waver. Even though Akiha had always these qualities since she was a child, the person in front of me now was really...
<Page25>
"Hey, Akiha"
"......?　Yes, what is it, Nii-san?"
"You have rather thick eyebrows, don't you?"
"!?"
<Page26>
Akiha stood up, hooking her foot on the table.
<Page27>
"No, I don't think it's thick. Is it because they're so sharp and impressive? If you wrinkle your brow too much, it's not good."
She's a beautiful woman with a lot of power, but if she looks at someone too hard, most men will run away, right?
<Page28>
"It seems that my brother doesn't want to respond seriously."
"That's not true. I swear to you, I would never lie to Akiha."
It's just that there are a lot of things I can't say.
<Page29>
"......huh. You're right, you don't lie.
I've always been a person who can't decide whether you're sincere or dishonest."
<Page30>
"Really?　I don't remember much about the past."
"You don't have to remember.
......somehow, I haven't changed either. I know it's going to happen anyway, but I keep asking questions when."

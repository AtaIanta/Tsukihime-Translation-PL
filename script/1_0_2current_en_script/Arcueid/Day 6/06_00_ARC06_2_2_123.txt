"It was all so misleading!
We can't even compare it to man-made talent!
Our master Chan is a once-in-a-lifetime monster!"

"Oh my God, are you mad at me for belittling your sister? I thought I gave her the highest level of love."
"I see. Even if that's the case, please don't talk like that."
<Page4>
......Please don't use the "monster" as a metaphor.

"Oh, did I step on a landmine? I'm so scared! I'm scared, so I'm LEAVING!"
Dr. Arach runs to the door, her heels are clicking.
She doesn't stop to look at her back.

"But I'll give you some advice as a doctor.
If you're planning to get injured in the future, I can help you. Shiki-chan, You look like you're getting sick. What? Don't you want to get rid of the seven years of stagnation? But it's going to hurt like hell!"

"Yeah, I hope you're right.
See you later, Chao~â™¡ I'll always be waiting for you."
<Page10>
Dr. Arach left the room after giving me a throwaway kiss.
......Let's get back on track.
Now that I'm able to move, I need to figure out how to spend my afternoon.

The afternoon of my day off passed without incident.
I went back to my room to relax, and before I knew it, it was time for dinner.
<Page2>
"......I'm stunned. Forget about it......"
I shake off the blonde woman who stuck in my head.
People say days in Autumn are like a drop of vine but it was too fast even for that.
……It seems that I was indulged in unrelenting thoughts so much that I lost my sense of time.
<Page3>
In the dining room with me are Akiha、behind her Kohaku-san、and behind me Hisui.
<Page4>
The dinner, prepared by Kohaku-san, was a series of courses with wagyu beef as the main dish.
Perhaps it was the manners of the Tohno residence, but Akiha didn't utter a single word as she brought the main course to her mouth with a stern look on her face.
<Page5>
It was about an hour ago when Akiha returned.
Apparently, an unscheduled problem had arisen and she had been busy dealing with it.
<Page6>
"......Hisui. Just in case I'm not mistaken, is there a strict no-speaking policy at our dinner?"
I asked Hisui in a whisper, trying not to be overheard by Akiha.
<Page7>
"....No. The relatives were free to talk among themselves."
"......So Akiha's silence is simply because she's in a bad mood?"
<Page8>
"I'm sorry....... I don't know...... I'm just guessing, but I think Akiba-sama is tired."
"...... I see. You're right. She's always in a bad mood, but now she's in a particularly bad mood, I really appreciate her hard work."
<Page9>
Yes, I seriously sympathize with her.
It's not for me to say, but the only thing I can do for my sister, whose day off has been cut short by an unplanned event, is to give her a good night's rest. I don't dare to talk about it. It would be the best for Akiha.
<Page10>
"I heard you, Nii-san.
It's not that I'm tired from the afternoon inspection. It is our family's manners to eat quietly."
<Page11>
She glared at me.
It's not only obvious that she knows I'm talking to Hisui, but I'm also afraid that she knows what I was saying. She has got hellish ears.
<Page12>
"... But that's a thing of the past.
If you really need to talk, or want to discuss the day's events, that's fine."
<Page13>
I nodded my head and resumed eating.
Perhaps it was because I had eaten less breakfast and lunch, but my appetite had come back in the evening.
...... Still, tonight's menu was somewhat painful to the eyes.
Not only the beef fillet and foie gras, but also the bright red sauce reminds me of blood, which inevitably makes me think back to the events of yesterday.
<Page14>
A sudden murder. An unlikely reunion. An impossible monster.
The touch of death, the fingers stretched out on the back of so much death.
And... the natural farewell that I knew would happen once I defeated the vampire.
"……………"
...This is completely pathetic. I'm not sure if I've lost my fever after all that pondering, but I have.
<Page15>
"...So...
How did you spend your afternoon off, Nii-san, after all the <labor|work> you did for me?"
"Huh? Oh, yeah, you mean me. I went for a walk in the afternoon, and when I got back, I just lay in bed all day."
<Page16>
"Is it...... um, anemia again?"
"No, I was just thinking and before I knew it, it was evening. I don't feel bad, and my legs are fine."
<Page17>
"So you've wasted your time for nothing.
 ……Huh. Please don't say such trivial things out loud. I don't think anything of it, but if other people hear it, they'll laugh at you."
<Page18>
It was an unrelenting and irrefutable impression of Akiha.
Well, be that as it may,
<Page19>
"It was a statement that seemed to be self-defeating.
Rather, it was self-degrading, and I regret it.
But Akiha doesn't think anything of it, how come?"
Could it be that she just looks strict, but is generous to her immediate family?
<Page20>
"Why I don't think anything?
I don't expect anything from you.
I've known from the beginning what kind of person my Nii-san is."
<Page21>
"……………"
Well, that's a good point.
If you have no expectations, you will not be disappointed.
This is exactly what it means when there is no sound.
<Page22>
"So, thanks for the meal."
"Thanks for the meal. I have a lessons after dinner, so I'll be on my way. #Nii-san？ If you're feeling sorry for yourself, please go back to your room early tonight and work hard on your studies, okay?"
<Page23>
Akiha got up from her seat and left the dining room.
The evening lesson was a violin performance that was scheduled for the evening...... my inferiority complex starts thinking how high are her specs.
<Page24>
"Shiki-san, fight...! Don't let Akiha-sama beat you!"
The mischievous housekeeper waved her hand in support as she followed Akiba.
<Page25>
After dinner, I took an early bath and came back to my room.
I sat down at the study desk provided.
As Akiha suggested, I spread out my reference books to pay for the daytime I spent in self-indulgence.
<Page26>
No matter how many unrealistic incidents I have gone through, I am still a second year high school student. I have a lot of work to do.
<Page27>
"............... No. It's a pile, though."
But no matter how I try, I can't concentrate.
All that comes to my mind...
All I could think of was a woman who no longer needed me and should be forgotten.
<Page28>
"Oh my God, not today!"
I gave up and lay down on my bed, staring at the ceiling for no reason.
<Page29>
......Alright. It's only until tonight.
For better or worse, it's been a turbulent two days.
It would be crazy to forget it so easily.
I guess I need a day to cool down.
<Page30>
This is how I am now, drifting in and out of consciousness without doing anything.
I'm going to waste my time in a desperate attempt trying to keep the memory away and to dilute the feelings.
...if I do this, most of the events will become a thing of the past.
<Page31>
"……Nnn……"
Eventually, my eye lids begin to fall.
My consciousness slowly fades.
An unbearable darkness envelops my <five senses|body>.
<Page32>
......the day that had passed so peacefully ended like this.
As I lay in bed, I fell into a vague sleep, as if I was deceiving myself.

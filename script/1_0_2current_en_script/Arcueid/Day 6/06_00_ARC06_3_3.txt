Okay, let's go out to the area in front of the station.
I'm not sure if I'll be able to go down the hill with my legs, but if it hurts, I'll just go home.
<Page2>
When I said, "I'm leaving for a bit"# she came to see me off to the front door.
"What time will you be back, Shiki-sama?"
<Page3>
"You don't have to worry about me. I'll be back by this evening."
"Very well. Have a good day."
<Page4>
Hisui bows humbly to me.
Feeling embarrassed by this, I left the mansion.
<Page5>
When I regained thoughts, I was at the north exit of the station.
Not even a day had passed since last night's accident.
<Page6>
There are off-limits signs and a bunch of guards everywhere.
The number of guards is unusually large. One person is assigned every 5 meters.
Even cat cubs will have difficulty to enter.
<Page7>
.......Last night's fire is being reported as a gas explosion accident in an underground pipe.
The death toll is now over 20. More than 50 people have been injured.
The number of police officers is not included among them.
The flames. The records of those who bravely stood up to the vampires and were burned to death will not be disclosed to the public.
<Page8>
"......?"
Then I notice something strange.
The depressed area is tightly roped and off limits.
<Page9>
There is no one going in or out of it.
I thought area is packed with people investigating and reconstructing the accident......?
<Page10>
"……or rather, to begin with……"
There are not many police cars.
The area was guarded by a private security company, and there are not many policemen in sight.
The police seems to be short-staffed as they dealt with a string of accidents.
<Page11>
I leave the scene of the accident and return to the station.
I sit down on a bench and watch the crowds of people coming and going.
I wonder how long I had been doing that.......
Suddenly.
I spot the back of her and immediately stand up, but shortly after I realize that it was a mistake.
<Page12>
"―――What the hell is that?"
I have no reason to talk to her.
In the first place, there is also no reason for Arcueid to remain in this city, as long as our goal, or rather <that vampire|Vlov> is defeated.
It's...... ridiculous.
Killing time in such a place was mistake, why did I come out to the city for no reason?
<Page13>
"......that's right. I've always had that kind of relationship with her. In fact, I'm glad that I don't have to do such reckless things in this city anymore---"
<Page14>
I was about to say something but I closed my mouth.
Muttering an ineffectual lies will only bring emptiness.
......It's a relief to be rid of her, but whether it's a good thing is another matter.
<Page15>
Because, things still remain in my heart.
Regret, attachment, remorse, and so on.
She was a girl who brought nothing but trouble, but even so, it was...... fun to be with her.
<Page16>
"......I am an idiot, am I?"
I don't know what's wrong with me, I was almost killed once.
The wound from last night still remains on my leg.
I remember how Vlov tried to kill me.
I don't want to go through something like that again.
<Page17>
"It's almost evening, let's go back to the mansion."
I shook my head to cool down my fever and turn my back on the illusion of Arcueid that was never real.

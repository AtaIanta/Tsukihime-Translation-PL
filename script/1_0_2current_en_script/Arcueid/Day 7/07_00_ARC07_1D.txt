Today's classes are over and it's after school time#.
Or, I should say, before I knew it, it was after school.
Bad thoughts were running through my head, and before I knew it, there was no one in the classroom.
<Page2>
" ...... street murders are still going on.
 I don't need to think about what that means.
 But she said that she had never killed a human being.
 I can't believe she can be killer.
 I can't believe that she was lying.
<Page3>
"Is ...... news a mistake, or―――"
The only person who knows the answer is Arcueid herself.
If I can find her and meet her again, everything will clear up.
<Page4>
......I don't know who I am anymore.
I have nothing to do with that incident anymore.
<Page5>
I returned to my normal life when I finished with Vlov.
I've fulfilled my responsibility. I've done my part.
So there is no reason. There's no reason for me to venture into such an abnormal world again.
I should  pretend that I didn't notice anything and go home without thinking about it.
<Page6>
I'm going home.
That's probably the second most correct choice.
But I learned the first choice a long time ago.
<Page7>
"―――Life is full of pitfalls for any human being. You're capable of handling them, so you should be more cheerful.―――"
<Page8>
"...... That's right.
I just shouldn't choose to do nothing."
<Page9>
Those words saved my life.
That's what I've always tried to achieve.
Then I can't just turn a blind eye to it.
<Page10>
......The case is not over yet.
Since I had been involved in it, I am destined to be unable to escape from this trouble until the end of my life.
<Page11>
I leave the school.
I don't have many clues, but I do have the key to the apartment that she left with me and I never returned it.
Let's just go to the apartment.
<Page12>
"She isn't here ......?"
The apartment was still there, but there was no sign of Arcueid.
At least there are traces of her here. I was relieved to see that nothing had vanished in a puff of smoke.
<Page13>
"Never mind, I can't expect to catch you that easily.
Anyway, I just have to act now."
<Page14>
There is no guarantee that she will return even if I wait here.
......The only thing I can do is to go out into the city and look for her at random, like I did when I first saw her.
<Page15>
The sun was sinking and the city was changing its face to night#.
I looked around for the most important places, but I couldn't find even a glimpse of Arcueid.
<Page16>
"......How come I can't find her at times like this when she's just wandering around like nothing?"
<Page17>
......What should I do.
The night has only just begun, and I should――
C:>Go back to the mansion and sort it out.
C:>Let's not give up, search the city.

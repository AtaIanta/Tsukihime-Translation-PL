I returned to the mansion. It was midnight, and the lights of the house were completely out.
The entrance was unlocked.

"......Hisui, you kept the door open for me."
I let out a sigh of gratitude.
I walk into the house unannounced to avoid waking Akiha, Kohaku-san and the others.

"――――"
I took a deep breath and lay back on the bed.
Just as she had said, my body was extremely tired.
I fell down on the bed as if I was being sucked in.
<Page4>
".................. huh?"
I lay back down and exhaled heavily.
A promise to...... Arcueid.
For some reason, Tohno Shiki stepped into the trouble again.

"......can't help it though. I couldn't leave it alone."
Or did I not want to leave her alone?
That miraculous, beautiful, non-human creature.

"――――――"
This is ridiculous. After killing her with my own hands once, what kind of stupidity is this?
The only reason I'm helping to exterminate vampires is for the good of the city. I'm only helping because I'm in danger.

"......Yes. What else is there?"

...... Close the eye lids.
...... Remove your glasses.
Submit yourself to the giant hand of sleepiness that drags your body and consciousness into deep darkness.

......Anyway, I decided to help Arcueid again.
Let's not think about anything else for now, and get ready for tomorrow――――

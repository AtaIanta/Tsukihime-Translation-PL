I return to the mansion. It's midnight, and the lights of the house were completely out.
The entrance is unlocked.
<Page2>
"......Hisui, you kept it open for me."
I let out a sigh of gratitude.
I walk into the house silently to avoid waking up Akiha, Kohaku-san and the others.

"――――Fuu"
I take a deep breath and lay back on the bed.
It's just like as she said, my body was extremely tired.
I fell down on the bed as if I was sucked in.
<Page4>
".........Waa"
I lay back down and exhale heavily.
A promise with...... Arcueid.
For some reason, Tohno Shiki stepped into the trouble again.

"...But it can't be help, can it? I couldn't leave it alone."
Or did I not want to leave her alone?
That miraculous beauty of that non-human creature.

"――――――"
This is ridiculous. After killing her with my own hands once, what kind of stupidity is this?
The only reason I'm helping to exterminate vampires is for the safety of this city. I'm only helping her because I'm in danger.

"......Yes. What else is there?"
<Page8>
...Close the eye lids.
...Remove your glasses.
Submit yourself to the giant hand of sleepiness that drags your body and consciousness into deep darkness.
<Page9>
......Anyway, I have decided to help Arcueid again.
Let's not think about anything else for now, and get ready for tomorrow――――

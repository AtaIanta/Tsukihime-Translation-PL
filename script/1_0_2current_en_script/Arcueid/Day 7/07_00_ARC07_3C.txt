"That hurts. Dragging me out of the house like that, don't you have any common sense?"
The most beautiful face in the world says such a thing.
<Page2>
"What do you think you're doing!?　Coming into the mansion like a maniac, it's like you're trying to ruin my life, idiotic girl!"
<Page3>
"Idi.. idiotic girl, are you making fun of me?"
"I'm calling you an idiot because you're an idiot, so what else is there to say, you idiot? If you have a counter, I'm all ears."
"Eh- uh, wha?"
<Page4>
My head is at a complete boil.
I've never been in such an incomprehensible situation before, and I feel like I have to complain directly about whatever it is I'm dealing with.
<Page5>
"Come on, I just came to see you.
I don't think I did anything to make you so angry."
"...Just coming to see me. Arcueid, you aren't serious, right?"
<Page6>
"Y, yeah, so what?
There's nothing wrong with that, you know. I didn't even use my mystic eyes, I did everything in a very human way.
I didn't tell your sister about your mystic eyes or that I was a vampire, my lips were sealed."
<Page7>
"I shouldn't need to tell you that. At least you seem to have common sense when it comes to that subject."
<Page8>
"...I don't get it.
Since I did all that, why are you so angry?"
<Page9>
"It's because you don't think at all!
I'll be as clear as possible, okay?!　Think about how you look to everyone, be aware of your features!
And please, be a little more quiet! You stand out just by being here!"
<Page10>
...Ugh.
At any rate, it felt good to finally say what I wanted to.
But this girl, who says whatever she wants, is just the opposite.
Arcueid mews like a cat, glaring at me sullenly.
<Page11>
"What is this, why are you being so selfish?
Why do you think I stand out just by being here? I don't look any different from a human, do I?"
"A beautiful woman stands out just by being beautiful. It doesn't matter if she's human or not."
<Page12>
I say it back firmly.
Perhaps it was because my reply was straightforward, but Arcueid seemed to agree easily.
<Page13>
"...Well, I was out of line, too.
　I've never been in a situation like this before, so I was upset."
<Page14>
"...It's fine. I guess I was the one in the wrong.
Arcueid nodded dutifully.
Still, I'm guilty of thinking that she may have done even more than that.
<Page15>
"...Okay. Why did you even come to my house?
No, I wanted to talk to you too, so it's a good opportunity."
<Page16>
"Is that so?　I just came to see how you were doing."
"I see. You're just curious, then. Next time, hide behind a tree or something and sneak out for a look. Try not to be seen by anyone. If possible, don't let me see you either."
<Page17>
...I'm just so tired.
This isn't the first time I've been pushed around by her whims.
At least she didn't tell Akiha about the situation, and I think she understands my position.
<Page18>
"Anyway, I need to talk to you about something serious. I don't feel comfortable here, so let's go somewhere else, if that's okay?"
<Page19>
"Okay, but... what did you want to talk about?"
"You'll find out soon enough. ...Yeah, it's about time we went somewhere less crowded, so we can go around to the park."
<Page20>
"Let's go," I call out and start walking.
Arcueid nods her head and meekly follows me.

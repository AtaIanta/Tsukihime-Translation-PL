Only a few minutes have passed since I stopped by the convenience store.
It is now half an hour before my usual time to go to school.
<Page2>
The school uniforms on the sidewalk are sparse.
In another ten minutes, the main gate will be crowded with students, but for now there are only few, including myself.
There is also no sign of the beautiful woman, who sits on the guardrail waiting for someone.
<Page3>
In the schoolyard, the athletic club is having their morning practice.
I walk past them to the entrance.
I like to move my body. It makes me feel alive.
<Page4>
But I couldn't join the club activities.
I'm chronically anemic, so I'm afraid I'll be a nuisance to others when the time comes, and my doctor is urging me to refrain from excessive exercise.
<Page5>
When I was a freshman, I had opportunities to be invited to join club activities.
Each time, I turned them down, saying 'maybe next time'.
Each time, I felt an inexplicable gap between us.
<Page6>
...... In the end, that's what happened.
I'm sure it was a self-defense move, subconsciously sensing that I couldn't mix myself with that side no matter what.
<Page7>
"..............."
I cut off my boring sentimentality.
In my heart, I cheer for my friends who are working hard with their club activities and head for the school building.
<Page8>
"Oh, dear? Good morning Shiki-kun, aren't ya early this morning?"
"......Yes, I got the time wrong.
Good morning, Noel-sensei."
<Page9>
On my way to the classroom, I bumped into Noel-sensei.
Like me, Noel-sensei didn't expect anyone to be there at such a humdrum hour, and she looked a little bit sloppy.
<Page10>
" If you got the time wrong, you weren't late, you came to school early. Shiki-kun is such a diligent person. Shouldn't today's young people take life more easy?"
"I'm taking it easy enough. I don't even like to study.
More importantly, regarding that truancy on Friday......."
<Page11>
"Oh, that. Don't worry, I didn't call your home.
It's normal to boycott for one day. It would've been more convenient for Shiki-kun, right?"
<Page12>
Noel-sensei gives a meaningful chuckle and makes a statement that is not appropriate for a teacher.
......But it helps.
Or rather, it saved me. The reason Akiha wasn't too angry was because Friday's truancy wasn't exposed.
"――――――"
However, isn't Noel-sensei's educational policy a little too <generous|loose>?
<Page13>
"Oh, Shiki-kun, you're so stiff.
It's not that I'm not serious. It's just that I respect my students' independence. #It's just that everyone looks so young and delicious. I think it's inevitable that they'll have to relax and go out for a day or so."
"No, it's not like I was playing around or anything......."
<Page14>
"Y'know, I'm jokin'.
And I know, I know. It's the anemia, right? The earnest Shiki-kun wouldn't mess around with fire.
So, are you feeling okay? Are you still in pain?."
<Page15>
......I am worried.
Noel-sensei's joke is exactly on target, but I don't dare correct her.
<Page16>
"For someone with anemia, I'm feeling particularly good this morning."
<Page17>
"Yea. That's great. Then you can go back to your carefree student life from today. #By the way. You said that you have chronic anemia, but how long have you had it? Is it somethin' you were born with?"
<Page18>
"? I wasn't born with it. I involved in an accident as a child, and I've had it ever since."
"Well, ......, I'm sorry to hear that. That's why you don't exercise anymore, and why you always lose your appetite.
So, what was it like?"
<Page19>
"Yes?"
I couldn't help but raise my voice at the unintelligible question.
Noel-sensei was licking her lips with her tongue.
<Page20>
"I asked you what kind of accident you had.
Was your body injured so badly that you went crazy?
It was so painful that you were crying out in fear, wasn't it? Perhaps it was as if you died and were reborn again and again."
<Page21>
"――――――"
......I get unspeakable chills.
Not because of Noel-sensei's insensitive remarks. I've known since the very first day that this teacher was inquisitive or perhaps unpredictable.
The reason is that I don't remember the details of the accident at all.
<Page22>
"...... It was just an accident. It's not a big deal. It's time to go, so if you'll excuse me."
I bow to Noel-sensei and walk past her.
<Page23>
"Shiki-kun."
I turn around at the call of my name.
<Page24>
"If you're feelin' well, better do yar best from today onwards, and don't be absent without permission any more.♡"
The French returnee winked at me and headed for the staff room.
<Page25>
I thought I'd be the first to arrive, but I saw several of my classmates in the classroom.
"You're early, Tohno. What happened to you on Friday?"
"Hello. I was sick on Friday. Are you done with your morning practice?"
<Page26>
"Yeah, yeah. Not only after-school club activities, but also morning practice is becoming a matter of restraint. I just replaced the captain of the club, and I can't get control like this. You know?"
<Page27>
The athletic department, which seemed to be operating normally, was also affected by the vampire incidents.
Well, it's now just a matter of time. The incidents will disappear soon, and the club activities will return to normal.
<Page28>
Five minutes before homeroom.
As I chewed on my happiness, thinking that the day's classes would begin without any problems...
<Page29>
"Yoo-hoo, slacker! GOOD MORNING"
"――――――"
A voice called out from behind me, ruining my morning.
<Page30>
"Yello, delinquent! You had a nice hiatus on Friday!
Thanks to that, this morning is going to be even... more... energized? #But what the heck, hav' ya been sleepin' from Friday to Sunday?"
<Page31>
"I didn't fall asleep and I'm not sick.
I just happened to feel sick on Friday, but I recovered when I got home. I missed school because it seemed like too much trouble."
<Page32>
"Seriously. Yer only livin' in a luxurious mansion for three days and behave like aristocrat already? #You're still so gutsy and adaptable, it's like living in a capital city. Yeah, I don't envy you one bit!
<Page33>
Arihiko displays a tremendous strength.
This guy's rebellious spirit is something to be learned from.
<Page34>
"I'm telling you, I'm not used to this.
You haven't seen how big that house is.......? Arihiko, do you know the Tono mansion?"
<Page35>
"Nah, I don't know. I know nothing about it. I mean, it's that high up, and it's surrounded by fences and woods right? You can't look at it unless you go inside the compound.
No, I want to see it, but I don't hav' guts. But you see, your house, security and so on, is great, right?
<Page36>
"I don't know. ...... Oh no, Keiko-san said that there were burglaries several times a year but the police never rushed to the Tohno mansion. Haven't you ever heard of those burglaries?"
<Page37>
"Oh, my... Bandits break in a few times a year and the police don't show up... Isn't that bad? It's like an anthill, isn't it?"
"? What?"
Since they're catching the thief before the police could get there, isn't the security excellent rather than <vulnerable|yucky>?
<Page38>
"No, that's why. Maybe the thieves didn't come out in the first place."
"I see. Then any rumor will not spread."
<Page39>
We nodded at each other with straight faces.
......Thinking about this topic any longer was terrifying, so we decided to switch topics as best as we could.
<Page40>
"Oh, yeah. Have you seen the scene of Saturday's accident? The big fire in front of the north station. I heard it was a fire that broke out in the underground."
"...... No, I haven't seen it yet. I've only heard about it."
<Page41>
"Look, there was a department store at the north gate before it was renovated. The park that used to be in front of it was sunk underground. It's going to take a year to restore it.
But it's not all bad news. The security guards and TV stations were all over the place, and the <newbies|fools> at the north gate have gone into hiding."
<Page42>
"I see. ...... So, what about the hotel at Kuramiyabashi Station?"
"The hotel in Kuramiyabashi, is that the Dome Hotel? Ah...... Oh, by the way, there was a fire there too. I forgot about it because the north gate was so badly damaged."
<Page43>
......Arihiko can not be blamed for being frivolous.
Even though so many people were burned to death in the incident, for Arihiko it was just a story from a neighboring town.
In this day and age where news are updated daily, no matter how painful the event is, it will be overwritten and consumed by the next horrific news.
<Page44>
"...... Whatever it is, it's still a disturbing thing, isn't it?
Also, what about you? You have had anemia since middle school, but you never missed a day of school. Well, there were a few times when you left the moment you got to school tho."
"It sometimes happens. I went to school until I reached the crossroads, where I got sick and had to go back."
<Page45>
"Hmm. You and Yumizuka have been behaving poorly lately, haven't you?"
"I'm not denying that we're behaving poorly, but......, what's wrong with Yumizuka-san?"
<Page46>
" She hasn't been here since Thursday. She didn't show up this morning either. She's been an honor student for a long time, so she might has been overwhelmed from all the flirting."
"..............."
Arihiko's metaphors are rather unique.#.
<Page47>
"Oops, that's it for me.
Seeya later, and study hard for the Friday you skipped!"
<Page48>
Arihiko hurried out of the classroom.
He must have gone to the infirmary or something.
It seemed to be his turn to boycott class today.

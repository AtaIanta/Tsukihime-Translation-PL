<Page1>
"I'm home-"
I swallow the lump in my throat and enter the lobby.
<Page2>
...?
I'm not sure who, but I can hear talking in the living room.
It's just before dinner. One of the voices in the living room sounds odd.
Kohaku is probably in the kitchen, and I don't think Hisui is the one talking to Akiha.
<Page3>
"...I wonder if she's actually having tea with Kohaku."
Or does she have other guests?
In any case, I'll go to the living room to check...
<Page4>
Suddenly, Hisui comes out of the living room.
She heard my voice and came to greet me, but her expression seems strangely cloudy...?
<Page5>
"Sorry I'm late, but I'm back, Hisui."
"......."
Hisui looks at me with a blank expression.
There is no "welcome back" as usual.
<Page6>
"Umm... what's going on?
I don't know if it's my imagination, but you seem angry..."
<Page7>
"You have a visitor, Shiki-sama.
They have been waiting in the living room for a while now, so please hurry."
"A guest for me?"
"Yes," Hisui nods.
<Page8>
"...That's funny. There's no one who knows where to visit me. The only person who knows I've moved is Arihiko, and I haven't met anyone new recently-"
---No, wait.
I've got a really bad feeling about this.
<Page9>
"Hisui. What kind of person are they?"
"She is a beautiful woman with golden hair."
<Page10>
"---, Wh-"
Hisui's explanation is very straightforward.
I reflexively run into the demon's living room as quickly as I can.
<Page11>
"What the hell is going on---?!"
I open the door with all my might and go inside.
<Page12>
However, it was too late to do anything.
The situation has put a sharp twist in my life that will be impossible to recover from.
<Page13>
"Oh? ...Welcome home, Nii-san.
You are late again tonight, as is customary."
<Page14>
"Oh, you're back, finally. You made your sister and I wait for you, you're really arrogant."
<Page15>
They both look at me with opposite expressions.
I know it... I know this feeling.
I think it's the same hopeless feeling you often see in movies with soldiers being told, 'Beg for your life with a gun pressed to the back of your head.'"
<Page16>
"..."
So, I don't have the time to reply with a witty comeback.
<Page17>
Of all people, Arcueid and Akiha are facing each other.
Arcueid is unconcerned, and Akiha seems equally unconcerned, sitting on the sofa.
Although, unlike Arcueid's... relaxed attitude, Akiha's demeanor shows her hostility towards Arcueid.
<Page18>
Briefly, Akiha glances at me.
<Page19>
"What's the matter, Nii-san? Don't just stand there, please come over here and sit down."
<Page20>
Not a chance. I can't go near the sofa, as my intuition tells me I'll be stabbed as soon as I get close to it.
<Page21>
"H, here is fine.
More importantly, Akiha, this..."
<Page22>
...Well, how can I explain it?
There's no way I can say that we're just classmates at school, and saying that we met on the street would only add fuel to the fire.
<Page23>
"This, what?"
Akiha's relentless gaze pierces me.
<Page24>
Yeah, I feel like there's nothing I can say in this situation... but I have to come up with an excuse that won't damage anything... especially my own peace.
<Page25>
I can't let that happen- but in the first place, what kind of claim did this smiling vampire woman use to get into our house?
It's a little hard to imagine Akiha letting a complete stranger into the living room, isn't it?
<Page26>
"...First, let me ask you something.
What did this girl say to you?"
"Hmm?"
Arcueid tilts her head curiously.
<Page27>
"She is a friend of yours, is she not?
That is what she told me."
"Ah, right, she's a friend, a friend."
<Page28>
"I see. It would be nice if you could introduce me too.
If she is a friend of Nii-san, I can hardly just ask her to leave."
"Well, you see, Akiha..."
<Page29>
I start to slur my words.
"Well... friends, is it? Hmm..."
Then. As if she can't take it anymore after being ignored, Arcueid interrupts the conversation between the two siblings.
<Page30>
"After what you did to me, that's what you say? Gosh, my body still hurts as well."
"Wha-"
<Page31>
I'm dizzy.
Oh, so this is what the world calls dizziness.
I can't get enough of this feeling of drunkenness, of <departing|woosh> from reality at an incredible rate.
<Page32>
"What do you mean by that? Has Nii-san harmed you, physically or mentally?
I am sorry, but do you realize how vague your statements are?
<Page33>
"Yeah, it's perfect. Don't worry though, I'm over it. I got my body back now.
So, please don't mind me. I just came to ask Shiki out. We'll be gone in a minute. Isn't that right, Shiki?"
<Page34>
---This is bad.
If I let her talk any more, it will be the ruin of Tohno Shiki.
<Page35>
"Oh no, ahahahahaha!"
Laughing in desperation, I run to Arcueid, #grabbing her arm forcefully.
<Page36>
"Wait, Shiki, what are you doing?"
I can't afford to listen to her complaints.
I pull on Arcueid's arm and run out of the living room, leaving a stunned Akiha behind.
<Page37>
Hisui was waiting in the lobby.
I wonder what passes through her head as she sees me running with Arcueid in tow. Thinking about it might burn a hole in my stomach, so I'll try to ignore that right now.
<Page38>
"Going out, Shiki-sama?"
"Only reluctantly. I'm very sorry, but I need you to leave the front door unlocked."
"Yes, of course. Please, be very careful."
<Page39>
As Hisui bows condescendingly, I dash past her and run out of the house.

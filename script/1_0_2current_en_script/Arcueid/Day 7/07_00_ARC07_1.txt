I wake up in a daze.
The arm that stretched out over my glasses is faintly heavy.
Putting on my glasses, I'm thinking to myself, "Oh, I have a slight fever."
<Page2>
Even though my vision has returned to normal, I still feel mildly dizzy.
It resembles the symptoms of a cold, but this is a morning fever.
It's like putting a stuck engine on a flame to warm it up, and it will subside in time.
<Page3>
There is a knock on the door.
After a short wait.
<Page4>
"Excuse me."
I bowed and Hisui walked in.
<Page5>
"Good morning, Hisui. Thank you again for this morning."
"Good morning, Shiki-sama. I see you are awake."
<Page6>
"Oh. I slept very well last night. I'll go to the kitchen as soon as I get dressed.
...... I want you to tell Kohaku-san that I have a bit of a fever, so the dose should be lower."
<Page7>
"Understood.
...... Um, do you need a thermometer?"
"I don't need it. It's just the usual slight fever anyway."
<Page8>
"Then please change here. I'll be waiting for you in the kitchen."
Hisui bowed and left the room.
I don't know if it's because of my heart, but my bowing was a little less precise than usual.
<Page9>
"...... I wonder if she's worried about me. However, this kind of thing really happens all the time."
<Page10>
I appreciate the sentiment, but it's nothing to fuss about anymore.
The only thing that matters is what's inevitable.
I'm sure you can understand.
<Page11>
"...... But the duct tape doesn't really do it, does it? It made my blood boil whenever I saw it. If I see it next time..."
<Page12>
I was about to say that, but my words trailed off.
There is no "next time."
We'll never run into each other again.
There is no way I'm going to get involved with such a dangerous woman.
<Page13>
"...... Yes. Of course it's better."
I swallowed the obvious fact.
Today is Monday.
It is a good start to the week, just right for a fresh start.
<Page14>
I washed my face and got ready before entering the living room.
Akiha is sitting on the couch.
 It is just 7:00 a.m., but she already had breakfast and is enjoying a cup of tea.
<Page15>
"Oh, good morning, Nii-san. You're early this morning."
Akiha is in a good mood, probably pleased that I was up early.
"Good morning. Akiha is always early-"
<Page16>
...#I suddenly felt dizzy and pressed my eyes shut.
Still, the dizziness wouldn't go away.
I'm not sure if it's me, but my body temperature is going up...
<Page17>
"Nii-san ......?"
I heard the faint rustle of clothing and the sound of approaching footsteps.
<Page18>
"What's wrong? Your face is red, do you have a fever?"
"Oh, ......, no, I have a fever, sure, but...
<Page19>
Akiha approaches me without hesitation and peers at my face from below.
...... Funny.
For some reason, when I look at Akiha, I feel like I'm getting more and more giddy.
<Page20>
"...... You seem to have a bit of a fever.
Did you use your blanket properly last night? I'm sure you were just uncomfortable because of the changes in environment, but just in case.
Please wait here, Nii-san. I'll call Kohaku now, and we'll take your temperature before breakfast."
<Page21>
Akiha turns her gaze to the lobby. She is probably going to call Kohaku-san, who is preparing breakfast in the kitchen.
I take that opportunity to look away from Akiha.
...... After all, it was the only thing that made my dizziness go away.
<Page22>
"It's okay, Akiha, you don't need to call Kohaku-san.
I just woke up, and I'm just not feeling well, so don't worry about it..."
<Page23>
"I can't leave you alone, especially if you're not feeling well. What if it's just a cold? Even if it's a trivial illness, it must be a big deal to you. Your immunity and resistance are already lower than others.
<Page24>
Akiha put her hand on my forehead.
The touch of a cool, delicate palm makes my head tingle.
<Page25>
"......"
For a moment, I stopped breathing completely.
Akiha is right, there was something wrong with me this morning.
I'm not sure why, but I'm curious about Akiha's every movement.
Just watching the gestures raises my body temperature.
If I were to touch it directly, I would feel dizzy and could collapse.
<Page26>
"Nii-san ......? Um, isn't that pretty hot ......?"
I feel Akiha's voice echoing directly to my brain, not to my ears.
The beautiful black hair and white ceramic skin seem to flow directly into my head as if they were heat.
<Page27>
"It's ......."
This is bad.
This is just momentarily.
I'm just simply tired and my health is unstable.
<Page28>
So now, before I make a colossal mistake in front of Akiha.
"Okay, I just remembered something!"
I remove Akiha's hand and run like an escaping rabbit.
<Page29>
"Shiki-sama? Breakfast will be ready in about five minutes. ......"
"Well, thank you. Um, where's my bag?"
"If it's your bag, then here."
<Page30>
As expected of Hisui, she's well prepared.
I thanked Hisui and took the bag from her.
"I will get going. You don't have to see me off!"
<Page31>
"Please wait!  What are you doing even though you have a fever, Nii-san? #"What are you doing when you have such a fever? Please stay in the living room and take your temperature!"
<Page32>
Akiha is waiting for me in the lobby, probably trying to stop me.
But as I said, I just got into the lobby because I can't run in the hallway.
<Page33>
"Sorry, I'll follow the rules later!
 My fever's down and I'm going to school like this! I'll manage breakfast on my own, you'll just have to tolerate me this morning!"
<Page34>
"I'll take care of it. Hey, Nii-san!
 Wait a minute, what's with that statement? ......! A rule that you follow later is not a rule at all!"
<Page35>
I ran out of the front door to get away from Akiha's nitpicking.
I put my hands together and say sorry to Akiha in my heart.
<Page36>
I appreciate that you're worried about my health.
"No. In fact, I feel like I'm going to fall over from dizziness when I see you."
 There is no way I could say that, and I wonder what kind of repercussions awaited me if I did.
<Page37>
"Fuu."
Taking a deep breath, I finally calmed down.
It should be safe when I have come this far.
 Akiha wouldn't be so childish as to chase after her brother, who had run off to go to school.
<Page38>
"But it's typical of Akiha to be angry about the rules being broken."
I remembered what I said earlier and smile bitterly. 
 Even though she is my sister, I still don't know if her boiling point is low or high.
<Page39>
"I'm going to go...... and stop at a convenience store."
I don't have a lot of money in my wallet, but I'll take some light nourishment.
<Page40>
I resent the fact that I have an appetite on days like this.
Normally I wouldn't mind skipping breakfast, but I was just so hungry this morning.
I bought a loaf of bread to tide me over until lunch.

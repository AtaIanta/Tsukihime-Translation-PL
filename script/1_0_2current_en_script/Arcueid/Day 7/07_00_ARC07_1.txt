I wake up in a daze.
My arm stretched out over my glasses is faintly heavy.
Putting on my glasses, I thinking to myself, "Oh, I have a slight fever.
<Page2>
Even though my vision had returned to normal, I still felt mildly dizzy.
It resembled the symptoms of a cold, but this was a fever specific to the morning.
It's like putting a stuck engine on a flame to warm it up, and it will subside in time.
<Page3>
There was a knock on the door.
After a short wait.
<Page4>
"Excuse me."
I bowed and Hisui walked in.
<Page5>
"Good morning, Hisui. Thank you again for this morning."
"Good morning, Shiki-sama. I see you are awake."
<Page6>
"Oh. I slept very well last night. I'll go to the kitchen as soon as I get dressed.
...... I want you to tell Kohaku that I have a bit of a fever, so the dose is smaller."
<Page7>
"Very well, sir.
...... Um, do I need a thermometer?"
"I don't need it. It's just the usual slight fever anyway."
<Page8>
"Then change here. I'll be waiting for you in the kitchen."
Hisui bowed and left the room.
I don't know if it's because of my heart, but my bowing was a little less precise than usual.
<Page9>
"...... I wonder if she's worried about me. But this kind of thing really happens all the time."
<Page10>
I appreciate the sentiment, but it's nothing to fuss about anymore.
The only thing that matters is what's inevitable.
I'm sure you can understand.
<Page11>
"...... But the duct tape really doesn't do it, does it? It made my blood boil when I saw it. If I see it next time..."
<Page12>
He was about to say that, but his words trailed off.
There is no "next time."
We'll never run into each other again.
There was no way I'm going to get involved with such a dangerous woman.
<Page13>
"...... Yes. Of course it's better.
I swallowed the obvious fact.
Today is Monday.
It was a good start to the week, just right for a fresh start.
<Page14>
I washed my face and got ready before entering the living room.
Akiha was sitting on the couch.
 It was just 7:00 a.m., but they had already had breakfast and were enjoying a cup of tea.
<Page15>
"Oh, good morning, brother. You're early this morning."
Akiha was in a good mood, probably pleased that I was up early.
"Good morning. It's always early here.
<Page16>
...#I suddenly felt dizzy and pressed my eyes shut.
Still, the dizziness wouldn't go away.
I'm not sure if it's me, but my body temperature is going up...
<Page17>
"Brother ......?"
I heard the faint rustle of clothing and the sound of approaching footsteps.
<Page18>
"What's wrong? Your face is red, do you have a fever?"
"Oh, ......, no, I have a fever, sure, but...
<Page19>
Akiha approached me without hesitation and peered at my face from below.
...... Funny.
For some reason, when I look at Akiha, I feel like I'm getting more and more giddy.
<Page20>
"...... You seem to have a bit of a fever.
Did you use your blanket properly last night? I'm sure you were just upset because of the change in environment, but just in case.
Please wait there, brother. I'll call Kohaku now, and we'll take your temperature before breakfast."
<Page21>
Akiha turned her gaze to the lobby. She was probably going to call Kohaku, who was preparing breakfast in the kitchen.
I took that opportunity to look away from Akiha.
...... After all, it was the only thing that made my dizziness go away.
<Page22>
"It's okay, Akiha, I don't need to call Kohaku.
I just woke up and I'm not feeling well, so don't worry about it..."
<Page23>
"I can't leave him alone, especially if he's not feeling well. What if it's just a cold? What if it's just a cold? Even if it's a trivial illness, it must be important to you. His immunity and resistance are lower than others.
<Page24>
Akiha put her hand on my forehead.
The touch of a cool, delicate palm makes my head tingle.
<Page25>
"......"
For a moment, I stopped breathing completely.
Akiha was right, there was something wrong with me this morning.
I'm not sure why, but I'm curious about Akiha's every move.
Just watching the gesture raises my body temperature.
If he were to touch it directly, he would feel dizzy and could collapse.
<Page26>
"Brother ......? Um, isn't that pretty hot ......?"
I feel Akiha's voice echoing directly to my brain, not to my ears.
The beautiful black hair and white ceramic skin seemed to flow directly into my head as if it were heat.
<Page27>
"It's ......."
This is a bad idea.
This is just for now.
I'm simply tired and my health is unstabled.
<Page28>
So now, anyway, before I make a colossal mistake in front of Akiha.
"Okay, I just remembered something!"
He removed Akiha's hand and ran like an escaped rabbit.
<Page29>
"Mr. Shiki? Breakfast will be in about five minutes. ......"
"Well, thank you. Um, where's my bag?"
"Here's your bag, sir.
<Page30>
As expected of Hisui she's well prepared.
I thanked her and took the bag from Hisui
"I'm off. You don't have to see me off!"
<Page31>
"Wait for me! What are you doing with a fever, brother? #"What are you doing when you have a fever? Please stay in the living room and take your temperature!"
<Page32>
Akiha was waiting for me in the lobby, probably to stop me.
But as he said, he just got into the lobby for not being able to run in the hallway.
<Page33>
"Sorry, I'll follow the rules later!
 My fever's down and I'm going to school like this! I'll manage breakfast on my own, you'll just have to tolerate me this morning!"
<Page34>
"I'll take care of it. Hey, brother!
 Wait a minute, what's that statement? ......! A rule that you follow later is not a rule at all!"
<Page35>
I ran out the front door to get away from Akiha's nitpicking.
I put my hands together and said to Akiha, "I'm sorry in my heart.
<Page36>
I appreciate that you're worried about my health."
No. In fact, I feel like I'm going to fall over from dizziness when I see you.
 There was no way I could say that, and I wondered what kind of repercussions awaited me if I did.
<Page37>
"Breath."
Taking a deep breath, he finally calmed down.
It's safe to come this far.
 Akiha wouldn't be so childish as to chase after her brother, who had run off to go to school.
<Page38>
"But it's typical of Akiha to be angry about the rules being broken.
"But it's typical of Akiha to be angry about the rules being broken."
 Even though she is my sister, I still don't know if her emotional boiling point is low or high.
<Page39>
"I'm going to go...... and stop at a convenience store."
I don't have a lot of money in my wallet, but I'll take some light nourishment.
<Page40>
I resent the fact that I have an appetite on days like this.
Normally I wouldn't mind skipping breakfast, but this morning I was just so hungry.
I bought a loaf of bread to tide me over until lunch.

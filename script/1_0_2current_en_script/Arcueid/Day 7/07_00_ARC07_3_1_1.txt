...... After all, knowledge of vampires is necessary.
Parent vampires and the dead servants.
Let's hear about their relationships in details.
<Page2>
"hummm. don't just sober there, follow me."
"I'm sorry about that. The one who said everything was from the basic was you."
<Page3>
"Oh, as expected of the primates who build the pyramid using only human power! Solid and sincere.
Okay, so tonight let's talk about the intermediate vampire course, how the vampire society works!"
<Page4>
...... I don't really want to know much about it, but the one who requested it was me.
Let's quietly listen to professor Arcueid here.
<Page5>
"That being said. its too long to talk starting from the occurence, so I'll limit the story to our enemy. the dead ancestors.
most of them are old fashioned vampires, and their reproduction…… The way they breed is to suck blood and increase their companions.
Do I still really need to explain this anymore?"
<Page6>
"Aa. The owner and his servant.
One ruler and many worker ants was it?"
<Page7>
"Yes. and there are types of these worker ants.
As I said before, this is a kind of ladder.
<Page8>
"First, level one, The Corpse.
A puppet that cannot stand on its own and moves according to the instructions of its parents. If there is no order, it will be left as a corpse and will die.
A low ranking soldier in short. Things that just sucked blood and sent blood. One of what we call the dead."
<Page9>
"Next, The Second level, The Ghoul.
A dead person who has a will but cannot think clearly and mimicing the form it had in life.
Although they don't decompose due to their parent's magical power, their insides have completely collapsed.
And since his brain is rotten, he instinctively seeks blood and flesh, so he is more ferocious than the "corpse" on the first floor. If I dare to say it, it would be a soldier. But then this is also a dead."
<Page10>
"Third level, The Undead.
I wonder if it will finally become a creature that can be called a vampire from here.
A living corpse. Undead. Although he does not have the thinking ability of his life, he can disguise his humanlife by himself.
A senior soldier who died and had been reconstructed. Sunlight is fine too. However, antiseptic/preservative treatment must be done diligently, or its identity will be revealed easily.
This is the end of the category called the dead"
<Page11>
……So that's it.
That zombie ... Did the dead have such a stage?
The more the steps go, the more the corpse will improve from just a corpse to a moving corpse.
by the way,
<Page12>
"Regardless of the rank, Are you the one who named the dead and the corpse?"
<Page13>
"Sorry to dissappoint you, But this is usually the job of the holy church. We're just using it since it's convinient, And it just became a common word in the mage's world.
The problem is who is the one inside the church who spreads this. but well it doesn't matter"
<Page14>
"Next is the fourth level, Nightkin.
An immortal who acts as a vampire apprentice while maintaining his personality
Instead of having physical abilities that are far from humans, he feels extreme coldness and thirst. So to speak, a low-ranking knight, a half-serving vampire."
<Page15>
"Victims start with vampires on this level as things above the level six carefully suck their prey little by little. It becomes anemic when exposed to sunlight, but it has not been burned yet.
In the magical world, it is only up to this level that one can still be called "human"
<Page16>
"Vampire apprentice ... In other words, its not "dead" anymore?"
"Yes. A vampire who has reached the IV level can live even if he is away from his parent. From the perspective of the parent, it seems like it's changed from a thing to a living thing.
Only one in a thousand people can become a level four"
<Page17>
"Next is level five, Night Demon.
fourth level In addition to the depth of the rankings, the curse in the blood makes it possible to exert different abilities caused by the parent group or the individual.
Senior knight, a full-fledged vampire"
<Page18>
"And, the last sixth level. Lesser Dead Appostle.
Completely independent as a "blood-sucking species". You can make children by sucking blood and eroding, but you can't make any children above this level.
It's the limit of the upstart. If you dare to say it, it ’s a citadel.
The vampires nesting in this city are on this level. It ’s a disaster that makes a servant as a “parent” and preys on the village."
<Page19>
"The above is the identification system for the dead. Is there anything you care about?"
"Which level was Vlov?"
"Of course, VI, the Lesser Dead Appostle. In his case, I jumped from there, but at another time"
<Page20>
"Then another one. This is the main subject.
I said the social division system, but who decides it ... no, what decides it? If a vampire sucks blood and increases the number of friends, why is it so different?"
<Page21>
"You really did notice a good point.
That's the biggest drawback of the dead ... No, it's a feature.
Not everyone who is sucked by the dead apostle becomes a vampire, and the dead apostle does not make anyone a vampire."
<Page22>
"Making servants and eating are different
If its just sucking blood, humans will die as humans.
However, at that time, when the blood of the dead is sent, the body of the human will be dominated and die. Afterwards it would be reborn as a vampire and cursed.
This level represents the depth of the curse."
<Page23>
...... Then, the man just before wasn't revived after being killed ... # Was he killed by the "parent group" to make him a vampire from the beginning?"
<Page24>
"Yes. But it's not easy to make a servant. Vampires can't easily increase a family
If you're a level one corpse, you can send blood after killing and make it a soldier.
However, in order to increase the number of level two vampires and above, the victims' own talents ... #Aptitude is needed."
<Page25>
"Aptitude ……? What aptitude?"
"Immunity against the blood of blood-sucking species?"
<Page26>
"Most humans don't have the aptitude for it. Therefore, when the blood of a vampire is sent in, it is easy to be dominated by the characteristics of the vampire. It ’s like an illness that keeps you working after you die.
However that doesn't call me as a good servant. As a parent I'd be in trouble if I don't have my own strength.If you spend your time every time you move a worker ant, that's the end of the story, right?"
<Page27>
That's right
Parent Vampires usually sleeps in a coffin
Vampires who have lived for a long time have poor fuel economy. So it doesn't move often and requires limbs to collect blood  energy without having to do anything.
its a different story if you consume your power every time you move your limbs.
<Page28>
"Humans with aptitude can resist the curse of the vampire.
After that, it's the viability of the person. Will you lose the blood of a vampire and die, or will you overcome this and reborn as a vampire?
The corpse found in this city is a human who was aptitude but died as it was.
The result is just a "killed" corpse left on the street. The dead will start moving on their own after being killed, but the bodies that couldn't be dead remain, right?"
<Page29>
"……I see. If you become that zombie, you won't have any bodies left."
"That kind of thing. The victims in the news are rather rare cases. He was noticed because he had the same aptitude, and as a result he died as a human."
<Page30>
"About one in a hundred people has aptitude. Among them, only those who can adapt to the foreign matter sent in to the body can endure becoming vampires above the level 4.
Vampires are often said to be murine lectures, but not everyone can be a child by sending blood. Actually, the number of things that can be called "vampires" is decreasing with the times."
<Page31>
"……………"
Its not easy to grow a family. Arcueid said
For vampires, "subordinates" and "children" are probably be different.
The dead that Arcueid finished earlier is just nothing more that a "subordinate" who just moves.
<Page32>
"So, did the man just killed a long time ago and work as the vampire said without even knowing it?"
<Page33>
"even I don't know, It depends on the level.
level one might be nothing more than a moving doll, but in level three, the brain is alive. They follow the Vampires, Understanding what they have become. I'm willing to kill humans and send blood to my parents (I should probably put "or so" since it says "親基に血を送っているのよ")."
<Page34>
"...... No, that's not the case"
I was killed suddenly, and when I realized it, I was made into a moving corpse. That's why it's decided to be forced"
<Page35>
"...... I already saw that before, the dead who begged for life like that
'If you go against it, you will be killed' 'I was just ordered to do it'
In other words, you're killing humans because you don't want to die. What is the difference between this and being willing to kill yourself?"
<Page36>
"―――――― No, that is"
"The unconscious dead always complain that they have no freedom and that they have no choice but to do this.
But the freedom to die against the Lord remains. But I chose to kill humans, so I think they're willing to kill their former relatives, Human  Ikimono(its written in kana "イキモノ" so I'm not entirely sure about this one)."
<Page37>
"Well, in any case, I don't care because I'm going to kill all the things that are connected to the dead."
<Page38>
"………………"
...... There are no words.
Arcueid's argument is correct. It makes sense.
But that's the vampire's ... strong creature reasoning.
Humans cannot live that well, nor can they live simply.
<Page39>
"And one more thing. Even servants can go againsts its parent.
Vampires that are called dead apostle gives their servants a free will. Someday, go against yourself and challenge yourself. Volvo is also a vampire who killed his parents and became a dead apostle."
<Page40>
"Very well, remember Shiki.
Vampires who are classified as dead apostle, love humans
No, I love human things. So you can be cruel as much as you want. Human  You are the best on this planet ... because you are are the only creatures that can consume their lives to afflict"
<Page41>
...... Human thing. intelligence, or is it emotion?
Arcueid said
Humans cannot understand the death of minerals.
And similarly, minerals and animals can't understand human death.
Is emotional death and mental suffering an entertainment only for people?
<Page42>
"Do you mean to leave freedom to suffer?
I can't understand. Why would vampires do that? It too wasteful. That hobby is too horrible"
<Page43>
"That's right. I admit it, that vampires are a bad hobby
But that's only for the dead apostle. Those that were blood-sucking species from the beginning do not do that much"
"――――？"
What was a vampire from the beginning……？
<Page44>
"...... By the way, I said that there are two types of vampires.
Those who are vampires from the beginning and those who have become vampires from humans
Are those guys who "became vampire from humans" are the dead apostle?
<Page45>
"...... Well, that's right
Some have become immortal at the end of magic, while there are others who became a servant after being sucked by true ancestors."
<Page46>
"....Shiki, you said that its a bad hobby to use the human you killed earlier. But you're still better off. Because other dead apostle devise more despisable plays.
Playing --- Do you mean that you kill humans by playing and use the corpse as a toy ...?"
<Page47>
"...... I won't deny it
Entertainment is the same as breathing for the dead apostles
Despite being a short-lived human being, being "Bored" was their greatest enemy when they are approaching Immortality, Albeit imperfectly.
Unlike us, They became immortal due to their meaningless habits, And they lose all their desires the moment they got immortality.
Since the purpose was immortality, it would be unavoidable to say that it can't be helped."
<Page48>
".....what's that. Don't say such things that you want to play because you're bored.
Generally speaking, if you don't get old and die. Then isn't that enough?. What other fun do you need."
<Page49>
"That's whay its already enough for them.
But that doesn't mean anything.
An intelligent body that recognizes itself as worthless --- a stopped life loses its value there."
<Page50>
"Fearing themselves as they gradually wear out, they are willing to make entertainment. Defend yourself that you are alive and that you still have fun. That is the beginning of the aristocrat"
<Page51>
"They started a game that imitated humans and expanded their power by making themselves look like a castle owner#.
It's a kingdom of the dead, to say the least. Unexpectedly, it seems to have been exciting for them"
<Page52>
Did you say that? They are imitating humans
The dead give their blood to the humans they sucked and killed for entertainment
The corpse grows through one in a thousand of chance, And eventually killing its parents and becoming a new dead apostle.
<Page53>
"A knight becomes a monarch with a martial art.
Like to knock down the king soon --- they can't exist without such a game.
The lightness of the existence of devilish things, probably.
Even if it is immortal, it is no different from air if it has no meaning."
<Page54>
It looks like an idiot, Arcueid shrugs
Arcueid should be one of them, but he doesn't seem to have that kind of taste.

I'm not sleepy yet, but my body seems to need a break.
A lot has happened today.
In a way, I've been swamped by this girl all evening.
<Page2>
"...... Well, I should probably get going."
"Well, you're right. You're tired #and you've got your sister's scary eyes on you, right?"
"I'm not afraid of that."
<Page3>
I'm simply shelving the problem.
Be that as it may.
<Page4>
"So, what are your plans for tomorrow? Where do you want to meet?"
"Here's fine. I'll meet you here at 10:00. Don't forget to bring your knife."
<Page5>
No need to tell me that.
I would never use something like karate to hunt for vampires.
<Page6>
"But 10:00......."
The lights go out after 9:30 and 10:00 is when the house is closed to the public.
It would be hard to go out without Hisui and Kohaku-san watching.
I was about to suggest at least eleven o'clock, but then I decided it was okay and swallowed my words.
<Page7>
Nights seem long, but they are short.
The more time we have to explore together, the better.
<Page8>
"Great. See you later, Shiki.
I'll see you here tomorrow."
<Page9>
"――――――"
What a troublesome day I've had.
The white vampire said goodbye in the calmest tone possible and left.
<Page10>
"......What is it? You can do it!"
I tried to complain and so on to cover up the emotions that came up in my chest.
......Damn it.
If you see a smile like that, you might not even be able to forget your promise.

Let's go around the city without giving up.
In the first place, we met by chance.
There is no natural relationship like "we can meet if I go there".
If I don't want to rely on coincidence, I need to mobilize all my intuition and feet to find that mysterious white back.
<Page2>
"......That' s right. That's what going out to meet people is all about. I've been relying on my phone too much."
<Page3>
When mobile devices were not yet widely used.
Even if you passed someone at a meeting place, you could find them by yourself if you considered their lifestyle and way of thinking.
It was not a 'wild intuition', but a natural human ability. Even today, when we are used to cell phones, there is nothing we can't do without them.
<Page4>
......but my range of operation is small.
I should probably target either a residential area or a downtown area.
<Page5>
"............Okay."
I gave it some thought and decided on the downtown area.
While alternately monitoring the north and south exits of Souya Station, I shall extend my visit to the downtown area.
<Page6>
No matter how crowded the place is, if she's still in this city---if that back of her is still there, I won't miss her.
<Page7>
"No, not at all."
I didn't have any wild intuition or anything.
Maybe I'll find her soon? I had a feeling.
Maybe she'll be in front of this station next time! I couldn't find her like that, either.
I was completely lost.
<Page8>
It's been a long time since I had such a clean waste of time and energy. It may be an overstatement, but it can even be the first time.
Because I never know when anemia will strike, I tried not to take any "useless actions".
<Page9>
......When I think about it, I wonder why I made such an unreasonable choice
I wonder if I made a baseless choice that "I might be able to find her".
<Page10>
"But the night is just beginning.
Just a little more exploring..."
<Page11>
I got a call on my cell phone.
I wondered who it was, was it Arihiko? I took it out and found that it was ......
<Page12>
"Shiki-san.
Please hurry back to the mansion.
Because we have a surprise visitor."
<Page13>
『A very nice foreign woman who claimed to be "Shiki's girlfriend" and
I'll also be calling Akiba-sama, who was not only unhappy about the morning incident but also about Shiki-sama not returning.
What's in your heart?』
<Page14>
It was a mysterious email from Kohaku-san.
"―――#What the...?"
My mind went blank.
So...... Arcueid is now in Tohno's mansion?
My thoughts can easily comprehended the worst, but now refuse to comprehend it.
<Page15>
I was naive. I was really naive.
 Why did I think that I could predict Arcueid's actions based on common sense?
<Page16>
"It makes too much sense even for that! #I run to the Tono residence with the speed of a rabbit."
<Page17>
It's scary to even imagine what kind of comments Arcueid is making.
And I'm already dying just imagining what Akiha will think when she hears it. ......!
<Page18>
Okay, I've broken my best record.
I ran through the heart-breaking slope and arrived at the Tono residence out of breath.
However, 
<Page19>
"............gulp"
The breathing that had been disrupted by running at full speed calmed down.
My shoulders, which had been moving up and down violently, became quiet.
<Page20>
As it should be, the Tohno residence now had an intimidating feel to it, as if it were the introduction to a horror movie.
I mean...
<Page21>
"Well, just in time.
Are you ready for this, Nii-san?"
<Page22>
......Oh no.
I didn't know humans could be forced to prepare for death so easily......?
<Page23>
But there was no way out for me, as a brother.
The situation can only get worse if I remain in fear.
I made up my mind and rushed into the evil Western-style house.
<Page24>
"It seems you are finally home.
.......If you had been a minute later, I do not know what would have happened."

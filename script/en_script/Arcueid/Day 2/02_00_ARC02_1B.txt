In the living room, I saw Akiha and Hisui.
Akiha's uniform is from a famous school for young ladies called Asagami Academy.
<Page2>
"Yo. Morning, Akiha.
"Good morning, Nii-san.
It seems that you woke up late this morning..... Well, that's okay. I'll just say that you didn't sleep well on your first day."
<Page3>
"............"
The word "blunt" comes to mind.
I swallowed the words, "I was actually up earlier than usual," and sat down on the sofa.
<Page4>
"Hisui. A cup of tea for Nii-san.
I'll have another cup, too."
"Very well. Shiki-sama, would you like some sugar?
"Ah, yes. Just one spoon then."
<Page5>
And so, the awkward morning hours began.
"……………"
"……………"
Hisui put the teacup on the table and went back to the wall to wait.
I silently took a sip of the dark red tea and... #wait, what is this taste ......?
<Page6>
"It's so delicious .......
It's bitter yet sweet, complex yet cleansing on the throat, and it smells just like Christmas ......!"
<Page7>
I don't know what I'm saying, but that's how shocked I was.
I had learned last night of the grandeur of the Tohno residence, and this tea was no exception.
<Page8>
"This morning, it's Esprit de Noel from Mariage.
The most famous tea stores are in England, but this is from France. It was founded around 1850 and only recently landed in Japan about 15 years ago ......, so it's not a major brand, but the quality is good.
<Page9>
" Fufu.....The expression Christmas is so vague but strangely enough, it conveys the nuance.
I'm not sure if my expression was too funny, but Akiha was smiling with pride.
<Page10>
"I hear the price is fair, and it was worth it to try and match my plebian brother. Did you learn that a fine leaf is worth it's weight in gold?"
<Page11>
It was a dominant, superior look at the poor primates.
Even her gesture of placing the teacup on the saucer was elegant.
<Page12>
"Tch......."
But, unfortunately, she's right.
This tea is the real deal... What was the tea I've been drinking in the afternoon until now? I mean, you could certainly start a business or two with this. If such a thing existed in a time period where entertainment was scarce, even I would be ordering this in desperation.
<Page13>
Then, about 10 minutes passed by.
"..............."
Both me and Akiha just enjoyed tea and did not have any more conversation.
This was the result of my repeated gazing at the teacup, but not being able to think of a topic.
To be honest, it was awkward to say the least.
<Page14>
Still, it wasn't a bad time for me.
It's not something I can say from the standpoint of having been left alone until now, but just seeing Akiha spending her time like this in peace gives me an indescribable feeling.
I wonder if this is a relief ....... I can't help but be happy that Akiha is in front of me right now, no matter what.
<Page15>
While I was immersed in this small sense of satisfaction, I heard a strange sound coming from the hallway.
<Page16>
"Bigger the family, bigger the love!
Chaotic, rude, and finally, insane.
Stampede to the hell!! "
Through the wall, a tempoless humming approches.
<Page17>
"Haaay, gummoneen!
Gooood morning to Owner chaaan too"
<Page18>
The person who opened the door boldly and came in was dressed as wildly as her absurd appearance.
<Page19>
She was dressed in an overcoat that was almost underwear and a tight leather skirt.
Her unusually long hairs were pulled up in a way that didn't make sense.
She seemed to have no makeup, but her lips were strangely glossy.
Her hair is reddish blonde, and she is tall, so she looks like a foreigner.
<Page20>
As far as I can see from her open chest and waist, she has an excellent figure.
The woman who arrived was a "mature woman" in her own right, and would be more at home lying on a beach in the middle of summer than in an anachronistic western-style house like this.
...... Well, if it weren't for the oddly fitting lab coat.
<Page21>
"...... Good morning, Dr. Arach.
What can I do for you today? I thought the regular checkup was yesterday."
<Page22>
"No, I wasn't in the mood for it yesterday."
When I was watching the sunset, I got frustrated, so I abandoned my research and ran out to the city. Well, frankly speaking, I skipped work. So, I came here in the morning to get some work done today!
Oh, maid-chan, please give me some tea. Four or five spoonfuls of sugar, or six if you feel like it?
<Page23>
The woman in white coat strolled into the living room.
Naturally, her eyes met mine as she sat down on the sofa.
<Page24>
"Oh?? Oho????
Oh? Hmmm? Mmmmmmmmm?"
<Page25>
She was staring at me.
After taking her time to observer, the woman looked satisfied. #The woman smiled, and then...
<Page26>
"Hi---hi, hi-hi-hi-hi!
It's too good to be true!
What's this, the master has come up with a plan to kill me with laughter? That's great, dead mast and all the A-10!
Oh, my God, it's like Macbeth in the house! You're so ready to kill or be killed, you're so ready for tragedy!"
<Page27>
The woman is laughing from her stomach.
"..............."
I can only frown.
What's with this high-spirited person? Akiha called her doctor, but .......
<Page28>
"Dr. Arach.
May I introduce you to Nii-san?"
As if she couldn't stand the sight of me being left behind, Akiha cleared her throat and chided the woman in white.
<Page29>
"Hmm? Is it me you're talking about? Or Shiki-chan?
Leave it, there's no point.
I've heard about Shiki-chan from Makihisa-kun.
Shiki-chan is not interested in the affairs of a stranger like me, right?
<Page30>
Makihisa-kun.....?
So, is this woman an acquaintance of my father?
<Page31>
"Yes, I've always been a carefree woman, like a webless spider drifting in the wind, 
but I had a chance to meet Makihisa-kun.
"If you have nowhere else to go, why don't you come live with us?"
He was so cool about it!
But alas, Makihisa is not reaaaaaaally my type, so I simply turned him down, and now I'm friends with the head of the family?
Do you think it's possible?"
<Page32>
I look at Akiha.
...... It takes a lot of courage to talk to this woman.
<Page33>
"Yes. Dr. Arach was father's junior at the university.
Now, as father's friend, she is my advisor."
<Page34>
"Whaaat? I don't like it when you call me that.
Pro fes sor. I'll cry if you don't call me Professor Arach with love and affection!"
<Page35>
Instead of crying, Dr. Arach smiled and laughed.
...... But
She smiles, but her eyes are fixed on my face like a sticky thread, as they have been ever since she came into this room.
<Page36>
"Arach-sama. The tea is ready."
<Page37>
Hisui intervened.
Not reading the atmosphere...... No, it seems that Hisui's attitude of not being influenced by the atmosphere of the place neutralized the tension created by Arach.
<Page38>
"Oof. You really are the epitome of a maid."
...... She's sulking because she was interrupted.
With one hand on her hip, she drinks the sugar-filled tea in one gulp with the gutso of a sports drink.
<Page39>
Gulp! "Ohh, nice sugar! It's flowing all through my organs, melting away my uterus and ovaries while making them race with excitement."
<Page40>
"I'm off for a routine checkup! There's something wrong with the air conditioning in the bathrooms, isn't there? I know, I know, I know. I'll just do a quick check and add some ion clusters or something.
<Page41>
With a high-pitched laugh, Arach crossed the living room and headed for the hallway. .......
As she touched the doorknob, the woman turned to me and said, 
<Page42>
"Nice to meet you, Shiki-chan. How about getting along with each other?
A lot is going to happen now, but...
If you really can't do anything about it anymore, how about you come and talk to me?"
<Page43>
The visitor walked away, humming the same tune as when she had arrived.
"……………"
"……………"
An inexpressible silence envelops the living room.
<Page44>
"Hey, Akiha."
"I don't know much about Dr. Arach either.
but due to father's will, she is in charge of the maintenance and management of the main building. I heard that father was a very good architect. But it seems that the construction industry was a side business."
<Page45>
Akiha assured me firmly.
"What's with that woman?" I was the first to ask.
"I'm not going to take any more questions," she said.
<Page46>
"If you'll excuse me. Akiha-sama, it's time for you to go to school.......
Hmm? There's a tense atmosphere here.
Haha. Did you already frighten Shiki-san by saying something unreasonable in the morning?"
<Page47>
"You. What do you mean by "already"?
First, I don't talk about unreasonable things. I'm just asking for common sense."
<Page48>
Kohaku-san was impressed by Akiha's statement.
It's only the second day, but I think I'm starting to understand the relationship between these two people.
<Page49>
"I'll head to school then.
Nii-san. As I said last night, curfew is strictly enforced. Did you see the news last night?"
"No, I haven't. Someone took my cell phone. Unreasonably so."
<Page50>
"I see. Then I'll have the morning paper ready in the living room tomorrow.
You might want to get up early and read through the day's news.
<Page51>
There you have it.
It was an ironclad attitude that bounced back my little sarcasm in no time at all.
<Page52>
"According to the news, the body of a vagrant was found at the north exit of Souya Station last night. It's being reported that he froze to death due to malnutrition or died of exhaustion due to blood loss."
<Page53>
"Whatever the truth is, it seems that the downtown area is not safe these days. It would be a disgrace to the Tohno family if we were to get involved in a trivial incident while out at such a time.
As soon as school is over, please try to get back to the house before the sun goes down."
<Page54>
After reminding me of the curfew, Akiha left the living room.
But ... before the sun goes down means you have to be back by six o'clock. Wasn't the curfew of eight o'clock?

Let's take a detour and go home.

I don't want to go home...... It's not so bad, but I need some more time to get used to that luxurious house.
Maybe I'll visit Arihiko's house, or maybe I'll stop by the bookstore in the station building.
No matter what I do, I should be able to make it in time for the house's curfew with an hour-long detour.

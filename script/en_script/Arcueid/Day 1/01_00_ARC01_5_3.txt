Before that, I want to look around the hall a little more.
Even though it used to be my home, my feelings seem to be buoyed by the sight of such a grand mansion.
<Page2>
"Excuse me. Before we go to the living room, do you mind if we take a look around the other rooms? It's kind of nostalgic."
There used to be a playroom on the second floor of the west wing...
<Page3>
"Oh my. So you remember it."
<Page4>
"But I'm sorry.
The large rooms such as the playroom, the library, and the salon have been locked since Akiha-sama became the head of the family.
Even if you're the eldest son, you're not allowed to use these rooms without permission from her."
<Page5>
"Oh... I see. That's too bad."
She refuses me flatly, and I helplessly sweep my gaze away.
<Page6>
"I can't explore so freely after all, can I?"
"No, but I'm sure she'll forgive you as soon as you've greeted her.
Oh, but..."
<Page7>
"When you enter a room that is locked, it would be helpful if you could say something to us.
The Tohno residence has strict security not only on the outside but also on the inside. If you enter an unauthorized room, we cannot guarantee your safety."
<Page8>
"I can't guarantee it," she repeats. Are there going to be arrows flying at me?
<Page9>
"No,
More terrifying than arrows would be the thunder of our strict master.
The servant smiles jokingly and urges me to go down the corridor.
I guess she wants me to go to the living room to rest first.
<Page10>
"Welcome back, Shiki-sama.
I look forward to working for you."

I can't reply to her polite greeting, so I follow her without hesitation.

Before that, I wanted to look around the hall a little more.
Even though it used to be my home, my feelings seemed to be buoyed by the sight of such a grand mansion.
<Page2>
"Excuse me. Before we go to the living room, do you mind if we take a look around the other rooms? It's kind of nostalgic."
There used to be a playroom on the second floor of the west wing...
<Page3>
"Oh my. So you remember it."
<Page4>
"But I'm sorry.
The large rooms such as the playroom, the library, and the salon have been locked since Akiha-sama became the head of the family.
Even if you're the eldest son you're not allowed to use these rooms without permission from Akiha-sama."

"Oh... I see. That's too bad."
She refused me flatly, and I helplessly swept my gaze away.
<Page6>
"I can't explore so freely after all, can I?"
"No, but I'm sure she'll forgive you as soon as you've greeted her.
Oh, but..."
<Page7>
"When you enter a room that is locked, it would be helpful if you could say something to us.
The Tohno residence has strict security not only on the outside but also on the inside. If you enter an unauthorized room, we cannot guarantee your safety."
<Page8>
"I can't guarantee it," she exaggerated again. Are there going to be arrows flying at me?
<Page9>
"No,
More terrifying than arrows would be the thunder of our strict master.
The servant smiled jokingly and urged me to go down the corridor.
I guess she wanted me to go to the living room to rest first.
<Page10>
"Welcome back, Shiki-sama.
I look forward to working for you."

I couldn't reply to her polite greeting, so I followed her without hesitation.

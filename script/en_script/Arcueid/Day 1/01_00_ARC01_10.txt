　---Suddenly, I woke up.
<Page2>
　No one woke me up.
　I didn't hear anything.
　I can't remember the last time I woke up in the middle of sleep without any reason.
<Page3>
　Feeling like I've forgetten something, I sit up restlessly.
<Page4>
　 My heart pounding, I leaves the room, curious about what's going on outside.
<Page5>
　I'm thirsty, so I go down the hallway in search of water.
<Page6>
　A long, moonlit corridor.
　The sounds of the night when the inhabitants are sleeping.
　I've ...... missed it.
　I'm sure I've walked along this path in the past.
　I mindlessly wander down the staircase.
<Page7>
　The stairs are a blind spot in the mansion
　Not only do they connect the first floor and the second floor, but on the back side of them, there is a secret passage that leads to the attic.
<Page8>
　It has long since been forgotten, even by the residents.
 The attic of the mansion, once used as a warehouse, has not been accessed by anyone for several years.
<Page9>
　It's only October, but tonight it's as cold as the middle of winter.
　I search through my luggage for a blanket.
 An dresser catches my eye, so I open one of its drawers.
<Page10>
"'------'
　All that's inside are insignificant knickknacks.
　The drawer was a mess.
<Page11>
  I feel disappointed, as if I had opened a treasure chest and only found a few pebbles scattered inside.
  There were badges, accessories, binoculars, and other miscellaneous items collected by children lying around.
  Among them, only one thing clearly stands out.
<Page12>
　It is a dirty bandage stored in a transparent plastic case.
　It's neatly rolled up, but it's too old to be of any use.
　There's nothing here.
　Closing the drawer, I decide to go back to my room.
<Page13>
　On my way out of the room.
　For no apparent reason, I found that my cheeks were wet.
　Maybe...
　Maybe I used this place when I was a kid.

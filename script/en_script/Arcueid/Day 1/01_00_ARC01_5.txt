<Page1>
The main gate was tightly closed.
As a child, I had only thought of it as a large house, but after living with the Arima family, I realized how huge it really was.
<Page2>
The entire plateau overlooking the city is managed by the Tohno family.
The site is larger than our high school, and if you include the forest that spreads out behind it, it's probably three times as big.
<Page3>
The grounds are surrounded by a long wall and trees, making it impossible to see inside.
The main gate, which is the entrance to the property, is closed as if to deny anyone from coming in.
<Page4>
Next to the gate for cars, there is a doorway for humans.
After a moment of hesitation, I pressed the button that seemed to be the doorbell.
<Page5>
There was no ringing sound to be heard by the person who pressed the button, as in a normal intercom.
After a few seconds of waiting, the doorway unlocked with a mechanical sound that said, "Please come in."
<Page6>
"...The door here is now fully automatic. There used to be a guard..."
<Page7>
I opened the heavy door and entered the premises, passing through the stone gate.
The doors locked tightly with a crisp sound behind me.
<Page8>
After passing through the main gate, a gently sloping path led deeper into the forest.
Surrounded by tall trees, the path reminded me of a tunnel.
It went straight to the east, and after about 40 meters, it turned at a right angle to the north.
<Page9>
"------"
With each step, memories come flooding back, as if being colored in. 
I know this road.
I have run along this road many times.
<Page10>
Almost there.
If you arrive at that corner and turn your feet to the north, on the left, you will find,
<Page11>
The Tohno mansion, towering like a chalk wall.
Oh. I let out a sigh that could be described as admiration or resignation.
<Page12>
The mansion has not changed at all since then.
According to my father, the house was heavily renovated after the war, but the basic structure was inherited from my grandfather's and his grandfather's generation.
<Page13>
This is the castle of a powerful family who has been in this land for more than hundreds of years.
For Makihisa ...... and the people of Tohno, this mansion is a sanctuary itself.
<Page14>
I remember at the annual family reunion, many adults would try to get my father to rent them a corner of the mansion.
<Page15>
They were probably successful businessmen with their own mansions, but for some reason they were obsessed with living here.
For them, living in this land must have been greatly prestigious.
...Really, it's ridiculous. As privelged as it sounds, for me it's just a "big house".
<Page16>
"...............Well."
There was no turning back now that I had come this far.
There is an incongruous doorbell next to the double swinging door.
<Page17>
I shook off my nervousness and pushed the doorbell.
There is no familiar ping-pong sound.
<Page18>
The heavy silence continued for a few seconds.
I hear the sound of hurried footsteps coming from the other side of the door.
<Page19>
"Yes, I've been waiting for you."
Despite its heavy appearance, the door was opened lightly.
<Page20>
I squinted at the slanting sunlight streaming in through the window.
I had prepared for this, but I still gasped and looked around the vast lobby.
<Page21>
...It is an architectural beauty that overwhelms the visitor.
I felt as if I had been transported to a different country, a different time. The interior of the mansion was so dated that even the atmosphere was different.
<Page22>
Still, I was in the familiar lobby of the Tohno residence.
<Page23>
As I stood there, a girl in anachronistic clothing greeted me.
<Page24>
"Thank goodness. I was worried that you might be lost since you were so late.
If you hadn't made it here the sun went down, we would have come to get you."
The girl in the kimono and apron smiled and laughed.
<Page25>
"Ah, no..."
I was so bewildered by this unexpected turn of events that I couldn't speak coherently.
I had assumed that the person who greeted me would be the rugged-looking butler who was also Makihisa's secretary.
<Page26>
"?"
The girl tilted her head gently, as if puzzled by my confused attitude. 
<Page27>
"You are Shiki-sama, right?"
"Y-yes. Although, 'sama' is a bit excessive."
<Page28>
"You are, aren't you? Please don't scare like that again.
I was afraid I made a mistake."
<Page29>
The girl in the apron pressed her forefinger to her lips with a "meh" gesture, as if she were a mother scolding her child.
Apparently, she was seriously worried and angry. Even so, the smile remains on her face and the girl remains her warm composure.
<Page30>
...kimono and apron.
She comes to greet me like this and calls me "sama".
So, this girl is-
<Page31>
"Excuse me. Are you a servant here by any chance?"
"------"
The girl answered my question with only a smile.
<Page32>
"You must be tired, right?
Please don't hesitate to come in. Make yourself at home in the living room until Akiha-sama is ready.
<Page33>
The girl walked slowly, as if she was leading me.
She walked towards the corridor on the east side of the lobby, next to the grand staircase.
<Page34>
I believe the living room was just inside that hallway.
I...
C:>decide to obediently follow her.
C:>decide to stop the girl and ask for her name.
C:>...well, I think I'll explore the mansion a little.

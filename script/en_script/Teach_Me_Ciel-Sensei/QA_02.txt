Welcome To My Territory.
Welcome, you wretched bad boy.
<Page2>
If you make a choice while naively thinking,

Good afternoon to those who have returned.
And for new-comers, nice to meet you too.

I am Ciel, the instructor of this Q&A corner.
And here with me is my assistant(sandbag) Neco-Arc.

Each lesson, I will briefly explain the cause of the dead end,
so I hope you will stay until the end.
<Page8>
Usually the last choice you made was a bad one,

<Page11>
When faced with an unusual situation, it is a good idea to cautiously observe...
but this time it was not the right call.
<Page12>
After all, there was no way to escape.
<Page13>
Unless you can fly,
I would not recommend taking up position on the roof of the hotel.
<Page14>
He could have escaped if he had been a cat.
Cats can fly in the air very lightly, you know.
<Page15>
? When you say 'lightly', what do you mean?
Like from roof to roof?
<Page16>
But even for a cat,
flying from the top floor of a hotel is a bit...
<Page17>
She pulled out a rocket and flew...!

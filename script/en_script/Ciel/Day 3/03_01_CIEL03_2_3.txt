That's right, let's go to the tea ceremony room.
I heard that Ciel-senpai came in the morning, so I might be able to meet her in the tea room.
<Page2>
"But, before that..."
It's not a good idea to go in empty-handed. Let's take a little detour.
<Page3>
It took me longer than I thought to get the supplies.
I knocked on the door of the tea ceremony room.
After a few moments, the door opened and senpai appeared.
<Page4>
"Oh, It's Tohno-kun"
She tilted her head in curiousity.
<Page5>
"Senpai. Would you like to have lunch with me?"
"Lunch?
I'm glad that you invited me, but..."
<Page6>
This doesn't look good.
Perhaps she has other things on her mind, but she seems to be wondering whether to accept the invitation or not.
Here's a little trick for you.
<Page7>
"We will have curry bread."
"Eh---?"
<Page8>
Senpai's expression began to glow visibly.
...... What is this? I don't mean to be rude to senpai, but she is really cute. .......
<Page9>
"I don't know. I'll give it to you in return for yesterday's lunch, so why don't you eat with me?"
<Page10>
"Oh, that's very kind of you, thank you.
...... That's right. If you want to thank me for yesterday, there's no reason to refuse."
Senpai stepped aside while fidgeting with her glasses, to let me into the room
<Page11>
"Please, make yourself comfortable.
I've just prepared tea."
<Page12>
Senpai walked into the next room.
I guess that's the hot water room.
<Page13>
"Ah ......"
When I entered the tea ceremony room, the reason for my senpai's pondering became clear.
There was an empty lunch box on the tatami.
Senpai had long since finished her lunch.
<Page14>
"Tohno-kun, would you like tea or black tea?"
"I'll have tea please.#　Anyways, senpai, did you finish your lunch?"
<Page15>
"Yes, a little while ago. I overslept today, so I didn't eat breakfast. I was very hungry in the morning."
<Page16>
"...... I see. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
I'll eat in class, so please take your time."
<Page17>
"Huh?? You didn't manage to get any bread?" 
Senpai's face popped out from the cafeteria. It looked exactly like the face of a child that didn't receive any presents on Christmas.
<Page18>
"No, because ...... you're full, senpai, right?."
"That's not true. I'm starving."
<Page19>
It was a quick answer.
It doesn't sound like ...... she's paying attention to me.
<Page20>
"That's fine then. But are you sure you're okay, senpai?
　The curry bread is quite large, isn't it?
"Don't worry about it. If it's something I like, I can eat it without limits."
<Page21>
I knew that yesterday.
　The shy smile on senpai's face was probably not because she was embarrassed by the second helping of lunch, but because she was genuinely looking forward to the curry bread.
<Page22>
"..............."
...... She's a mystery.
The fact that she is so happy about a single piece of curry bread makes me think that I might be a valuable person nowadays.
<Page23>
Senpai ate a piece of bread, I ate two, and then we had tea after lunch.
I sat down on the tatami and enjoyed a leisurely cup of tea with senpai.
<Page24>
"By the way, I saw the morning news.
Tono-kun, how is your new home?　It seems that something terrible has happened..."
<Page25>
"The news?"
...... Ah, I remember Hisui saying that the police came to interview her about the bloodstain.
<Page26>
"We have nothing to do with that news. My impressions of the house were that it was very nice on the inside, and that there were noisy wild dogs at night.
　The only problem is that there is no TV and no Japanese-style room. There is no place where you can drink tea like this.
<Page27>
"?　What's a wild dog? Isn't the incident that happened in front of Tono's mansion the case of the street thief?"
"No, if it was, it would've been a bigger deal than that.
There was no incident, just a bloodstain.
...... Well, but..."
<Page28>
That place is where I went to see the wild dogs late at night. ...... I couldn't say that.
<Page29>
"No, it's just a misunderstanding. Whatever it is, it's none of our business. We are relaxing senpai, so let's not talk about unpleasant things."
<Page30>
"That's not true. At least we live in this city, so I think the street incident has something to do with it!　I think Tono-kun lacks a sense of danger!
Senpai exaggerated by raising her voice.
This is the very image of a dependable senpai who scolds an unscrupulous Kouhai.
<Page31>
"But only going out at night is what's dangerous, isn't it?
There have been eight victims, so the police will probably catch the culprit soon.
<Page32>
"Damn it. If you keep talking like that, you'll get caught in your sleep.
The news has been saying the same thing since the third case, but in the end, the culprit hasn't been caught yet.
<Page33>
...... You're right.
The fact that murders continue to occur to this extent in modern Japan is beyond abnormal and may even be considered paranormal.
<Page34>
"......That's right. I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one living in this city who has to be careful.
<Page35>
"Yes. You just have to understand.
　Really, you shouldn't be following strangers. ...... If the culprit is a psycho who enjoys being treated like a vampire, Tohno-kun might be easy prey.
I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.
"...... No, um, senpai?　I'm not sure if that's a good metaphor.
<Page36>
I don't want to be a bad omen.
I have chronic anemia so i'm probably not a target for vampires.
<Page37>
"But if you think about it seriously, it's strange. I wonder why they gave him that nickname."
"?　You would've had all the blood drained from your body.　It's not wrong to use the metaphor of a vampire, is it?"
<Page38>
"...... I don't think so. It is a common belief that people who are sucked by vampires become vampires as well.
　I'm not sure what to make of that. You don't need to go to the trouble of giving it a horror story nickname, a simple murder case should be enough.
<Page39>
"Tono-kun, do you really believe that there are vampires?"
"...... You know what? I just went along with it because that's what the news is saying. If there really were vampires, as I said before, they wouldn't leave any dead bodies."
<Page40>
"That's true. But can't you also think of it this way?
　The corpses that have been found have been killed by vampires.
　There are two types of vampires, those who can become vampires and those who can't. Those who can become vampires are never found dead even if they are attacked by vampires. Because even now, they are still living in secret somewhere.
<Page41>
"Haha. That's a horror story, isn't it, senpai?"
"Yes, it's rather a horror story.
Unfortunately, there was no ending."
<Page42>
She smiles and sips her cup of hot water.
While we were talking about such trivial things, the lunch break was over.
<Page43>
She smiles and sips from her cup of tea.
I turned back from the tea ceremony room and said, "I'll take advantage of my senpai's kindness and go back to class.
<Page44>
"Arara, could it be Shiki-kun?
I'm surprised to run into you in this place"
I ran into Noel-sensei in an unexpected place.
<Page45>
Noel is holding a silver accessory in her right hand.
I wonder if it's a cross .......
<Page46>
"Oh, this?　I told you, I'm moonlighting as a hobby.
　The other wing is noisy, so I came to the quiet clubhouse wing to do my daily prayers.
　Anyway, what are you doing here?
　Do you have a secret meeting place around here?"
<Page47>
"No ......, it's..."
I can't just say that I was here to see a senpai from the tea ceremony club.
<Page48>
"No, I was just walking around to take my mind off things.
Lunch hasn't been served yet, so I thought I'd head back to the cafeteria."
　He tried to keep his tone as natural and vague as possible.
<Page49>
"Well, well, well. I'm sure you're not the only one. Shiki, are you aiming for music school or something?"
"No.　No, I'm not interested in music. ...... Why?"
<Page50>
"Hmm,
I'm just asking!
　Okay, bye!　Cafeteria, hurry up or your lunch break will be over!
<Page51>
　Noel-sensei winked and softly pressed her lips to the silver accessory in her hand.
　The sound of her stiff shoes disappeared into the back of the club building.

Unfortunately, there was no need to talk to her.
She didn't seem to care that I was at a loss for words, and kept smiling.

"Yes, it's near the first station.
But today is the last day for me to go to school by train."
"Oh. Are you moving?"

I couldn't think of a good explanation,
so I kept my mouth shut.
I gazed out the window and watched the city go by.
Perhaps sensing that I was not comfortable talking
about the situation, Ciel-senpai refrained from
questioning me further on that matter.

Our conversation lasted for 15 minutes,
and was quite casual.
The train soon arrived at my destination, Souya Station.

It was just before 7 am.
It was a little early for school, and the city had not yet woken up. The station was quiet now, but in another hour it would be full of people and cars.

She smiles and waves as she walks away.
I felt like running, but I didn't have a reason to do that.

Due to my health condition, I decided to go to school at my usual pace.

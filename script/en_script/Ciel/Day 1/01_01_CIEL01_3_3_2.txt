"What's the matter, Senpai? You don't look happy."
"What? Oh, well...
I was just a little surprised that you seem so relaxed."
<Page2>
It's just that I'm used to this kind of thing since I come from a strict family. More importantly, Senpai, when you said you wanted to talk, what did you mean?
<Page3>
"Oh, that's right.
Actually, I was really curious about the story I heard at lunch."
"...... What, you mean about my parents' house?"
"Yes," nodded Senpai.
<Page4>
"If you don't mind, Tohno-kun."
You see, I was wondering if you're in some kind of trouble that's causing you move at this time of the year."
"It would be boring to listen to me talk about my house. I think it's a waste of time."
<Page5>
"It doesn't matter if it's boring.
I just want to hear it."
"...Huh. You're very curious, aren't you?"
"I guess so," she laughed.
<Page6>
"Then let's continue our conversation.
You said you were returning to your own home, but you've never gone back to your parents' house?
<Page7>
"Yes. For various reasons, I haven't been back to my parents' house for almost seven years.
I had an accident when I was ten, and since then I've had chronic anemia. The Tohno mansion was too uncomfortable for me, so I was sent to a relative's house to recuperate, until yesterday.
<Page8>
"Oh ......  that must have been hard.
So, how's your wound?"
"It's healed perfectly. The only after effect is anemia, but my father said that I had it before the accident, so I'm not concernced about it."
<Page9>
"I see ...... I'm sorry to make you tell such a painful story.
So, you're saying that these relatives are the ones who raised you from the age of ten?"
<Page10>
"That's right. Their family name was Arima, and they were very good people, too good for me."
My words were filled with gratitude for those people, even if I did not consciously know it.
I think I was happy to have stayed in that house for seven years.
<Page11>
"Were?' You're speaking in the past tense. Are you saying that Arimas didn't treat you like family because they knew that you would eventually return to your parents' home?..."
<Page12>
"What? No, that's not what I meant.
I didn't expect the Tohnos to call me back at all. Keiko-san and I thought we'd be living together forever."
"You didn't think they would call you back?
Even though you're the eldest son of the Tohno family?
<Page13>
"Yes... To tell you the truth, my recovery was just a front. My father and I never got along. It's like he threw out of the house because of my injury."
<Page14>
"...re you sure you're not mistaken about that?"
"Yes, I'm sure.
If I'm wrong, it's alright."
<Page15>
Being as honest as I can with Senpai, I respond. 
I'm sure I must be smiling.
I feel the warmth of her concern as she tells me that we may have just been misunderstanding each other.
<Page16>
"But I can't be sure of that anymore.
He just recently passed away. Because his death was so sudden, those seven years of misunderstanding are now over, unresolved."
...Beyond that.
That is, if there ever truly was a misunderstanding. 
<Page17>
"So, now that your father is gone.
You're to come home to your family's house, they said."
"Yes. The new head of the family urged me to come home as soon as possible. It's scary, but I'm going to have to go back today."
<Page18>
I finish the conversation.
Ciel took a slight breath and looked back at me, as if she had something on her mind.
<Page19>
"Can I ask you something?"
The seriousness of his voice made me straighten my back.
"Please do. If I can, I'll answer."
<Page20>
"I see. Then I'll be straight with you.
Just now, you were talking about the Arima family in the past tense. You're already thinking of them as a separate group. Tohno-kun, did you hate your previous family that much?"
<Page21>
My former family--does she mean the Arima people who were my parents for the past seven years?
A mother and father who were not my real parents.
A strange building that was supposed to be a relative's house.
But none of that mattered at all―――
<Page22>
"No, I loved them. They didn't care that I wasn't related to them by blood, and they were so warm that it made me feel ashamed to be so isolated and depressed.
To love me so unconditionally, I thought everything might not be a distaster after all."
<Page23>
　―――I knew that these people loved me.
     So, as soon as possible.
　　　　I had to become a real part of their family―――
<Page24>
That's what I've been telling myself since I was a child.
...Really, it's been such a long time.
I've been vowing that over and over again for so long that it makes me feel faint.
<Page25>
"But you couldn't."
"Yeah. My personality is such that I heat up and cool down easily, but I'm sure that's just how I am."
<Page26>
No matter how happy I was to be loved, the next day I still felt like a stranger.
Thinking about it like that, I can't possibly keep my mind off it. 
<Page27>
Then, at least.
I try not to forget the fact that they cared for me.
<Page28>
"It's especially true when it comes to family. I couldn't return the love my father and mother gave me.
Why―――"
<Page29>
I couldn't get the thought out of my head that since I couldn't do that, I wasn't part of their family.
Maybe it was because of my trauma as a child. Thanks to that, no matter where I went, I always felt like a stranger to my family.
<Page30>
Senpai remained silent.
She averted her gaze and squared her shoulders apologetically.
<Page31>
"See, that was a boring story.
I'm sorry for wasting your time, Senpai."
"No, not at all. It was a very meaningful conversation."
Trying to light up the mood, she forced a smile.
<Page32>
"But it was a little unexpected. I thought Tohno-kun was a laid-back kid."
<Page33>
"Yeah, I am a pretty relaxed person. I've made it my motto to enjoy the present as much as possible.
Isn't it happier to look forward to what's ahead than what's already over?"
Well, that's what Arihiko once told me.
<Page34>
"Looking forward to the future, huh?
That's a good idea. I want to support it with all my might."
<Page35>
"Hmm, enjoying it as much as possible, is that it...
...Fufu. Then, for the time being, do you want to go to school together tomorrow?"
<Page36>
"What?"
The sudden invitation makes my eyes light up... I finally realized that I've been talking about myself without any reason.
<Page37>
"Oh, no, that's not what I meant! It's not that I'm not enjoying myself, it's just that I'm hoping for the best, and if I'm going to hit on Senpai, I should take more steps beforehand."
"Yes, of course I was joking.
I know that Tohno-kun is a gentleman."
<Page38>
...It's a little disappointing, but I'm glad that I didn't cause any misunderstanding.
I regained my composure and sipped my teacup.
The tea was completely cooled by the long conversation.
<Page39>
We continued to talk for about an hour.
Senpai was happy to listen to whatever I had to say, which was fun, but I was tired because I was not used to talking for so long.
<Page40>
The most popular story was about the school trip, which apparently the Senpai didn't go on. She had caught a cold the day before and had to take a day off.
<Page41>
"It was during the second year of junior high-school, which means you were 14 years old.
I would have liked to have seen you at that age."
I would have blushed even if I hadn't been told that with a smile.
<Page42>
We had a lot to talk about, but the sun would set soon.
The tea ceremony room was about to be closed, so I decided to leave the room ahead of Senpai and head off.

This is the Q&A corner where we guide Tohno-kun
who has reached a dead end that he has no clue about,
<Page2>
It's time for "Teach me! Ciel-Sensei!".
Good evening. Instructor Ciel here.
<Page3>
God Cat. (TL: I am the god of cats)
<Page4>
Now then. About the cause of death this time,
how do you explain what just happened, God?
<Page5>
Dunno, I'm just an ordinary god.
I didn't even get to pick a choice after all.
<Page6>
Right, this is quite the rare case.
This is an outcome that occured due to a much earlier choice.
<Page7>
It was morally wrong for you to lie to your family,
let alone to go investigating so late at night.
<Page8>
If you know about the choice that I'm referring to,
then go back to that choice and be more sincere.
<Page9>
Lying is bad, honesty is king nya.
Yup, yup. That's exactly right.
<Page10>
Come on, take a good look at my beautiful self
that looks just like that vampire heroine...
<Page11>
After all, deep down a heroine should never lie
or have anything to hide.
<Page12>
Hey, isn't that right, Ciel-sensei?
<Page13>
Speaking of which, is there something that
you would like to share with us nya~?
<Page14>
---Tch!
<Page15>
Nya nya nya, it's useless～☆
You'll never land a hit on my honest heart nya～☆
<Page16>
Oof oof wah st- sto- nyagh
<Page17>
Haah... well that wasn't so painful...
I see... I guess we were... evenly matched...
<Page18>
With all being said, this is the end!
Let's meet again at the next dead end lesson!

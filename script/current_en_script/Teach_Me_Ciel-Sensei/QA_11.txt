The protagonist is not the only one who faces a dead end.
A merciless end comes even to the heroine.
<Page2>
No one is spared from this story.
And with that being said---
<Page3>
Let's hear some thoughts from our lovely heroine
who tragically met a brutal end for the second time!
<Page4>
The stand's all yours Arcueid!
And also congratulations to the next heroine in line!
<Page5>
...You are quite the crude instructor.
Are you aware that you possess a barrier for fundamental reasoning?
<Page6>
...Huh?
Umm, and who might you be...?
<Page7>
Where did that cat-like creature run off to?
I thought she was Arcueid's representative. Huh?
<Page8>
...How utterly wrong.
Not only are you dull, but your intelligence is also lacking.
<Page9>
That creature you speak of is not her alter ego,
nor is it her messenger.
<Page10>
It is simply an anomaly; a jargon that has been misinterpreted
as an urban legend and started to walk on its own.
<Page11>
If you are seeking for thoughts regarding her demise,
there exists someone more qualified than that creature.
<Page12>
Needless to say, I'm talking about myself.
After all, I'm no stranger to this matter.
<Page13>
...I-It can't be.
<Page14>
The Arcueid before me in this corner is not the cat-like
creature that had been here until now, but...
<Page15>
Indeed. The Arcueid Brunestud that is
present in this corner, is me.
<Page16>
It costs a severe amount of money to have me
appear as an image of the future just like you,
<Page17>
so in order to minimize the cost, I have appeared
as an image of my past.
<Page18>
... That's right.
<Page19>
Since I'm an economical version of Arcueid,
you can call me Eco-Arc.
<Page20>
Eco-Arc...!
<Page21>
Then that means that feline
creature won't appear anymore, right? Woohoo!
<Page22>
Please lower your expectations.
In short, I will only appear on rare occasions.
<Page23>
From here on, and after, for all of eternity,
that creature will become your partner.
<Page24>
Oh, is that so...
I appreciate your declaration of my hellish future...
<Page25>
But then, why is is that
Eco-Arc is here with me this time?
<Page26>
Surely you must be here to complain about
the mess that Tohno-kun made?
<Page27>
...Perhaps so.
Even I found myself covering my eyes at the end.
<Page28>
...Not only did he succumb into his desires,
but he could not even protect himself afterwards.
<Page29>
With the way things turned out, even I cannot supress my disdain.
I am furious... No, worse. I pity you.
<Page30>
Now then, Ciel-Sensei.
I have a favor to ask.
<Page31>
Y-Yes!?
How may I be of service, ma'am?
<Page32>
If you ever have to fight against that thing,
please give it a merciless beating.
<Page33>
After all, you can not become a fine lady until
you have at least one traumatic experience.
<Page34>
? I wouldn't have any trouble fighting against
Arcueid without being told...
<Page35>
Huh? Don't tell me that the one
you are actually talking about is...
<Page36>
I have nothing else to add to that matter.
I leave him to you from here on out.
<Page37>
As unreliable of an instructor you may be,
I can at least trust you as much as a shelf.
<Page38>
Ehh... what was that about?
<Page39>
I'm late, I'm late...!
Neco here, arriving at the speed of light!
<Page40>
That's right,  the speed of light caused me to overtake my
oversleeping self and thus, cancelling out the fact that I was late.
<Page41>
Heya, mornin' Ciel-kun!
Looking sub-heroine-like today too, how splendid!
<Page42>
By the way, did I happen to come here earlier?
<Page43>
I feeeel like that was the case nya~.
To be more precise, a super pretty version me.
<Page44>
I don't think there was anyone here that met that criteria.
More impor - tant - ly...
<Page45>
How would you like to punished for being late?
Burning at the stake, groin split, wooden horse, iron maiden...
<Page46>
We have a variety of methods available,
so the choice is all yours.
<Page47>
Ah. Perhaps you would like to be cut into pieces
and bleed to death just like the original Arcueid?
<Page48>
Please stop using words that I've never heard before.
Besides, the only one with dead ends is glasses
<Page49>
Eei.
<Page50>
Uwahh, this Indian is serious! Executing me 
just for being late, have you finally shown your true colors!?
<Page51>
Oh no, this was not my original intention,
but there was someone who asked for a favor â™¥
<Page52>
The story seemed to be nearing the climax,
so I thought I might as well change the leading role here.
<Page53>
Stoop, even for your modification fetish, this is too far~~!!
What are you going to do if it becomes a habit?

I wonder if you've gotten used to the sudden deaths by now?
<Page2>
This is a rescue corner for Tohno-kun
who has died despite his best efforts,
<Page3>
"Teach Me! Ciel-Sensei!".
As usual, let's begin the lesson!
<Page4>
That being said, this is just a standard 3-choice path, right?
We just have to go back and pick another option, no?
<Page5>
Shouldn't the rescue corner be
about saving people before they get killed?
<Page6>
I only realized this just now, but,
<Page7>
isn't this section just us seeing how glasses
instantly dies and then me giving my take on it?
<Page8>
Huh? Well you're not wrong, but what about it?
<Page9>
Besides, deaths aren't memorable if they're not painful, right?
<Page10>
Mmmm~~, you went right past Sparta and straight to Sadist.
<Page11>
Now then, the cause of death this time is due to
Tohno-kun entering the school at night alone.
<Page12>
There was no senior to rely on, and there was
no way Arcueid would go to an isolated place at this point.
<Page13>
So go back to the previous choice
and choose a place that is more bloody!
<Page14>
"At this point"?
Did I hear that correctly?
<Page15>
Ciel, do you know why a perfect
heroine like that decided to run away (be cute)?
<Page16>
Why wouldn't she rush home after feeling
her stamina running out?
<Page17>
Who knows.
I can't really say.
<Page18>
If I had to guess, maybe it's because she finally
realized that she was a vampire? Or something like that.
<Page19>
I mean, she seemed to be losing control of herself
ever since they were at that garage full of dead apostles.
<Page20>
Really? Did you feel your chances of winning
slip away after her fever (cuteness) from back then?
<Page21>
Are you okay? Wanna go back home (India)?
<Page22>
Who says that I'm from India!
<Page23>
More importantly, just because it's your route
doesn't mean you should get too carried away.
<Page24>
It's not just the adorable Tohno-kun,
for whom instant death fits well, that can die instantly.
<Page25>
Did you just say "fits well"?
<Page26>
As the story progresses, there is a possibility that
anyone can die. Arcueid is no exception.
<Page27>
Ehh~~?
Surely there's no way I could lose from here.
<Page28>
We're pretty much near the climactic ending, right?
Even a newborn calico cat like me knows this.
<Page29>
I see.
So what would happen if you were wrong?
<Page30>
Nyha nyha nyha. How silly... If that did happen,
I would gladly give up my seat to the next heroine!
<Page31>
Hold on a sec.
Did I hear something unpleasant just now?
<Page32>
Now that I've got your word, let's wrap up the lesson!
<Page33>
That's all for this corner,
"Goodbye! Neco Arc-Sensei" ~â˜†
<Page34>
Oi, stop with that scary face! Are you really a heroine?

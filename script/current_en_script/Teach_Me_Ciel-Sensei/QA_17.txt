Whoa, is this the first time you've fought a heroine?
Take a deep breath, boy.
<Page3>
As sad it may be, this is who Ciel is.
A merciless, spicy monster.
<Page4>
As for the protagonist,
after 2 or 3 times,
<Page5>
I hope you will face the dead end the same way
you do going to the convenience store.
<Page6>
That's right.
You should never expose your back to the enemy.
<Page7>
If you are going to retreat, at the very least
try to break their stance.
<Page8>
An empty back is just a simple target.
Especially when you're losing on speed.
<Page9>
Your opponent has far more combat experience than you,
so you have to think outside the box...
<Page10>
or face her head-on with desperate determination.
<Page11>
It's okay. If you can get through this,
you'll definitely have a chance.
<Page12>
Even with this overwhelming power gap,
this Indian is talking about hopes and dreams.
<Page13>
Stay strong, Glasses...!

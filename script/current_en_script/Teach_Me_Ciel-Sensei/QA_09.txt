Hmm? It seems that after day 10 started as usual,
we went to school as usual and then the game just ended.
<Page2>
What the heck is going on Ciel?
An error? Is there nothing else after this nya?
<Page3>
No matter how I see it, there weren't any bad choices nya...
Eh? You broke a promise with your sister?
<Page4>
But the promise with that blonde beauty is more important right?
I'm pretty sure this was the correct route too, but why...?
<Page5>
What are you talking about?
<Page6>
With how much Akiha-san had worried about you,
you still decided to go out. You failed as an older brother.
<Page7>
Although you have already collapsed many times until now,
today you are experiencing a more peculiar illness.
<Page8>
You won't be able to recover without a half day of rest,
so make sure you rest properly okay?
<Page9>
Of course, it is completely okay to miss
the meeting with Arcueid.
<Page10>
Since the promise was made orally, it is not
legally enforceable and thus not punishable â™¥
<Page11>
But this ain't an issue of legality nya~.
It's a matter of what's right in our hearts nya~.
<Page12>
But if this ends up with them breaking up,
perhaps a new romance will be formed... ehehe...
<Page13>
It's here... I feel it...
I can feel a date event right around the corner...!
<Page14>
Oh right. Ciel's the only without a date event, right?
Sorry... for being too blessed, that is.
<Page15>
Oh not at all. In fact, we spend an extraordinary amount of time
together at school as well and not only at night, so don't mention it.
<Page16>
If you look at the ratio of time talked with Tohno-kun
which is 4:6, you can see that I'm ahead.
<Page17>
Huuh?
Isn't most of it just you explaining the church stuff?
<Page18>
It's not as long as the lecture on the vampire hierarchy.
<Page19>
In our case, it was simply a pure, platonic conversation
between a lost junior and his reliable senior.
<Page20>
If you're talking about school, I was there too.
<Page21>
But that was more you trespassing, wasn't it?
<Page22>
Well I had cool clothes like the battle outfit.
<Page23>
Ah, you mean that dress you used again Vlov? (laughs).
At least the transformation sequence was nice (laughs).
<Page24>
You're dead, punk!
<Page25>
Come at me!

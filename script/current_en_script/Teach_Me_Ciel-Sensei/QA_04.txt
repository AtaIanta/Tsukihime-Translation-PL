Oh dear, Dead End!
<Page2>
You there, Tohno-kun!
Stop right there, you are under arrest for speeding!
<Page3>
Why do you look so happy, Ciel?
There's a BBQ'd protagonist right here, you know?
<Page4>
Pardon me. The big battle had finally begun
so I got a bit carried away...
<Page5>
This Q&A corner is brought to you by your guiding
instructor Ciel, and this outsider Neco...
<Page6>
Welcome to "Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!"
<Page7>
Depending on how you played,
this may have been your first dead end.
<Page8>
In that case, how do I put this...
It was because you chose what was natural, this time at least.
<Page9>
But let's stay calm and check the situation carefully.
Humans can not survive under flames!
<Page10>
Well, from a feline point of view,
I can appreciate this kind of dead end nya.
<Page11>
Think about it, there's a beautiful woman fighting in front of you.
Who in their right mind could keep their cool? There's a phrase for this.
<Page12>
"A chestnut in the fire is a picnic.
Welcome, welcome, welcome."
<Page13>
What do you think?
Does it irresistibly whet your appetite, mademoiselle?
<Page14>
No, I have no idea what you're saying...
Although, I personally like my meat well-done...
<Page15>
Oh really? That was unexpected.
You don't like your steak a little bloody even though you're from France?
<Page16>
I like tender meat the most when it comes to beef curry,
but rare steak is a bit... at least mentally.
<Page17>
The people who like rare, or something like raw sashimi,
would be someone like Akiha-san, I guess.
<Page18>
I mean, Japanese people are known for cooking sashimi
out of raw fish, right? It's honestly unbelievable.
<Page19>
You fool. Fish is better the more fresh it is.
<Page20>
If you don't take my word,
I'll buy you a round of sushi next time.
<Page21>
You do like "karei" (righteye flounder), right otaku?
<Page22>
...Well, it's not like I eat the
same menu every day either...
<Page23>
Sometimes seafood is the way to go...
<Page24>
Right. It seems that we have completely different tastes.
Oh well. Come on, wrap it up. We'll have dinner after this.
<Page25>
R-right, of course.
We're still in the middle of the lesson.
<Page26>
Well, in other words, a fight between vampires
is extremely dangerous, so just watch the fight calmly from afar.
<Page27>
Don't worry. I'm sure Tohno-kun will have his chance to shine.
So until then, make sure that you stay alive at all cost!
<Page28>
---Right, that's job well done!
We're going straight to Messiaen!
<Page29>
...This time it's seafood curry!
<Page30>

I felt sorry for Noel in the lesson earlier,
but now I've changed my mind.
<Page2>
These so called 'Executors' sure are something.
What, are your workplaces really that stressful?
<Page3>
The dead end this time was due to Noel's personal judgement.
It seems that her screws are loose when she's alone...
<Page4>
I have been careful to not let this happen so far,
but this time I slipped up for various reasons...
<Page5>
Hmm.
And what were those reasons exactly?
<Page6>
(a) The Priest Executor summoned Executor Ciel
after hearing an anonymous report from Sister Noel.
<Page7>
(b) Executor Ciel, who went into the sewers alone, learned of
Roa's condition and went to Tohno's mansion to search for answers.
<Page8>
It could be one or the other.
<Page9>
In terms of (a), it would have been good if I was in a
situation where I could ignore the call to summons in the afternoon.
<Page10>
I don't have to tell you about the case of (b).
It was due to Tohno-kun's restraint that led to a bad result.
<Page11>
So let's be proactive on this day!
You must prioritize the tea room, no matter what!
<Page12>
I see. So it was Ciel's weight that
acted as a safety net for Noel.
<Page13>
That being said, even in (b)'s case
Ciel would still return back to the tea room, right?
<Page14>
Why did you turn a blind eye and allow
such a torturous time to take place?
<Page15>
Well... that's because infiltrating Tohno's mansion alone is a bit...
<Page16>
A bit...?
<Page17>
Let's just say that I would suffer a fate much worse
than Tohno-kun... or something like that.
<Page18>
Stop that, this nyain't funny at all.
What kind of horrors are in that mansion!?

Eh... what's up with this ending?
Was Tsukihime always a horror game?
<Page2>
Rather what the heck are you doing Glasses?
<Page3>
Are you telling me that you just died from falling
into a horde of zombies after being hit from behind?
<Page4>
Oh. Actually. That does makes sense.
Going up against zombies is basically futile.
<Page5>
If you cut a zombie, it will bite back.
Looking at it from a bigger picture, of course that would happen nya.
<Page6>
Remember folks, don't go into a building
with a sign that says "Do not enter", okay?
<Page7>
(This cat actually said something reasonable...)
<Page8>
Ahem. It was very noble of you to be so eager to
fight to protect the people of the city.
<Page9>
However, it seems that luck was not on your side.
This is a problem that Tohno-kun can not handle alone.
<Page10>
How unfortunate... Perhaps if things turned out a little differently,
you could try going back to the department store again with that same courage.
<Page11>
Huuh. So you're telling him to go again after witnessing that bloodshed.
You must definitely be a sadist.
<Page12>
But why did this turn out so bad?
Maybe challenging them to a rap battle was the play here?
<Page13>
The two men who were guarding the department store
were irritated because there had been some trouble the day before.
<Page14>
The hard-working heroine had surveyed the department store that day
so they were on guard as a result.
<Page15>
However, if for whatever reason
that heroine was not able to work on that day...
<Page16>
Then the two guards at the department store
would not have had such murderous intent.
<Page17>
I don't want to say this out loud, but once you clear
one of the routes, spend some time after school in the tea room.
<Page18>
This department store vampire event
is a major turning point for a heroine change.

Good afternoon.
Were you surprised at the sudden bad end?
<Page2>
This is the rescue corner to guide the lost Tohno-kun
to the right ending,
<Page3>
Welcome to "Teach me, Ciel-sensei!".
Instructor Ciel here (presumed to be 18 years old).
<Page4>
Seriously?
How come you're an instructor when it says "teacher" in the title?
<Page5>
Well, let's not worry about these small details.
You'll come to understand the gist when you see me in action.
<Page6>
Good afternoon, Somire Queen of the bad end world,
banned from the main story for being too overly sexy Neco-Arc here.
<Page7>
You, are you perhaps new to this kind of adult corner?
Well this is the first lesson after all, so let's settle down shall we?
<Page8>
It's fine for you to just ignore this creature next to me.
Basically, just pay attention to what I have to say for these lessons.
<Page9>
Now, about the cause of death this time...
<Page10>
You're already burning up, Glasses-kun.
Isn't being a human torch on the road a bit too hardcore?
<Page11>
How did it even turn out like this, Ciel?
Were there landmines in the streets of this town?
<Page12>
To answer that question, it was because
you went out out alone even though you were spotted.
<Page13>
"There's no way I'm staying in a room with this brain-dead vampire,
 so I'm going back home!"
<Page14>
I understand how painful it is for you, 
but you must be patient little one.
<Page15>
Although you were dragged into this mess,
you can't deny that you are involved now.
<Page16>
This enemy in question... until you deal with this vampire,
you absolutely must not go back home!
<Page17>
Even when you go outside,
you still have one last chance right?
<Page18>
At that time, 
all you have to do is go back to the hotel.
<Page19>
But like... it would be embarassing if the heroine's 
favorability went down because you came back half-way...
<Page20>
Let's lower it all they way.
Better yet, please take this lesson with a grain of salt.
<Page21>
After all, this vampire's favorability wouldn't be lowered
no matter what Tohno-kun does!
<Page22>
Ehh. Surely that is not the case nya~.
There are times when you get angry you know?
<Page23>
But you know, I can't get enough
of that frantic feeling whenever she's yelling and stuff.
<Page24>
Well look here.
Don't you have any awareness of romance and such?
<Page25>
Even though you're the same heroine, it would be nice 
were cool and just as hard-working as her.
<Page26>
Huh?
(What the hell is she on about?)
<Page27>
Eh?
(What kind of reaction is that?)
<Page28>
Eh?
(Wait, you're serious aren't you?)

Why do the birds sing?
Why do the shrimps jump?
<Page2>
Why did the protagonist break into a locked room?
<Page3>
The intelligence program that tackles countless mysteries
in human history head on, "Teach Me! Ciel-Sensei", 
<Page4>
begins right now.
<Page5>
Hello there. Did you enjoy your break from the
past 6-8 days of no bad ends?
<Page6>
The story is getting closer to its climax.
From here on, there will be many more death flags,
<Page7>
but for the wise and prudent Tohno-kun,
you can choose your options with great caution.
<Page8>
Now as for the dead end this time...
It was a blow to the back, wasn't it...
<Page9>
It seems that glasses was too careless nya.
Or perhaps that bandaged guy is more than he seems?
<Page10>
As strange and captivating that room may be... the fault
lies on Tohno-kun's carelessness.
<Page11>
In the first place,
this kind of undercover work should be done in a pair.
<Page12>
One person should watch the door to spot anyone coming
while the other examines the documents...
<Page13>
It would be best to refrain from investigating this study
until you team up with someone you can rely on.
<Page14>
Just like a S P Y!
Mmm, but do we know anyone that fits that bill?
<Page15>
Ciel is a martial artist,
so I don't think she's suited for that kind of thing.
<Page16>
There's nothing that I can't do when alone,
but following Tohno-kun and infiltrating...
<Page17>
Frankly it would not suit me at all.
It would be nice if you could find that ally someday.
<Page18>
Hehehe... you just revealed a new flag...
Who could it be? One of the maids? Sacchin?
<Page19>
Well, I guess we'll see.
<Page20>
At the very least, this stuff is not
related to our vampire case.
<Page21>
Now then. The cause of death is clear this time,
so you can simply go back and pick the other choice.
<Page22>
A wise man stays away from danger.
Avoid Tohno Makihisa's study and proceed to a safer place!
<Page23>
With deathtraps all over the place,
what is up with this mansion?

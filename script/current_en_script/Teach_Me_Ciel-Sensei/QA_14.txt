Eh?
How did we reach this dead end?
<Page2>
Since you chose the senior you admire so much,
shouldn't the relationship be formed and then go to the ending?
<Page3>
CQ. CQ.
Do you copy, Ciel? Please respond, over.
<Page4>
You need to calm down.
Nothing's changed since the 13th lesson, right?
<Page5>
Eh!? ...But we had such perfect communication
no matter how you look at it...
<Page6>
Why is it that humans only put themselves on a pedestal?
What are you, a broken crane?
<Page7>
I guess it can't be helped nya.
I suppose I could lend a hand and such.
<Page8>
There's nothing wrong with wanting to help people in a dilemma.
However...
<Page9>
When you are at a scene of a disaster, please keep in
mind that you are just another victim.
<Page10>
Do as much as you can to help others,
but only while securing your own safety first.
<Page11>
I know it's tough, but that's the limit of being human.
You can just ignore Ciel this time.
<Page12>
You should resist the urge and go help that useless office lady,
just like resisting the urge to eat a large bowl of curry.
<Page13>
That office lady looks nyaighty fine by this cat's standards.
There's no harm in rescuing her... right?
<Page14>
Haa...!?
<Page15>
Y-yeah. I wouldn't blame you for
making such a difficult choice.
<Page16>
I'll keep Tohno-kun's feelings deep in my heart,
so please go and help Noel-san.
<Page17>
Oh. But you shouldn't go and expect
a favor in return for rescuing her.
<Page18>
Tohno-kun is a student and Noel-san is a teacher.
<Page19>
You should always keep an appropriate distance
so that nothing outrageous happens between you two!
<Page20>
Nyeh heh heh.
<Page21>
Just for reference, what if by some chance
this triggers a flag for Noel's route?
<Page22>
? In that case, we'll have to arrange an additional
supplementary lesson for "Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!".
<Page23>
Oh yeah. Then we could name
the lesson, "Forgive Me! Ciel-Sensei!"
<Page24>
For Tohno-kun, it would be his first offense so he will get
a mild punishment, but for Noel-san, perhaps something a bitmore severe â™¥
<Page25>
Hmm. So this was a prison and not a training institute.
Hang in there Noel. Survive...!

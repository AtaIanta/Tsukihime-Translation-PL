I finished dinner and went back to my room.
The time was around 9:30.
I had spent a full two hours in the dining room.
<Page2>
"Welcome back, Shiki sama. Although you did not instruct me to do so, I have prepared your bed.
<Page3>
.......
In the room, Hisui was quietly making the bed.
It seems that she had returned a step ahead of me to get things ready.
<Page4>
"Oh...yes, thank you."
"You can use your nightgown there.
and put your clothes in basket and leave them out in the hallway.
<Page5>
A woven wooden basket was placed at the foot of the bed.
If you put your clothes in this basket and leave it in the hallway, she will wash them for you.
...... It's getting more and more like a luxury hotel.
<Page6>
"Do you have any questions for me?"
Hisui did not move an eyebrow.
I have many questions, but I don't know anything about Hisui and Kohaku.
<Page7>
"This is not really relevant, okay?"
"Yes, what is it?"
"I'd like to know what kind of work you and Kohaku-san do here, if you don't mind."
<Page8>
"I am in charge of Shiki-sama, and my sister Kohaku is in charge of Akiha-sama. I'm in charge of the house while you two are away, what about it?"
".......So that's what it means to take care of "
<Page9>
My shoulders are heavy with disappointment.
Akiha said it as a matter of course, but I'm just an ordinary high school student.
I don't have a hobby to be taken care of by a girl around my age at the moment.
<Page10>
"....Does that mean you're my personal maid?"
"Yes. I'm at your disposal."
Hisui bowed deeply.
The stabbing pain in my chest is due to my selfish guilt.
<Page11>
"All right. Akiha's not going to leave me alone, and I don't think it's a good idea to fire you because of my feelings. I'll be grateful for your help, but..."
<Page12>
"Do you have a special request?"
"It's not that big of a deal. ...... You know, "Shiki-sama" is a bit to much for me...
I'm not that kind of person, and to be honest, I feel like I've been grabbed by the neck because I'm so unworthy of it."
<Page13>
"But you are my master."
"I've been living a normal life until today.
It's a little difficult to live a life where you've just returned home and a kid your own age calls you "sama".
 "Huh." Hisui replied absent-mindedly.
<Page14>
"You can call me Tohno-san or Shiki-san. I don't want to be too formal.
I'll just call you Hisui-san.
<Page15>
".................."
Hisui lowered her eyebrows expressionlessly and bit her lips hard.
...... Oh, man.
I wanted to make it easier for her, but I'm making it harder.
<Page16>
"But you're my employer."
"I'm not the one hiring you, am I?"
<Page17>
"...... With all due respect. It's the same thing, Shiki-sama.
We are servants of the Tohno family. The head of the family and her relatives are both respected masters.
Therefore, please just call me Hisui.
I hope you can understand the feelings of a servant who is called by honorific by the person she serves."
<Page18>
"Mm."
...... I can't argue with that.
Her remarks make sense as a servant.
<Page19>
"....... You do things I can't do, so I'm the one who should be thanking you. ......"
I'll only annoy Hisui by sharing my opinion here.
For now, I'll try to keep my thoughts to myself.
<Page20>
"Then, should I call you.... Hisui?"
"Yes, by all means."
"............haha."
The way she said "by all means" was a little bit like what Hisui would say.
<Page21>
"Okay . Then do that.
But please don't be too formal with me. I'd appreciate it if you could tell your sister, Kohaku, the same."
"Yes. If you say so, Shiki-sama.
<Page22>
Hisui bowed her head.
---Good. We have a long way to go before we can have a frank conversation.
<Page23>
Hisui bowed and left the room.
As soon as I was alone, I felt a rush of fatigue.
...... Too much has happened since this morning.
My body needs to sleep.
<Page24>
I turn off the lights and lie down in bed.
A narcotic desire to sleep.
My exhausted body drains the vitality from my limbs, forcing me to fall asleep.
<Page25>
To resist the temptation I keep my eye lids open, but it is a futile resistance.
No matter how much I don't want to sleep, I will eventually fall asleep.
That's how the human body is made.
<Page26>
...... While I was in between wakefulness and sleep, I gazed at the ceiling in a daze.
<Page27>
...... home for the first time in seven years.
....... family for the first time in seven years.
...... I feel like it's someone else's house.
"But I'm back, aren't I?
...... monologue to accept that fact.
<Page28>
...... consciousness sinks to depths from which there is no turning back.
...... A mansion on a hill where the bustle of the city does not reach.
......An isolated island on land, surrounded by tall trees.
...... A moment after I closed my eyes, I realized that it was like a prison, even after all this time.

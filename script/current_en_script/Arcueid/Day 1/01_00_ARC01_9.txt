ã€€At the dinner table I had to sit face to face with Akiha.
Hisui and Kohaku-san devoted themselves to serving us.
The master and the servants do not sit on the same table.
...... Naturally, it was an uncomfortable dinner for me, who was used to the company of Arima family.
<Page2>
In addition, I had completely forgotten about table manners.
Humans are experts in optimization, relegating unused memories to a corner of the mind. In other words, there is no reason for me to remember table manners.
<Page3>
It was quite tense and thrilling to see Akiha's eyebrows raise at my every move.
...... Honestly, the thought of having to repeat this every day is really depressing.
<Page4>
Dinner was over without any conversation.
I was so busy trying to remember my table manners that I didn't have time for conversation.
And Akiha seemed to be in a foul mood.
<Page5>
Then, right after Hisui and Kohaku finished cleaning up the dishes.
<Page6>
"It seems that a thorough re-education is necessary."
She said firmly.
The devil's words, merciless in content and chilling in tone, were circulated into the dining room.
<Page7>
"Re-education? For whom?"
"You Nii-san,I want you to have approprite attitude. "
I knew it: .......
So that's what you were thinking while you were eating, with your neat eyebrows twitching. .......
<Page8>
"......What exactly do you mean by that?"
"The first thing to do is to improve your lifestyle. No going out at night, of course. The curfew is set at eight o'clock.
Whenever you go out, for any reason, ask permission from me, Kohaku or Hisui."
<Page9>
"Wha......?
8 o'clock curfew? Nowadays? And before that, I need someone's permission to go outside?
"Wait, that's...
<Page10>
"I'll set up a study schedule for the holidays.
According to the report, Nii-san's grades are just about average.
......#That's right. As usual, you're only good at cutting corners efficiently."
"Heck no. I always do my best."
<Page11>
"But while you're in this mansion, you're going to have to be serious, so be prepared for that.
You are a person who can do it if you put your mind to it, so even taking your health into account, you should be in the top three in your grade.
<Page12>
My sister's overestimation is painful.
I'm also afraid that she is already researching my grades.
<Page13>
"Let's wait until you're a little more settled before we do anything else.
So before that,--- Nii-san, take out your thing."
"Yes?"
What's that thing she's talking about?
<Page14>
"I'm talking about that thing.
You have it. In your pants. That filthy thing that's the symbol of youth.
Don't hide it, I'm telling you."
<Page15>
"NO!! I don't understand!!
Is this what the upper class does? What the hell do you think you're doing?"
<Page16>
"I'm telling you to take out your phone.
You have a smartphone, don't you, Nii-san?
"------#I see."
<Page17>
I took out the mobile device that I had kept in the back pocket of my pants.
When I put it on the dining table, Hisui silently collected it and handed it to Akiha.
<Page18>
"I'm confiscating this. This type of electronic device is prohibited in our house. They are unnecessary for healthy students.
If you want to use the phone, use the one provided in the lobby. If you want to do some research, please use the library.
<Page19>
Ending the conversation, Akiha walked out of the cafeteria.
<Page20>
I stood there in shock for the second time today, and the biggest one yet.
It's not that I don't have the courage to fight back, but I'm not the type of person who uses a cell phone that much.
I only use it to check my e-mail or to read the news while waiting. But I'm no different from other people in that my mobile device is a basic element of my life.
<Page21>
Once again, I shudder at the strictness of Tohno's house. I can't believe that in this Internet society, there was a house that banned smartphones ......!

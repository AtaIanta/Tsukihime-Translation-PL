---Suddenly, I wake up.
<Page2>
Without anyone waking me up,
Without hearing anything, 
Vaguely without any reason,# I wonder when was the last time I woke up in the middle of my sleep.
<Page3>
I feel like I have forgotten something, so I sit up restlessly.
<Page4>
I feel my heart pounding, so I leave the room, curious about what is going on outside.
<Page5>
I am thirsty, so I go down the hallway in search of water.
<Page6>
A long, moonlit corridor.
The sounds of the night when the inhabitants are asleep.
......Nostalgic.
I'm sure I've walked down a path like this before.
I wander aimlessly down the stairs.
<Page7>
It was a blind spot in the the mansion.
The staircase not only connects the first floor to the second floor, but on the other side of the staircase, there is a secret passage that leads to the attic.
<Page8>
It has long since been forgotten, even by the residents.
The attic of the mansion, once used as a warehouse, has not been accessed by anyone for several years.
<Page9>
Even though it was October, it was as cold as the middle of winter tonight.
Searching through the luggage for a blanket.
An old chest of drawers is catching my eyes, and so I open it.
<Page10>
"------"
It's just a bunch of small, insignificant things inside.
The drawer is completely empty.
<Page11>
I feel disappointed, as if I opened a treasure chest and would only find a few pebbles scattered inside.
There are badges, accessories, binoculars, and other miscellaneous items collected by children lying around.
Among them, only one thing clearly stands out.
<Page12>
It is a dirty bandage stored in a transparent plastic case.
It's neatly rolled up, but it's too old to be of any use.
There's nothing here.
Closing the drawer, I decide to go back to my room.
<Page13>
On my way out.
For no apparent reason, I notice that my cheeks are wet.
Maybe.
Maybe I used this place when I was a kid.

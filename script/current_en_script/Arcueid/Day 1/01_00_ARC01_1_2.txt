Suddenly, a question crossed my mind.
Why is she riding the train this early in the morning?
<Page2>
"But why? 
Senpai, you're not a member of any club. Why go to school at this hour?"
<Page3>
"Well, what do I have to hide? I'm on my way back from volunteer activities.
You see, the student council asked for volunteers to pick up trash in the park, right?
That's what I was doing until just now."
<Page4>
When she said that, I went, "Ah" and it all made sense to me.
Senpai is the kind of person who's always working hard for someone else.
<Page5>
"It was just an early morning volunteer activity for 30 minutes.
Everyone else had already gone home, but I thought I'd just go back to school since it was too much trouble."
Senpai's bag made a clanking sound.
I thought it was a tool for club activities, but it seems to be a cleaning tool.
<Page6>
"Oh, do you want to see what's inside? You're so bold to check out your Senpai's belongings, even though you look so quiet."
<Page7>
Senpai leans in closer, as if staring into my face.
...No, her face, her smell and so many other things are so close that I'm not even sure where to look.
<Page8>
"No, no, it's not that, I mean if you have a foldable broom or a rake, that would be unusual...."
<Page9>
"Hoh hoh, I see you also want to see my pruning shears.
All right. Then come by tea ceremony club after school. You're more than welcome."
<Page10>
I felt embarrassed when she said that with a soothing smile.
Not being able to give a witty reply, all I can say is a weak "yes".
<Page11>
"It's a promise then. Between you and me, we have a surplus of tea cakes purchased with club funds. It's not something that lasts long, so I need a healthy boy to help out."
"I-is that so? Well, if my schedule permits, then by all means.
Although getting taken in by food is something a cat would do."
<Page12>
Ciel-senpai's smile was so friendly that I couldn't help but joke a little.
<Page13>
And then, the senpai in a green ribbon replied.
"It's more like a dog, I think.
I mean, felines are not good. The ones you can rely on to the end are the disciplined and intelligent canines!"
She looked pleased with herself, and showed a determination that I couldn't quite understand.
<Page14>
Because our destinations were the same, the conversation somehow continued.
Like about the midterm exams that ended last week.
Or about the sports festival, which had been scaled down and ended in a day.
Or about the cafeteria, where the menu has never changed.
After discussing the controversy between the school and the students who want to restrict the use of mobile devices nowadays, we both sigh and change the subject, laughing about our impressions on recent movies.
<Page15>
Fifteen minutes soon passed.
Senpai was a good conversationalist, and rumors has it that she is "well liked by both men and women".
<Page16>
I regretted that we'd get to Souya Station in a few minutes, so I asked her what she wanted to talk about next.
---But.
<Page17>
"......Hey, you're making too much noise."
Just like that, we were unaware of our surroundings.
We both bowed our heads to apologize.
"..............."
<Page18>
"......We've made her angry."
"......Sorry .
I was laughing too loud, I guess."
<Page19>
After that, the conversation ended.
It's as if the friendly atmosphere from earlier was a lie.
Everyone is a stranger again, and the silence peculiar to the city dominates the train.
<Page20>
The train arrived at Souya Station.
It was just before 7 am.
It was a little early for school, and the town was still asleep.
It is quiet in front of the station now, but in an hour, it will be overflowing with people and cars.
<Page21>
"There's not much traffic this morning either. It seems like the town is waking up late these days. I wonder if everyone is staying up late.
Carrying a heavy load, senpai said something strange.
<Page22>
"Um. That luggage, do you need help carrying it to school?"
Eh? Ah, no, no, don't worry about it. I have to stop by somewhere, so I'll leave you here."
<Page23>
And so, waving her hands with a smile, Senpai ran off.
It was such a light and fast run that an onomatopoeic sound like "Babyun" would be appropriate.
I felt like running along with her, but there was no reason to hurry.
I headed to school at a normal pace, since I have my body condition to worry about.
<Page24>
.......And then.
The girl from earlier came out of the ticket gate.
<Page25>
She walked past me at a fast pace.
"You're as frivolous as you look, aren't you? I'm disgusted."
and left behind a strong comment.
<Page26>
"------"
I was stunned on what suddenly happened.
Apparently, I offended her.
<Page27>
From now on, I'll be more careful when talking in the train.
I may have unintentionally uttered a word that made people uncomfortable.
<Page28>
Well, even if you take that into account,
"...... No, middle school students these days are intimidating."
Giving such harsh critique just passing by, it's like a samurai executing casually a peasant.

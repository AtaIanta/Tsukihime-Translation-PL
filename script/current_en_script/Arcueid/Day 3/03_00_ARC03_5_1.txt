...... This is a bad dream.
But why is the smell of blood is so real?
<Page2>
"......No."
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's not like I killed her.
Or did I kill her?
<Page3>
But there's no reason.
No, I know exactly why.
When I looked at her, I could only think of one thing.
<Page4>
"I ----.
Yes, I...
Tohno Shiki wanted to kill that girl.
<Page5>
That was all I could think about at that time.
I just didn't try to put that image into words because my head was in mush.
<Page6>
"Nn----o"
The smell of blood was making me nauseous.
"Ug---gh"
Stuff in my stomach, it's coming back.
<Page7>
"Ah... ah.
The vermilion color seeps into my eyeballs.
Dizziness that shakes my brain.
I knelt down in a sea of red blood.
<Page8>
"Go--bo--
Gastric reflux.
I threw up everything in my stomach.
I threw up all the food and gastric juice as I cried.
<Page9>
There is nothing left in my stomach.
And yet, my body forces me to vomit, as if it wants to pretend that what had happened never happened and to return to my normal daily life.
<Page10>
"Gob----ahh"
It hurts.
It hurts, like my insides are burning.
I couldn't stop crying and my body crumbled to the ground like a piece of garbage.
<Page11>
Her body was stained red.
It was painful and red, like watching a dream.
<Page12>
I couldn't stop crying.
I was terribly sad that I had killed a person.
...... No, that's not it.
I was sad that I killed her as easily as I killed a doll, without meaning, without mercy.
<Page13>
---I don't understand.
I don't know why I'm feeling this way,
I don't know why I killed her for no reason,
I don't understand why.
<Page14>
"---- it's a lie."
Because it doesn't feel real.
You see, I felt dizzy, like I always do.
It's just a dream that I saw while I was...
<Page15>
"---- IT'S A LIE."
I'm not sure how a single knife can tear a person apart like that.
I've heard that it takes an entire day of hard work to dismember a single human being, even with a saw.
<Page16>
So there's no way it can be done with just a knife like this.
In the first place, there is no such thing as a "line" , it's just a fantasy that I have in my mind.
<Page17>
It's a ---- lie.
Gastric juices dripping from lips.
My mouth, from the chin down, is sticky with stomach fluids.
The gastric juice has a vermilion color.
There is nothing to vomit, but the stomach is peristaltic, and the esophagus and throat are bleeding.
<Page18>
It......hurts...
It hurts.
So I'm sure.
This isn't a dream, I'm lying to myself.
<Page19>
"It's... it's all a lie."
Yes, I really do understand.
I was lusting. I was excited to see this girl.
<Page20>
It's the same with my eyes.
If I knew that those "lines" would cut things like cutting paper.
I must have understood that humans can be easily torn apart.
I just lived irresponsibly, without thinking about it.
<Page21>
...... If I am a dangerous person who can easily kill anyone.
I should have blinded myself or lived a life where I never saw anyone.
<Page22>
"...... I'm sorry, Sensei."
---I'm really, really sorry.
I couldn't even protect such a simple thing. ----
<Page23>
Am I... still sane?
I don't know. The impulses that had arisen earlier are no longer there.
<Page24>
But at that time, I couldn't even think of enduring or bearing it.
I'm going to kill her.
I was thinking and doing such things as a matter of course.
<Page25>
...... Then the answer is simple.
I'm sure I'm crazy.
It was probably seven years ago.
I was miraculously revived from an accident that should have killed me.
From the moment I was miraculously revived, -------

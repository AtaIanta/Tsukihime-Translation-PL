Fifth period.
The study of ancient Japanese literature is making me sleepy, but I continue writing in my notebook.
Our high school has not yet approved the use of electronic devices for notetaking. The school has said that they will eventually move to using tablets, but it seems to be a few years away.
<Page2>
However, the use of mobile devices in class is not discouraged. It's an unspoken agreement.
Even now, some students use their cell phones to read dictionaries, some to exchange e-mails, and some to browse web sites.
I'm more of an analog person, so I write the contents of the class by hand like an old-fashioned student.
<Page3>
"----"
It comes suddenly.
A sharpening of consciousness akin to acceleration.
A perspective that flips, twists, and flutters toward a point.
A sense of equilibrium as if my brain itself is spinning in circles.
<Page4>
My vision wavers.
I feel that something is coiling at the back of my head, and that my consciousness is about to tumble out of my skull.
<Page5>
"This..."
I know this feeling.
Sudden dizziness is a precursor of anemia.
...... I let my guard down. I knew this could happen to me at any time, but I let my guard down.
<Page6>
I hate this ...... It's not every day you collapse in class. ----
<Page7>
In the darkening vision, I grope for my desk and grab it. I lean on it.
But it's all for naught.
I can't put any strength into my fingertips.
All that's left is for me to fall to the floor...
<Page8>
"Sir, may I have a word?"
---And then....
He slaps me roughly on the back.
<Page9>
"Tohno's not feeling well, so I'd like to take him to the infirmary."
Before I knew it, Arihiko has arrived.
"Tohno, are you sick?"
I hear the teacher's voice from the podium.
<Page10>
"No, I'm fine like this---"
"Oh, no, he's not fine at all
Shouldn't you send him home early?"
...... Arihiko is talking loudly and selfishly.
<Page11>
"Is that so. The doctor has told me about Tohno's condition too. Tohno, If you're not feeling well you can rest in the infirmary or leave early and go home."
......Maybe there are good people in this world too.
The literature teacher seems to believe Arihiko's point.
<Page12>
"Look, you can go home. Don't look so pale, if you think something is wrong, you should tell me right away."
Arihiko pats me on the back grumpily.
"...... I'm going to leave early then, sensei."
"Hmm," nodded the literature teacher.
<Page13>
"...... My bad, Arihiko. I'm sorry I caused you to worry so much."
"Don't worry about it. I've known you since middle school, and I can tell right away when you're about to collapse from anemia.
<Page14>
Arihiko goes back to his seat.
I manage to get up from my seat and leave the classroom with a heavy feeling in my body.
<Page15>
I leave the school building.
I thought about going to the infirmary to rest, but at this hour there was a high possibility that I would fall asleep until nighttime.
I decided that it would be better to push myself a little and go back to the mansion.
<Page16>
"Fu ...... I think it's getting a little better."
As I breathed in the fresh air, I began to feel better.
<Page17>
Seven years ago.
Perhaps it was the price of recovering from an accident that almost took my life, but since then, I've developed a constitution that leads to chronic anemia.
<Page18>
When I was first discharged from the hospital, I feel ill with anemia every day.
Because of my constitution, I missed many things, but thanks to the people around me, nothing serious ever happened.
<Page19>
Now that my body has grown, I don't get anemic attacks as long as I don't recklessly strain myself.
Even so, there are times when I get dizzy and lose consciousness.
Today I was lucky that Arihiko caught me, but normally I would have fainted.
<Page20>
"------"
I take a slow, deep breath, letting the fresh air fill my lungs.
Holding back the stagnation that has settled in the middle of my head, I leave the school.
<Page21>
I walk out onto the street in front of the station.
...... I can't believe it. This proves that I'm still in a daze.
I almost went into the ticket gate out of habit.
<Page22>
The place I'm going to is not Arima house. It's Tohno mansion. There's no need to take the train from here anymore.
<Page23>
"----"
I'm still not feeling well.
I put my hand on my forehead, and it is hotter than usual.
<Page24>
If I push myself too hard and fall on the side of the road, there is nothing I can do.
"...... I can't help it, really."
I sit down on a bench, disgusted with myself.
I'm going to take a break until I feel better.

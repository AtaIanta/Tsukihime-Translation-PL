Before HR.
The classroom was more lively than usual.
<Page2>
The boys and girls were having a silly arguments about Noel's evaluation.
Fortunately, I didn't belong to either camp. So, I walked across the classroom to my seat without a care in the world and found ......
<Page3>
"Hey. You're late, Tohno."
My seat by the window was occupied by a man who didn't belong in a morning classroom, waiting for me with a smirk on his face.
What's more,
<Page4>
"Good morning, Tohno-kun."
He was accompanied by an unexpected person.
<Page5>
"Senpai? Why are you in my classroom?
<Page6>
"Oh, is it so unusual? I just dropped by to see if you were in class."
"That's unusual. Normally, senpais don't come to lower classes. It's embarrassing to be in the underclassmen's class."
<Page7>
"Is that so? Tohno-kun, you're rather thoughtful about details. But I'm fine with it. We're all from the same school."
What philanthropy, I can't even speak.
<Page8>
"No, but third and second year classrooms are still too far apart... and you'll be late for HR if you don't go now."
She nodded earnestly.
<Page9>
"Don't worry about that. I'm a fast runner, despite my appearance. It takes me less than a minute to get to my class downstairs."
Senpai was proud of herself.
"............"
She was tough, mentally and physically.
<Page10>
"You talk too much, Tohno.
It's fine, she came here because she wanted to..."
<Page11>
Arihiko, for his part, is sitting on someone's desk, chatting happily with senpai.
<Page12>
"......... Okay. But you have to go back to your class, two minutes before HR starts, Senpai."
I sit down on my chair with a sigh, feeling really tired.
<Page13>
"...... Inui-kun, Tohno-kun doesn't seem to be in a good mood."
"...... Yeah, I think that he's having a temper tantrum because he doesn't like living in a new place. Tohno doesn't mind most things, but he has a bad habit of lashing out when he doesn't understand something."
<Page14>
"...... Is that so? He doesn't seem like the type be very angry.
<Page15>
"...... No, this is not true. Tohno looks calm, but when he explodes, he explodes. Rather often. With a crack."
"......, huh. Crack?
<Page16>
"...... Yeah, yeah. Once he loses his temper, he'll lose all sense of control, so don't trust him, even if you're his senpai."
...... They are talking in secret.
<Page17>
"...... You know what? If you want to talk in private, can you do it in the hallway? I can hear what you're saying at my desk, and it's giving me a headache."
"No way!! you heard me Tohno!"
<Page18>
...... I heard you.
He even pretended to be talking in private and approached Senpai, and casually extended his hand to her waist, only to be struck down by her merciless hand.
I felt depressed before getting angry at such a blatantly theatrical performance.
<Page19>
In the meantime, Senpai was hiding her mouth with her hand, I wonder how serious she really is.
...... She might have thought that she was really talking in private.
<Page20>
"Oh, that's why you're a liberal arts glasses guy. Listening to me and my senpai talking about our love affair is beyond pathetic. .......#Hmm, are you that frustrated everyday? Is your new sister that beautiful? Can you introduce her to me next time?"
"Arihiko, are you trying to start a fight with me?
<Page21>
"Of course not. You and I are great friends! I'll fight with my parents if I don't like them, but I won't fight with my best friend because that's what I believe in. Basically, I'm a man who lives by chivalry."
<Page22>
That's great.
In his head, chivalry means that its okay to raise your hand against your own flesh and blood.
<Page23>
"I see. That's a rotten policy you've got there."
"Hey, you're pretending to be down, but you're really the same old Tohno! I'm sorry I was so worried about you!"
Bang, bang, my self-proclaimed best friend pats me on the back.
<Page24>
"...... You've been watching out for me, haven't you?"
"Don't ask such a silly question.
Isn't it noble to do such things casually?
He pats me on the back.
...... We've known each other for a long time, but I still can't get the full measure of his personality.
<Page25>
"So, how's the new house?
It looks like you're under a lot of stress. #Well, I don't know. At any rate, I had a strange dream last night, and when I told them about it, the people in my house didn't believe me."
"Hmm. Well, that's unfortunate."
Arihiko makes a serious face and nods his head.
<Page26>
"…………………"
---and
I thought she was silent, but she was staring intently at me and Arihiko as we were having a small conversation.
<Page27>
"Senpai?"
"Tonho-kun, you're really close with Inui-kun, aren't you?"
"Are you serious, Senpai? If you think so after seeing that, your glasses aren't properly adjusted."
<Page28>
That's not true. Tohno-kun, you're careless when you're in front of Inui-kun. You're defenseless and trust him completely.
For some reason, Senpai smiled happily.
"?"
She looks at Arihiko and nods her head.
<Page29>
"I envy you. I admire having friends who can understand each other like that without any hesitation."
I'm impressed.
""Is that so?""
Senpai looks at Arihiko and frowns.
<Page30>
"And, it's about time. I'm going back, Tono-kun, did you see the news this morning?"
"Oh, ...... I've been so busy I forgot. I haven't seen it yet."
<Page31>
"I see. Well then, let me ask you, there was a mansion on the news this morning. Was that your house?"
"Huh?"
<Page32>
I remember Hisui saying that the police had come to question us.
<Page33>
"Oh, it might have something to do with my house.
I heard that the police came to talk to us this morning."
"I see. Tohno-kun, don't play around too much at night."
<Page34>
Senpai quickly walks away.
We watch her walk away in silence.
<Page35>
"Mm-hmm... Now, Tohno..."
"What is it? I won't answer you if it's something stupid."
"It's not stupid. The big question is, when did you become so close to Senpai that she started coming to see you."
<Page36>
"It's hard for me to answer that question. We've only started talking recently, and today was just a whim, wasn't it?
I mean, you seemed friendly with her too."
"Not really. It took seven days for her to remember my name."
<Page37>
"Oh, that's unusual. Isn't it your policy not to deal with women who don't fall for you in a day because they're a pain in the ass?
<Page38>
"With most women, yes. But not Senpai.
I've been keeping it a secret, but the truth is, I prefer..."
You're saying you like Senpais who look good in glasses?
Arihiko's cheeks flushed.
<Page39>
"Do you get it, buddy?"
I know. It's a bit of a stretch, but Senpai said we're best friends. I can tell when you're serious or not.
She's really cute. You can't talk to her and not like her. I'm the same."
<Page40>
"I see, I see.
So you understand how great she is as well,――― #But, what are you trying to say?"
"If we are best friends, we will get along with each other and have similar interests. It's not surprising that the types of girls you like are also similar."
<Page41>
We look at each other for a while.
Finally, Arihiko nods seriously and says,
"It was a short friendship, Tohno."
"Yeah, it was."
I see Arihiko off with a wave of hand.
At the same time, the chime for the start of homeroom rang out.

"------"
...... My neck is strangely hot. It's swollen and tender.
I wonder if that's why I feel like I've lost track of where I was going.
<Page2>
The night is covering the city like water that has leaked out.
The noise is incomparable to that of the morning.
The headlights of cars passing by.
Crowds of people being thrown out of the station, or being sucked in.
The number of school uniforms has dwindled.
And people in colorful clothes are strolling about.
<Page3>
"------"
I stood up from my seat on the bench.
It's time to go.
I had no reason to go there at all, but I headed downtown.
<Page4>
"------"
I turned off the main street into a side street.
Rather than a street, it was a blind spot between buildings.
<Page5>
There were no people around me.
There was no noise.
There was no sign of life.
Just a rustling sound coming from the back.
<Page6>
The light from the vending machine was dazzling.
The lights of the vending machines are too bright, too contrasty for this place.
It was too bright, so I walked past it.
I turn my feet to the darker, more appropriate darkness of the night.
<Page7>
...... into a narrower, more secluded darkness.
I put my hand on the rusty iron fence.
If I open it and go deep enough, I'll find...
<Page8>
"Hey, you there."
"Eh?"
<Page9>
I stopped in my tracks.
I woke up with a light spark of dizziness.
...... I don't know what is the meaning of this.
Why did I come to this place?
Why did I try to go this far back in ......?
<Page10>
"I'm sorry. Do you have a hundred yen on you?
When I turned around, there was a strange girl in front of the vending machine.
I've been trying to buy some juice, but I'm stuck without any change."
<Page11>
"..............."
Perhaps I felt guilty for trying to go further into the alleyway, but I let myself be carried away by the atmosphere and handed over the hundred yen.
<Page12>
"Thanks."
A hundred yen was inserted into the vending machine. A button was pressed.
The girl took out the can that had fallen out of the machine.
She frowned, looking disappointed.
<Page13>
"Taking a walk at this time of night is carefree, isn't it?
Isn't the lady at the house waiting for you?"
"Eh....Yeah ......!"
<Page14>
I looked at my phone.
The clock ruthlessly struck 7:40... Oh no, there's only 20 minutes left until curfew!
<Page15>
I rushed out of the alleyway.
-----
"Please, wait!"
The girl stopped me again.
<Page16>
"What? I'm sorry, but I have to hurry.
A juice can was thrown at me.
I rushed to catch it, but wasn't this the one she had bought?
<Page17>
"Have it."
"Um, ....... Why?"
"None of them taste drinkable."
<Page18>
The girl said grumpily, and strolled past me.
<Page19>
"No, no, this is no time to be worried about stuff like this.......!"
I hurry up and start running too.
Breaking the curfew on the first day is too bad for a brother, or even a human being. I have to get back to the mansion before the thunder of the head of the family falls. ......!

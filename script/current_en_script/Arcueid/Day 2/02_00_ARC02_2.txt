　It's after school now#.
I didn't feel dizzy from anemia today, and my daily life was quite peaceful, from my personal point of view.
However, an unprecedented virus has spread in the classroom, and until a short while ago, the air was filled with unrest.
<Page2>
The girls called it "Noel Fever"
or "Noel virus".
The confrontation between the boys and the girls did not stop until lunchtime, and the battle was carried over to tomorrow.
<Page3>
On the other hand, the boys who missed the Noel fever were praised by the girls' group, but branded as impotent, traitors, and childish girls by the boy's group. This is a rather silly story.
<Page4>
"...... Well, Noel-sensei, she's certainly not the type of beauty you see too often."
<Page5>
But I still don't understand why everyone is so crazy about her.
If you're talking about beauty, Akiha is much more ...
<Page6>
"Oh, there you are. Got a minute, Shiki?"
The person in the middle of it all arrived at an unbelievable time!
<Page7>
"Oh. You look like you're about to blow your heart out of your mouth.
Was there something on your mind that you didn't want to talk about?"
<Page8>
"No, no, nothing like that, not at all.
...... So... What can I do for you, Noel-sensei?"
Swallowing the guilt of comparing Noel-sensei to Akiha, I try my best to calmly divert the topic.
<Page9>
And ......
She smiled at me as if she could see right through me.
<Page10>
"...... Hmm. I like the sound of "Noel-sensei". It's much better than being called senpai.
I'm still getting used to Japan, so I'm a little nervous, but I think I'll be addicted to being called "Sensei" by a naive boy like you..It's kind of dirty and a little bit exciting."
<Page11>
"Um, Noel-sensei, ......?
You're a bit too close.....
<Page12>
"Don't worry about it. Or rather, you should pretend to and keep quiet.
Hey, look ............ My neck, isn't it beautiful?"
<Page13>
Was it the tension, or the magic of the setting sun?
Her voice slips into my ear, not from the front, but from right behind me, as if she were whispering in my ear.
<Page14>
"Don't be so cautious .
...... Just lace your fingers with mine. Transferring heat. Just entrusting my body
...... Yeah. I just want you to eat me. ......"
<Page15>
Breathing close. Our legs entwine. An arm is put around your back to block my escape.
---In my eyes.
The woman's neck is strangely glamorous and slippery.
<Page16>
"...... See ...... The heartbeat alone is making you melt. ......?
So forget about it, forget about yourself, forget about...... everything that's in the way, take it all away ......, the formalities, the glasses. -"
<Page17>
The snake-like fingers touch the frame of the glasses.
In a moment. My body jumps away from hers with only the fear of "not wanting to look".
<Page18>
"Just kididng, it was a hands-on commemoration of my new position ♡.
In Japanese terms, a little skin-to-skin? Or an exchange of business cards? Either way, it's still just a casual thing, don't worry about it, OK?
<Page19>
"...... You're kidding?, Noel-sensei ."
...... I don't think that's the right word for what happened now.
As a teacher, such a prank is too much....
<Page20>
"......What was the purpose of this in the first place?
You sounded like you were looking for me.
<Page21>
"Oh, that's all right. I just needed your help with something. I'm done with that too.
So, goodbye Shiki. Be careful not to end up like Toyama-sensei.
<Page22>
Noel-sensei waved her hand as she walked away.
I couldn't stop thinking about what she just said.
C:>About Toyama sensei..
C:>Keep quiet.

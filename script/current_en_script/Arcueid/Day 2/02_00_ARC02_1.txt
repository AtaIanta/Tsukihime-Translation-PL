Someday you'll learn that this isn't a dream.	
<Page2>
The things that you see in this moment, 
is a repeat of the past that has actually happened.
Or an introspection and self reproach
A refrain of both present and future, that borrowed the form of a lucid dream.
<Page3>
You do not dream.
I am not here even now.
Tohno Shiki does not know dreams.
I don't even know you now.
<Page4>
So, that's it for this story.
I'm still dreaming about the end.
<Page5>
Stars twinkle like falling snow.
As the waves come back and forth, the sea is rustling.
Like the waning moon, seeking your shadow.
Refrain, refrain, refrain, refrain, refrain......
<Page6>
"Good morning."
I hear an unfamiliar voice.
The deepest part of my consciousness awakens.
<Page7>
"It's morning. It's time to wake up, Shiki-sama."
......, so please don't call me Shiki-sama.
I told you yesterday that I feel uncomfortable when you say that...
<Page8>
"------nnnh."
I opened my eyes, picked up the glasses on the bedside table and put them on.
Immediately, the anomaly became invisible.
As if to escape the sluggishness, I lifted myself out of bed.
<Page9>
"............"
Where am I?
<Page10>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama."
The girl in the maid's uniform bowed.
"...... Oh, I see. I've returned to Tohno mansion, right?
<Page11>
"Yes. I know you were tired yesterday."
Hisui is standing upright in front of the doorway, looking at me as if I've just woken up. She looks like a well-made statue.
<Page12>
"........"
Perhaps it is because I slept in an unfamiliar room, but my consciousness is hazy as if in a mist.
"Shiki-sama......?"
Hisui calls out to me.
I buzzed and shook my head, awakening my sleepy head.
<Page13>
"Morning, Hisui. Thanks for taking the time to wake me up."
"Such words are unnecessary.
It's my duty to wake you up, Shiki-sama."
<Page14>
...... Hisui replies nonchalantly.
I feel a faint sense of unease, or a sense of regret, at this gesture.
If she were half as bright as Kohaku, she'd be a force to be reckoned with, wouldn't she?
I don't know, it's not my place to say anything about her personality.
<Page15>
"How may I help you?"
As if she noticed my gaze, Hisui looks straight back at me.
<Page16>
"No, it's nothing.
It's just that seeing your face made me realize that this is Tohno residence."
<Page17>
I got up from the bed and took a breath.
It is just before seven in the morning.
I woke up a little earlier than usual.
<Page18>
"I'll go downstairs after I change my clothes.
Should I go to the dining room instead of the living room ......?"
<Page19>
"'Yes, please come to the dining room. Breakfast is ready.
"All right. Thanks."
Hisui bowed and left the room.
<Page20>
I went down to the first floor lobby.
I changed my shirt and underwear, and put on my standard school uniform.
The dining room is a large room on the left side of the entrance to the west wing, directly opposite the living room in the east wing, across the stairs.
<Page21>
"Good morning, Shiki-san.
I'll have breakfast ready for you right away."
<Page22>
Kohaku-san was waiting for me in the dining room.
The reason why she called me "Shiki-san" was because Hisui had told her to last night.
Hisui was adamant about using "sama", but Kohaku-san seems to be flexible about it.
This also shows the difference in their personalities.
<Page23>
Kohaku-san serves the food quickly and efficiently.
It is purely Japanese style breakfast, following the "one soup, three dishes" rule.
However---
<Page24>
"..Oh no.... I should have told you yesterday."
"Oh, is there something in there you don't like?
Shiki-san, do you not like turnips?"
"No, I'm proud to say that I'm not a picky eater, but ......"
<Page25>
It is a bit too much.
I'm basically a small eater, and I eat even less in the morning.
When I eat neatly arranged food, I get sick in my stomach and lose my appetite.
I'm feeling good this morning, so I think I can eat half a cup, but when I'm not feeling well my chopsticks sometimes stop after one bite.
<Page26>
".....I've heard that you're a small eater, so I tried to be easy on you with this one, but ...... it won't do?
"I'm sorry. It's just the after-effects of an accident. ...... Oh, but I can tell it looks really good! This breakfast is absolutely perfect!"
<Page27>
I did my best to express my honest opinion.
Kohaku-san is not at fault at all, and I can't let my selfishness ruin the meal she prepared.
<Page28>
"Anyway, thanks for the food.
I'm sorry if I leave anything out."
<Page29>
"No, don't worry about it. I'm a expert in this field too. I'll make sure you get the right amount.
Then, please eat. If it doesn't suit your taste buds, please don't hesitate to let me know.
<Page30>
"Thank you for the food. It was very good."
I put my hands together and thanked her.
<Page31>
Kohaku-san's breakfast is perfect in both appearance and taste.
It is lightly and elegantly seasoned, but had enough of a kick to it to stimulate my appetite.
An average high school boy would have ordered a second helping without hesitation.
<Page32>
"But I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I left some of the food you prepared for me."
<Page33>
"It's okay, it's my fault for not asking about it first.
And I'm happy enough. Shiki-san, you really look so happy when you eat it. It's worth all the hard work I've put in for this day."
<Page34>
Kohaku-san smiles at me.
I feel like smiling too.
I think I'm the one who would be happy to see such a face.
<Page35>
"...... Oh no, it's already this late.
Please don't mind me. Go to the living room. I'll prepare for after-breakfast tea. If I monopolize you too much, I'm afraid of what might happen later."
<Page36>
Chuckling, Kohaku-san put away the breakfast.
It is 7:20 a.m. and I should be getting ready for school.
I thanked her once again for the meal and left the dining room.

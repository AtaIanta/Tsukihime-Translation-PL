"I'm home. ......"
I opened and closed the front door as quietly as I could and discreetly entered the lobby, announcing my return in a voice that was neither too loud nor too quiet.
<Page2>
The time was 8:00 p.m., one minute ago.
I ran as fast as I could from the front of the station and just barely made it in time, but honestly, it was so hard that I felt like throwing up. That slope is too much of a pain in the ass.
It was fine because it was downhill on the way to school, but I had forgotten that it will be uphill on the way to the mansion.
<Page3>
"Welcome back, Shiki-sama.
I know you're tired, but before you go back to your room, please come to the office. --Akiha-sama has something to tell you."
<Page4>
"Ugh, ......, the office, is it?"
The fact that Akiha took the trouble to call me into her office showed that she was in a bad mood.
<Page5>
"You're taking a detour because you have money to spare.
As punishment, I'll reduce your monthly entertainment expenses by about 20%."
<Page6>
And this was the punishment.
As soon as I entered the office, I was told of the decision without any room for explanation.
I mean, yeah. ...... From now on, I'll get my monthly allowance from Akiha....... And suddenly it's reduced......
Rejoice, father. Akiha grew up to be a much stricter master than you.
<Page7>
"B..But that's not true, is it? I came back before curfew, remember?
...... Well, I didn't make it before dark, but ......"
<Page8>
"Oh, that's surprising. You were aware that you made a promise to me. Then why didn't you keep it?"
"No. It's just, I forgot."
<Page9>
"Nii-san, I forgot to tell you something too.
As an added punishment, you will not have dinner tonight."
"Wha...."
<Page10>
What a tyrant ......!
This strictness is seriously frightening ...... just in this much time, if I broke the curfew, what would've happened to me?
<Page11>
...... I trudged across the lobby and headed for my room.
After that, I protested to the head of the family, but could not undo the punishment of taking away my dinner.
On the other hand, my allowance was only cut by 10%.
Taking her brother's dignity is a great victory for her.
<Page12>
"Shiki-san, Shiki-san."
"...... Kohaku-san?"
I was on my way back to my room when Kohaku came to talk to me.
As in the morning, she hid herself in a corner of the corridor and talked in private.
<Page13>
"Oh no. You can't do that, you have to come home properly at least today.
I thought you listened to me the first time, but you left too you early"
"Wait who told you that?"
<Page14>
"That's obvious. ......#No, no, it's nothing.
 Anyway, as a servant, I can't overlook the fact that you didn't have dinner.
So I prepared a light meal for you in your room.
It's just a simple rice ball and miso soup.
<Page15>
"……!"
What a thoughtful maid you are ......!
I'm sure she'll be scolded if Akiha finds out about the phone in the morning, but I can't believe she's so considerate. ......
<Page16>
"But you don't mind, do you? It'd be a huge help but. ......"
"Yes. It's about your health, Shiki-san.
Besides, Hisui has agreed to this. Even if Akiha-sama finds out, I'm sure she'll forgive us if we both apologize."
"I see, that girl's also ......
<Page17>
She was looking out for me.
It's easy to misunderstand her because she doesn't seem to show her emotions, but it appears that Hisui also felt bad about her "no dinner" treatment.
<Page18>
"Shiki-san. It's not that girl. It's Hisui-chan."
"Oh, yeah, I know. But since I don't know herx well yet, I feel bad about calling her by her name so casually.
<Page19>
"No, don't do that. It's a terrible idea.
Hisui is very kind in spite of her appearance.
You can call her by her first name as if she were family."
<Page20>
Kohaku-san is staring straight at me.
...... Surely, it would be difficult for her to continue to act like a stranger.
I'm sure she's just as concerned about me as I am about her, I have to be as lenient as possible.
<Page21>
"I understand. From now on, no matter what happens, I'll call her Hisui-cha.... No,saying chan is a bit too embarassing so I'll just call her Hisui."
"Yes, that'd be good"
<Page22>
Then, Kohaku-san went downstairs.
I join my hands in my heart to the nightingale of the Tohno residence, and return to my room.
Rice balls ...... It must be very tasty, since it's made by Kohaku. .......
<Page23>
"Well, that was nice."
I ate a rice ball specially made by Kohaku,
Hisui told me it was time for my bath,
When I came back from the bath, it was 9 o'clock in the morning.
<Page24>
It was a little too early to go to sleep.
I had only a reference book in my hand and nothing to read,
I'm not too tired today.
Rather than wasting time, I decided to go to
C:>Akiha in living room.
C:>Kohaku-san's room.
C:>Rest here.

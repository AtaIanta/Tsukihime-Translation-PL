<Page1>
No, I'll just stay in my room.
It would be a shame to lose this feeling of satisfaction by walking around, since my body is now nicely relaxed after taking a bath.
Then, with a thump I threw myself on the bed.
<Page2>
"Shiki-sama, are you there?"
"Yes!?"
I jumped out of bed in a panic.
I wasn't doing anything wrong, but I felt like I was being accused of a mischief.
<Page3>
"O..Of course I'm here. Please, come in."
"Yes, I'll be done right away."
<Page4>
"I'm here to make the bed.
I know it's unpleasant for you, but please excuse me for a moment."
<Page5>
It's not unpleasant at all.
It's a luxury to have someone make the bed in your room.
However, I had learned in the past two days that if I mentioned it, it would trouble her.
<Page6>
"Thank you. I'll be quiet in the corner of the room, so don't worry about me, please."
<Page7>
I moved to the corner of the room so as not to disturb .......
".................."
Hisui paused for a moment, then silently began and finished making the bed.
<Page8>
The bed is as clean and neat as if it were newly made.
"Your bed is ready. Excuse me."
Hisui bowed lightly and headed for the door.
<Page9>
"Ah, wait a minute..."
I stopped her to thank her for making the bed.
I had no intention of grabbing her, but I reached out to touch her shoulder.
<Page10>
In a flash. Hisui's hand was sweeping my hand away.
"Ah......."
I was surprised, but it was she who was even more surprised.
<Page11>
"...... Sorry. I was trying to stop you, I just..."
I guess I was feeling a little relaxed after the bath.
I felt like I was in Arima house, and I misjudged the distance between us.
<Page12>
"...... No. I'm sorry about that, too.
I'm not used to being touched. ...... Please forgive me."
<Page13>
Hisui's shoulders were trembling feebly.
I felt it was excessive, but I was the one who frightened her.
<Page14>
"Anyway, sorry ....... It's just, I felt like if I didn't stop you, you'd go."
Hisui would have stopped just by my call. But earlier, for some reason, I had a feeling she wouldn't stop for that.
<Page15>
"No. You have nothing to apologize for.
It's me who's at fault. I'm very sorry for offending you."
<Page16>
"No, you didn't offend me at all. ...... But I guess I was surprised. Hisui, you reacted so fast."
She reacted as fast as a kendo practitioner would be.
If this were a dojo, I'd be applauding.
<Page17>
"That's not what ...... I guess it's because I usually take care of the house."
Hisui lowers her gaze in embarrassment.
...... Good. It seems that she understood that I was praising her.
<Page18>
"...... I'm sorry about that. I forgot about your comment earlier.
What can I do for you, Shiki-sama?"
<Page19>
"Oh, nothing..."
It's hard to say "I just wanted to thank you for making my bed."
I can talk about anything at ...... Yes, that's right.
<Page20>
"I was wondering how Akiha was doing. Her school is a boarding school, right?"
<Page21>
"So you knew about it.
It is true that the school Akiha-sama attends is a boarding school. But, unusually, she is allowed to go to school from home.
"......, in other words.#You mean she goes to school from this house?"
<Page22>
"Yes, But she rarely comes home in the evening like today. After a full day of schoolwork, she has lessons to attend, so she usually returns shortly before 7:00."	
"What kind of lessons, for example.....?"
<Page23>
"Today she was learning the violin and a foreign language."
Today?..... Is she on such a schedule every day? She's been forced to practice a lot by the old man for a long time now, so it's probably not a surprise but.......
<Page24>
"In addition, until bedtime, the Tohno Group's business report for the day is given, and after waking up, until breakfast time, the details of the future businesses are confirmed."
<Page25>
"---Seriously?"
It was amazing enough.
Not only her mind and body, but also her lifestyle is made of steel
<Page26>
"On weekdays she returns before dinner, so if you wish to speak to Akiha-sama, please let Nee-san know after dinner.
If it is a holiday, Akiba-sama may be able to take some time off. I'm sure she'll be able to talk to you then."
"I see. Thanks, that was helpful."
<Page27>
Then, with a bow, Hisui left the room.
But even though...
<Page28>
"Violin lessons, company executives......"
The people who are actually running the business are probably the higher-ups in each department, but "all the decisions" in the end are taken by her.
<Page29>
"It's not a bad thing that I was in the office, huh?"
I felt a mixture of guilt and honest respect.
<Page30>
In my memory, Akiha was a quiet, slender girl who always followed me with anxious eyes.
But now, she's taking over from father, while still managing to live her life as a student.
<Page31>
"---Yes, I know.
People change a lot in seven years."
Just as I've become the Shiki Tohno of today in seven years,
Akiha must have become the Akiha Tohno of today in those seven years.
<Page32>
Seven years is a long time.
Roughly half of my life so far.
I wasn't in this house during the most important period of her life, when she was growing from a child to an adult.
<Page33>
"......, I'm really not a good brother."
I muttered to myself, as if to ridicule myself of the obvious fact.
Although it is unforgivable to regret it now.
I selfishly wonder if I could have eased Akiha's burden a little if I had stayed with her for the past seven years.

I'm going to visit Kohaku-san's room.
On my way to the washroom, I knew where Kohaku-san's room was.
<Page2>
I move toward the back of the corridor on the first floor of the west wing.
The direction is the opposite of the lobby, and the kitchen should be at the end of this corridor.
It seems that Kohaku-san has a small room in front of the kitchen.
<Page3>
"Kohaku-san's room is....... Is it here?"
I knocked on the door.
"Kohaku-san, are you there?"
<Page4>
"Yes, just a moment, please."
I hear a cheerful voice from inside the room.
After about two minutes, Kohaku-san came out.
<Page5>
"Is that you Shiki-san?
What are you doing at this hour?"
"No, it's ........ Actually, I was wondering if you could show me the TV."
"Yes?"
<Page6>
"Oh, you know, this mansion doesn't have a TV, right?
I've been living in a normal house for a while now, and watching TV before going to bed has always been a routine for me, and I don't feel comfortable unless I watch it. ......
<Page7>
The more I said ......, the more I realized that I was doing something incredibly cringeworthy.
It's really weird to go into a girl's room and ask her to show you the TV.
<Page8>
Even Kohaku-san's eyes were wide open.
<Page9>
"I see.
You've been living in Arima house until now. The atmosphere in this house must have been quite heavy all of a sudden, right?"
<Page10>
"Let's see. ...... Have you told Akiha-sama and Hisui-chan about this?"
"Does that mean I can come in?"
Yes, nodded Kohaku-san.
<Page11>
"No, I haven't told anyone."
<Page12>
"That's very good. If you had told me, I would have had to send you away.
She smiled and looked around the hallway.
<Page13>
"Fortunately, there's no one around.
Now, please come in so we don't get spotted."
She grabbed my arm.
"Wait, wawawa... !"
<Page14>
The inside of the room was quite different from what I had expected.
Half of the room was occupied by a tatami mats, with a large number of chests of drawers lined up in the back. This was the only part of the room that was completely Japanese.
On the other hand, the other half of the room was westernized but simple, reminiscent of a school infirmary rather than a room in a western-style building.
<Page15>
"Sit wherever you like.
I'll go make some tea."
Kohaku-san left the room.
<Page16>
"............"
I cleared my throat and sat down on the sofa in the wooden room.
<Page17>
This is the first time that I've ever seen a woman's room that looks like a tidy office rather than a girl's room.
The chests in the back had only small drawers.
They can only hold about as much as can fit in the palm of your hand.
<Page18>
"That chest, could it be ......?"
Isn't this a chest for storing medicines?
......I think so. When I was living in Arima house, there was a chest just like this in the room of an old town doctor.
<Page19>
If that's the case,......, then Kohaku-san is also a qualified doctor......?
No, I don't think so. She is too young to qualify as a doctor.
<Page20>
When I turned my gaze away, I found a TV remote on the cushion.
Kohaku-san may have been watching TV earlier.
<Page21>
"Yes, thank you for your patience, Shiki-san.
Here's some tea for you."
"Oh, thank you"
<Page22>
"No, no, I'm afraid I can't be as hospitable as I'd like to be."
With a friendly smile on her face, Kohaku-san served me a cup of strong green tea and some mizuyokan (a sweet bean jelly) as a snack.
<Page23>
"You came to watch TV right?
What do you watch at this time, Shiki-san?
"Nothing specific, but mostly it's news ....."
<Page24>
"I see.
I thought you would be reading after dinner, since you are so calm."
<Page25>
"Unfortunately, I don't have such an auspicious mind.
I'm often seen as a diligent student, but I'm a lazy one at heart.
I guess my glasses make me look sincere."
<Page26>
"Oh, that's right!
Oh, yes, that's right! You are wearing glasses, Shiki-san.
Actually, I was surprised when I greeted you yesterday."
"What? Why is that?"
<Page27>
"Because Akiha-sama never told me that you were wearing glasses.
I was prepared for a man with cool and sharp eyes, just like Akiha-sama.
<Page28>
My worries were unnecessary though, said Kohaku-san, smiling.
...... I see.
I've never met Akiha in person since I started wearing these glasses.
<Page29>
"But these glasses are everyday glasses.
I can say that my eyes have a problem, but my eyesight is better than average. I didn't lose my eyesight by studying too much. Ah I'm sorry I've ruined the intellectual image of me you had in mind."
<Page30>
"No, not at all.
I also enjoy watching TV more than reading books.
I'm glad that you are as energetic as I thought you would be."
<Page31>
"Oh, really? Thank you for that."
I felt embarrassed and averted my gaze.
Kohaku-san gave me a earnest smile right in front of face which made me nervous.
<Page32>
"Oh, sorry.
You came to watch the news, and here I am chatting with you."
Kohaku-san turned on the TV.
<Page33>
Images appear on screen.
It was little past 9:30.
The news program was no longer a cheerful one for the general audience, but had shifted to a serious tone, reporting serious information.
<Page34>
"Oh no. Another street murderer?"
The news featured a series of street murders.
It started in a neighboring district and is now being repeated here near Souya Station.
<Page35>
The story is simple.
"They indiscriminately abduct young women who are out late at night, kill them, and finally drain their blood."
The number of victims has already reached eight, and the police's ability to keep up with the investigation has been called into question.
<Page36>
No further details have been reported in the media.
The common characteristics of the victims, the exact cause of death, etc., have been blurred in the news, with only the phrase "blood was drawn."
I guess it's called "information control" to prevent copycat acts by amused criminals.
<Page37>
"It's a scary story. I wonder what the police is doing."
"Hmmm........the crime was so sudden that they couldn't pinpoint a motive? If it's a thrill killing in the middle of the night, you can't follow the trace unless you find it. Motivation ... You can't find the criminal with no motive.
<Page38>
"It's just bad luck for the people who were attacked.... No, you mean that the killer is lucky that there are no eyewitnesses?"
"Yes, well. Otherwise, it would be strange that the murderer was not found for almost two weeks.
<Page39>
"I don't know. If you're well-prepared, it won't sound so crazy, will it?
I can only imagine, but the more murders you commit, the more evidence you leave behind."
<Page40>
"If there are eight missing people, the evidence doesn't stack up, but if eight bodies have been found, there should be enough circumstantial evidence.
There has to a reason why the culprit is still not caught"
<Page41>
"------"
......That was unexpected.
Although it was inappropriate, I was impressed by it.
Whether or not Kohaku-san's speculation is correct, I didn't expect her to think so deeply about the details of the case.
<Page42>
"But that would make the killer a well-prepared murderer, not a spur-of-the-moment street thief.
...... If the killer is pretending to be a street thief and is going about his business in a planned manner, then the people who were killed may seem unrelated, but are they connected?"
<Page43>
"Well, no, I don't think so.
If there was such a connection, the police would have noticed it by the second person or so.
After all, this is a case of superhuman level of preparation in terms of concealment, but very limited in terms of objectivity, which is incomprehensible."
<Page44>
...... Kohaku-san talks about a disturbing topic with a smile.
Apparently, she doesn't really care about the incident.
<Page45>
"Kohaku-san, this is an incident that is happening in this city.
Don't you think it's a little scary for a young girl like you?
<Page46>
"No, it's okay.
Street criminals only appear in the middle of the night. If you don't go out at night, you won't meet them."
<Page47>
Kohaku- san's thoughts are very clear.
It's too graphic of a topic to be dismissed as such, but maybe that's just the way it is with incidents we learn about on the news.
<Page48>
"I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
If I want to see it again, I'll come back, and I look forward to seeing you then."
<Page49>
"Yes, I'll be waiting for you."
Kohaku-san looked around the hallway.
<Page50>
"As much as I would like to see you off to your room, Hisui is waiting for you, so I'll leave you here."
"Okay. Then, good night."
<Page51>
"............"
I didn't know that the bedtime at the mansion was 10pm.
In addition to the 8 o'clock curfew, there is an unspoken rule in this mansion that you are not allowed to leave your room after 10 o'clock.
<Page52>
"Seriously.... Father is gone, but she's still so uptight, isn't she?"
...... Well, that's not surprising.
No matter how much technology advances and fashions change, the Tohno family has maintained this way of life for hundreds of years.
Nothing will change just because Akiha became the head of the family.
<Page53>
"............ She's been rather good to me, hasn't she?
At least she didn't treat me like rest of the relatives."
<Page54>
...... I'm getting tired of the unfamiliar atmosphere of the house.
I think I'll go back to my room quietly tonight.

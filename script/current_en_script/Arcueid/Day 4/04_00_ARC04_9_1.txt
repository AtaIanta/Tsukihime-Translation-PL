<Page1>
"............ Okay."
...... I take a small deep breath and shake off my doubts.
I searched for something that could be used as a weapon, but there was nothing in the room that I could use.
I swallowed my hesitation, took the knife from my bag, and walked to the door.......
<Page2>
"---Shiki?"
"...... I'm going to check on him.
Don't leave the room until I come back."
I shook off Arcueid's gaze which was telling me that she wanted to say something and went out into the hallway.
<Page3>
The lights in the hallway were off, apparently there was something wrong with the electricy.
Only the elevator hall at the end of the corridor was still lit.
My throat hurts worse than when I was in my room. The air around me is rough and hot, like sandpaper.
<Page4>
The hallway is frighteningly quiet.
There is no noise.
Not a hint of human presence.
No ■■ running about.
No burnt ■■.
It is a tense, silent space that makes you want to think that the scene you saw on the monitor was a lie.
<Page5>
"There's nothing unusual here ............, is there?"
I walked down the corridor.
The sweat on my forehead is falling in drops.
It's so quiet, I feel like I'm a foreign object.
A foreign body.
It is customary for vermin that disturb the atmosphere of a place to be crushed.
<Page6>
"---,ugh---"
Once again, I take a deep breath to calm down.
I grabbed the knife again, wrapping my hand around the handle to prevent it from slipping due to sweat.
...... I feel nauseous.
Something in my temples.
The nerves seem to extend from the back of my eyeballs to my brain.
<Page7>
Are my eyeballs trying to get into my brain?
Or is my brain trying to swallow the eyeballs?
Biting down on the dull pain, I walk down the road in the intense heat.
<Page8>
"------"
It hurts.
My eyes hurt.
My head feels heavy, and I feel like I'm going to collapse.
Yeah, I know this feelings.
That's the feeling I get right before I collapse from anemia.
<Page9>
"Haa----- ah"
I want to live.
I can't take it anymore, so I take off my glasses.
<Page10>
The elevator comes into view.
It's a long hallway.
It's more than 20 meters from here to the elevator hall.
That's a long way, I thought.
Go back, I thought.
---Something.
A few more steps, and it'll be irreversible.
<Page11>
I hear a sound.
Disturbing the harmony of this clean, lifeless space,
The chime of an elevator bell.
<Page12>
It was so ominous that I stopped in my tracks.
My eyes stare at the uninvited object.
<Page13>
The lamp stops.
The box arrives.
I see a line on the elevator door far ahead.
No, that's...
It's so dense that it looks like a wall of speckles.
<Page14>
The door opens.
A narrow, iron box opens.
<Page15>
Inside the box,
It's oveflowing 
The flesh of everyone who used to be alive.
<Page16>
"------"
I stopped breathing.
Just as my brain refuses to think, my lungs have given up their activity.
<Page17>
The iron box called an elevator.
Red flesh tightly squeezed together.
Two dogs gobbling up the meat.
<Page18>
My vision turns bright red.
Red jelly begins to flow out of the elevator with a gurgling sound.
In a sea of blood, people, bones, brains, fingers, and organs.
The two black dogs were the only living life.
<Page19>
"Ah...,I..."
My reason refuses to accept this scene.
At the end of the corridor, inside the elevator, dogs are rummaging through people's bodies.
Through a gap in the elevator, a vent leading to the floor below.
A lot of screams that weren't there before are leaking out.
<Page20>
That is, if you listen carefully.
The sound of meat being chewed,
screams for help, and the screams of people who are no longer even speaking humanly.
<Page21>
My brain that is directly connected to my hearing <imagines/thinks>.
I can't see it, but it's in my head.
People being burned alive,
I see people being burned alive and eaten alive. 
<Page22>
A man noticed the unusual temperature. The moment he opened the door to go outside, he was enveloped by the eternal fire that had filled the room and died.
There was a girl who was locked in her room and crying. The flames that came up from the lobby filled the floor, and the girl turned to ashes in the bathtub like a burnt fish.
The adults rushed to the elevator as fast as they could. There were dozens of people in the elevator. The guests, who were no longer human beings, ate the people to their heart's content.
<Page23>
The screams were divided between fear of being eaten and despair of burning up.
No one was an exception.
Beneath my feet, in this huge box called a hotel.
There was a hellscape so close to me that I could feel it firsthand.
<Page24>
"------"
I feel nauseous.
But I can't throw up.
I know that if I do that I will become part of that red sea.
<Page25>
"Ha---a. Ha... Ha. Ha,"
I Resume breathing.
Biting down hard on my teeth to regain control.
<Page26>
The dogs in the elevator notice me.
I notice that the noise from downstairs had stopped.
<Page27>
"............ ha"
In other words.
That means there is no one left alive.
<Page28>
The two black dogs begin to run.
In this hunting ground, I was their last prey.
<Page29>
A black dog is coming towards me.
I can see countless lines on its body.
<Page30>
---And yet...
My paralyzed brain doesn't send me any instructions to fight or run.
<Page31>
The first black dog leaps.
Its speed is beyond that of a human.
The 20-meter corridor took no more than two seconds.
<Page32>
The black dog's mouth opens.
Its fangs, which were aligned like saws, came towards my throat.
<Page33>
Swift and precise.
The moment I realize it's coming.
The black dog's fangs made a gargling sound and bit into my throat.
Tohno Shiki was dead.
<Page34>
No... That's wrong.
This won't kill you and you won't die.
I don't hesitate when people are dying.
---- A hot summer day.
A long time ago, or maybe seven years.
I'm sure I've seen much more devastation than this. ----
<Page35>
Ah.
I plunged my knife into the head of the black dog that had bitten me on the neck.
The moment the fangs touched the skin, just before they bit into the carotid artery, my arm automatically moved.
<Page36>
I'm amazed at myself.
I wasted no time running the knife through the dog's eyebrows as if it were a machine that could only cut things.
Because that was the first dog's 'line'.
<Page37>
Normally, when an animal's brain is damaged, its movement does not immediately stop.
Muscles that have already received signals from the brain will execute the last possible command.
<Page38>
So if I tear the head open a little here, the black dog's fangs will bite my neck off.
Yeah, well... you know, normally.
<Page39>
But the black dog is dead.
Death is a stop. This thing lost all its power when I killed it.
<Page40>
The first dog falls to the ground.
The second dog replaces it and leaps at my face.
<Page41>
"------"
I plunge the knife into its open mouth.
The blade burrowed into it's flesh. The dog's outer skin is hard, but its inside are soft. It's bones and flesh are literally rotten.
<Page42>
But this was a mistake.
This thing's "line" is not on its face but on its chest.
If you stab him in the mouth, it's just a laceration.
<Page43>
The knife reached the back of the head from inside the black dog's mouth.
Naturally, the hand that held the knife ended up inside the black dog's mouth.
<Page44>
"------ Ah"
The black dog is still alive.
It's jaws are closed.
The cartilage, the soft joint between the hand holding the knife and the arm, is about to be bitten off.
The pain finally brought me back to my senses.
<Page45>
"Ah---!"
You've got to be kidding me. ......!
What the hell am I doing sticking a knife in a dog's mouth and letting it bite off my arm?
<Page46>
"This ---- .........!"
I struggled to pull my arm out.
The pain that grinds my arm sparks in my vision.
<Page47>
The dog's fangs have dug into my arm and I can't seem to get them out.
No, that's not the point. ---- The black dog was full of energy even though its head had been pierced.
<Page48>
The black dog shook his body and forcefully placed himself on top of me.
<Page49>
"......!"
I fall to the floor with a thud.
But I still can't get my arm out.
The black dog is still pierced by the knife, and yet he still puts pressure on his chin.
<Page50>
"Ah......!"
My arms are being ripped off...!
I can't believe it, no creature can bite something in this condition, a dog is ......!
<Page51>
"This...Ah ......!"
A wet and slimy feeling.
If I look at it, blood is spilling out of the black dog's mouth.
<Page52>
Is it the black dog's head that was pierced by the knife?
Or is it the blood from my arm that's about to be eaten?
To be honest, it doesn't matter to my confused head.
<Page53>
"Let go!"
Even if I try to escape, the black dog is biting my arm.
I can't escape.
I can't escape in the first place.
I don't have a choice.
I just want to stay alive. There's only one thing to do if you want to stay alive.
That is. Just kill it.
<Page54>
"------"
So what do I do?
One of my arms will be torn off in a few seconds.
That's the arm holding the knife.
I'm being pushed down.
Even if I can pull my arm out, the next instant the freed black dog will bite my neck.
<Page55>
"---,ha"
In that desperate situation, a Humorous smile came to my face.
It's okay. Look carefully first, then think carefully.
That's the lesson you've been following all this time, right?
<Page56>
You see. For example, you can see more than enough lines behind the dog's head.
This way, the way to survive is always simple.
<Page57>
"Gosh ----!"
So why do I Hesitate?
This is a violent animal. This is a man-eating beast of prey.
But this is a life so close, so suffocating, so beating.
<Page58>
"Ha, g---!"
The force of the bite on my arm grows even stronger.
Stupid. Too stupid. It's so inconsistent it makes me want to kill it.
In a providence where if you don't kill, you will be killed,
Why me?
Why do we humans hesitate thinking that it is a cruel act...?
<Page59>
A drop of red blood falls on my face.
The red blood dripped down my forehead and dripped into my eyes.
Vermilion seeps into the back of my eyeballs.
<Page60>
"Ah ----"
A vermilion color that scorches my vision.
Hot mucus that I've missed for sometime.
My consciousness went into a daze.
<Page61>
"...... Still, I..,
I can't kill something that's alive."
---What hypocrisy.
That's me.
<Page62>
...... Oh, yes, I did.
But not that time.
Tohno Shiki wasn't in his right mind when he killed Arcueid.
Even when he killed the first black dog, it had nothing to do with his own will.
<Page63>
But now it's definitely my own choice.
...... You said it yourself, Shiki.
Use this power with your own will.
<Page64>
That's why.
As long as I am who I am, as long as I'm a decent human being, I should never take a life for granted.
<Page65>
---That's hypocrisy too.
Because I did it a long time ago.
<Page66>
"A--------"
...... a bad dream from your childhood.
<Page67>
---Look, what are you waiting for?
<Page68>
...... It was a hot summer day.
<Page69>
---If you don't kill him, he'll kill you.
<Page70>
...... In front of me, the shadow of a boy covered in blood.
<Page71>
---You are already...
<Page72>
...... I have hot, hot, red blood on my hands.
<Page73>
I've already killed a man once.
<Page74>
"Aaahhhh!"
I stabbed it.
Instead of pulling out my arm, I buried it further into the black dog's head.
<Page75>
A cry of pain echoed in my eardrums.
The black dog's fainting resembled a high-pitched woman's scream. He was crying even though he couldn't wail properly with my arm stuck in his mouth.
<Page76>
I bet it hurts that much.
I don't care.
I plunged the knife deeper with the bitten arm.
<Page77>
The knife emerged from the back of the black dog's head.
It split the skull and cut the skin easily,
Blood and brains were scattered everywhere.
Incidentally, my arm holding the knife has also completely penetrated the head.
<Page78>
But Black Dog is still alive.
There's only one thing to do.
I reach out my other arm. I rip the knife from my bloody fingers and hold it with my left hand.
The dog's whole body rasps out a plea.
Its fangs relaxed as if in apology.
I don't care. #I simply dismantled the black dog along the line.

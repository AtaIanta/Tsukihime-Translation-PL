"What, here: ......"
A voice echoed in the darkness.
The air is damp. The smell of rot that makes you want to cry. A darkness in which she could not see an inch. All of it melts her intellect.
<Page2>
"What the hell is this place? ......"
I can't remember what happened a few minutes ago.
I can't even remember where I was.
<Page3>
I think I heard people's voices.
I think I went down of my own free will.
I think I used the elevator.
On the way down, I think I realized that this was not an urban legend, but the truth about the city that I really shouldn't get involved in, and I kept pressing the stop button desperately.
<Page4>
"Where the hell are we?
But that's already in the past.
Time is irreversible for humans. It is asymmetric. As long as there is no symmetry, there is no way to go back to the past from the present.
<Page5>.
That's it.
When she came, she was in the middle of hell.
<Page6>
"Ah...... ah, ah, ah......!"
Frightened by the darkness, she put her hands on the wall. Rotten juice clinging to her fingers. Fishy. Soft. Knowing that it's the remains of human guts splattered all over the place, you crawl your fingers, crying.
I can't go on unless I do.
I can't go into the dark.
I can't escape the sound of footsteps that have been following me since a while ago.
<Page7>
"No, no, no, no, no. ......!"
There was nothing to do but walk around with my face twisted into a crumpled mess as I scraped out the guts.
"Hee ......!"
Every time I move forward, I hear a exclamation from within the walls, like metal grinding together.
<Page8>
"Aah, aah, aah, aah, aah, aah, aah!
"Are you human?　Hey, don't go!　Don't go to ......!
"Mother. ...... Mother. ......
"Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out!
<Page9>
"Hii...... hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!"
It doesn't sound like the voice of the same creature.
It was a scream that made my throat and lungs burst. They shouted that they didn't mind that level of defect.
<Page10>
But their bodies were helpless.
Without limbs, they hung from the ceiling like cloaked insects.
<Page11>
"No, no, no, I don't want to die, I don't want to die. ......!"
I ignore the pleas of the things that are already done for and run away.
Light. Light. I just needed a light. Because then I could escape.
<Page12>
There is a goal, the people laughed.
Then there must be a way out.
It's the only way to save us. Even though they knew it was a lie, their remaining sanity kept them clinging to that hope.
<Page13>
"The light ......, the light, the light, the light ......!"
She turned her head back.
Then it occurred to her that she was not alone.
She must have come with her lover. That stupid man had brought this up. That's why I said I'd give it a try, just for fun. It's all his fault. I hope you die. I hope you die soon. Let him die before you. And then I'll be alive. I'm the only one who's gonna make it. Because I'm special. I'm special.
I've done nothing wrong. There's no reason for this to happen to me. This kind of thing is reserved for people who are more vulgar and dumber than you or more fortunate and lucky than you. I'm not involved. I'm not involved. I've lived a good life. I've lived a pretty normal life. I'm gonna live a pretty normal life. So it should be someone else who's going through this...
<Page14>
"Huh...? #"
The darkness ceases. The darkness fills in.
And in it,
she saw herself burning.
<Page15>
"What's this? ...... My hands are all torn up like ashes."
The arm she had stretched out against the wall was now only up to her elbow.
I looked down at my body in a panic, my clothes had long since been burned, my skin charred, my internal organs and flesh exposed.
The fat of the flesh was burning so red and flaming that it was hard to look at.
<Page16>
Good, she laughed.
Because...
I've finally got a light.
<Page17>
"Haha ...... I'm on fire ...... wow wow wow!
Look, I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire!"
A human laughing loudly.
A human torch illuminating the darkness.
Stab it down,
A blow of mercy to stab it down.
<Page18>
"Dada, dada, dada, dada, dada, dada, dada, dada, dada..."
She burned up, spewing boiling blood.
As if savoring the temperature, she drank down the fresh blood.
<Page19>
Hell reverted to its original darkness.
She finished her meal and crossed the hell without her lord.
Behind it are countless corpses.
The humans who wandered in and the dead who used to inhabit this cemetery are all turned to ashes in the flaming river.
<Page20>
""---It's cold here.""
<Page21>
Even the exhalations are smoky.
Leaving a red trail like a slug, it aims for the ground with a slow gait.
"The heart of the True Ancestor is in my hands."
In order to kill the coveted prey that his servants have just discovered.

---- I'm afraid for my life.
It reminds me of the scene yesterday when I killed Arcueid.
<Page2>
A time filled with the stench of blood and death.
I don't want to go through that again.
If I stay with Arcueid, the same thing will definitely happen again. If I don't want that, I'll have to go back to the mansion.
<Page3>
"------"
...... There's a big flaw in my choice.
Knowing what it was and what was wrong with me as a person, I covered my thoughts.
I'm not running away from this.
I'm just trying to get back.
<Page4>
"Let's go back to the ...... house. Then I'll be sure."
By the end of the night, something will have been settled that I don't know about.
<Page5>
"Hey there. Can I have a word with you?"
"What?"
Just as I was about to get up from the bench, a voice called out to me from behind.
<Page6>
"I don't mind if you leave me alone, but you look so pathetic."
<Page7>
There was a girl standing there, I don't think i've ever seen her before, but she also seems familiar.
She seemed to be a junior high school student, but she was not wearing a uniform. I wonder if she was bunking school like me.
<Page8>
"...... What's pathetic?"
"Your face. It's coloured like clay. That's what people look like when they die, right?"
<Page9>
"------"
That was a bad pause for a joke.
I couldn't just laugh and say, "What's that?
The girl was staring at me, not seeming to care that I had taken it so seriously.
<Page10>
"I'm not joking, I'm talking about my experience. The person I knew stopped breathing after three hours from looking like that. If I had called an ambulance, he might have survived."
<Page11>
The girl didn't come close to me.
She kept her distance of about a metre,
<Page12>
"Do you want me to call an ambulance?
Then lend me your phone. I don't want to use mine."
<Page13>
"---,
Ha."
A sigh of relief escaped me at this unexpected offer.
It seems that the girl was right, it was just malfunctioning without me noticing.
<Page14>
With the sudden return of daily life, breathing resumed correctly.
<Page15>
"No, I'm fine. It's just a little anemia, it'll pass soon.
---But thank you for calling out to me. Thank you."
<Page16>
"I see. I'll leave you to it.
...... have you been feeling bad?"
"?"
I said, and then the girl asked me a strange question.
<Page17>
"...... Well, I was born with it, I guess.
Ever since I was a kid, I get dizzy when I exercise a little."
"Hmm. So dogs are no good for you. I can't play with them."
"No, I don't have a problem with a walk."
I have no desire to own a dog, but it's sad to be completely denied.
<Page18>
"A walk.
You're still pale. I suggest you go home and get some rest."
<Page19>
The girl walked away.
"Hey, ......?"
As she left, I somehow felt that she was in much worse shape than I was.
<Page20>
In the end, I went to the park to rest up and then headed home.
The sun was setting and it was getting dark.
<Page21>
It was past seven in the evening.
The curfew of the house is 8:00, so if I don't hurry home, Akiha will give me a hard time again.
<Page22>
The streets around the house are as empty as ever.
Even though the sun has just set, it is as quiet as if it were midnight.
<Page23>
"Speaking of which, this place is ......."
this is the place where I came to check on the noisy wild dogs on the night I came back to the house.
<Page24>
"?"
　Right now, there's something in front of me, a black mass of meat.
<Page25>
"------"
　My consciousness froze.
　Why here, I wonder.
　Of course, I understand.
<Page26>
It wasn't just Arcueid who was found in the alleyway.
The people she was with were also trapped.
Didn't I cover my thoughts so that I wouldn't be aware of that fact?
<Page27>
As if to make up for the delay, I take out my knife.
At the end of the road ......, I backed away, keeping my eyes on the dead man who appeared from the mass.
At that moment,
<Page28>
---- strange.
Suddenly, the whole area turns red.
<Page29>
I hear a rumbling sound.
It's coming from somewhere very close.
My whole body is bouncing like a spring in extreme pain.
I'm bouncing again and again.
My consciousness, my body, my vision, the world,
My consciousness, my body, my vision, my world, are spinning like an emergency light.
<Page30>
Gurgling. Bang, bang. Rumbling.
The sound.
The sound seems to be coming from My body.
<Page31>
"■■■■■---!"
I fall to the asphalt.
I can't move my arms or legs. There's nothing left to move.
Only pain is running through my eyes.
<Page32>
"I can't even keep warm.
　I'm not even a dog that can protect my master."
<Page33>
I heard a muffled voice.
The sound of grease exploding on the asphalt.
Tohno Shiki didn't realize until the end of his life that this was the end of the filth that had been poured out of him.

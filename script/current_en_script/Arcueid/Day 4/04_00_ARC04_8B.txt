The night is drawing to a close.
Arcueid sits down on the bed,
I sit on the sofa and stare at the clock.
<Page2>
The time was a little after four in the morning.
It's only an hour before dawn.
<Page3>
"One more hour, huh?"
There had been nothing unusual so far, and Arcueid herself did not even seem nervous.
The hotel was completely peaceful.
<Page4>
...... There was a certain amount of nervousness, but that seemed to be overshadowed.
Somehow, I have a feeling that tonight will pass just like this.
<Page5>
"Hey, Shiki."
Arcueid called out for the umpteenth time.
<Page6>
"What the hell. We don't have anything more to talk about, here."
"Is that so? It's a shame we're wasting time like this."
<Page7>
"...... You know what? How long do you think we've been chatting?
Six hours, six hours. What's tiring is that I'm more tired from that than I am from being on watch.
<Page8>
Arcueid glared at me in frustration.
Yeah.
For some reason, Arcueid was talking to me a lot.
<Page9>
If you're weak, why don't you just sleep?
"Because it's more fun to talk."
The two of us ended up facing each other like this.
<Page10>
"......... Hah."
I really don't understand what this girl is thinking.
On top of that, I'm getting hungry.
If I think about it, I haven't eaten anything for a whole day since yesterday's breakfast.
<Page11>
"If you're hungry, why don't you eat something?
Since we're staying at a hotel, why don't you use room service?"
<Page12>
"No, it's not good for my health. You're the one who needs to eat something. You're weak right now, you should at least eat."
<Page13>
"If it's not okay with you, then it's not okay with me.
I'm not going to do it.
<Page14>
"A normal meal is something that is..."
...... Oh, that's right.
It doesn't look like it, but Arcueid is a vampire.
If that's the case, then sucking human blood is a "meal" for her too.
<Page15>
She said vampires need human blood to live.
So... whose blood has this girl sucked and how many humans has she killed until now?
<Page16>
"----"
I glanced at Arcueid's face.
...... I can't think about it.
It's been explained to me over and over that she's a vampire, but somehow I can't imagine her sucking human blood...
<Page17>
"What? Is there something on my face?"
"......!"
I look away in panic.
She stares at my face and then, 
She smiled meaningfully
<Page18>
"Are you curious?"
"What?"
"Are you wondering how many humans I've sucked blood from?"
"Mngh......"
<Page19>
...... She has completely seen through my thoughts.
She's in a completely different mood now. She is in full of joy, I really can't understand. 
 I don't understand, But I can't stop questioning how may people she has killed
<Page20>
"...... That's right, I'm curious. I'm working with you.
If I don't know that, I wouldn't be able to predict when you'd change your mind and attack me."
<Page21>
That's a real problem.
Arcueid was convinced.
<Page22>
"Then here a question for you.
How many human's blood have I sucked so far?"
<Page23>
With a thump, Arcueid leapt lightly from the bed and walked to the window.
<Page24>
"How many, that's..."
Arcueid smirked and looked at me with amusement as I fell silent.
It was an obvious provocation.
<Page25>
...... Sure, I'll give her a straight answer.
I'm sure this girl has killed...
C:>Ten people ......?
C:>A hundred ......?
C:>A thousand ......?

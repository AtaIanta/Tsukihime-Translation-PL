<Page1>
"I'm..."
At a loss for an answer, I look up somehow.
<Page2>
"......?"
Instantly. I see a pair of eyes.
<Page3>
"What the...?"
My slackened consciousness tightens.
The strength returns to my deflated legs, and I shift from a kneeling position to a sitting position.
<Page4>
Caught by my gaze, the woman looks back at the entrance to the alleyway.
There.
There was one creature that should not be in a human city any more than the woman who called herself a vampire.
<Page5>
"------"
The woman looks on unconcerned, but I can't keep up with her grasp of the situation.
<Page6>
It's a panther. I know that. It's an animal that even children know.
But that's assuming it's in a cage or in a picture book.
I'm experiencing firsthand how terrifying it is to face that thing without any walls in between.
<Page7>
Thin and strong limbs.
Flexible as rubber, but with muscles like steel.
The form of this creature is vastly different from that of a human being, and it is designed only to hunt its prey.
<Page8>
I am reminded of ancient memories that should have been truncated.
As a fellow creature, I stopped breathing in awe and fear of its superior athletic ability.
It is a fact that I don't need to verbalize---- there is no way I can coexist with this creature, much less communicate with it.
<Page9>
The black panther was over a meter long.
Even a dog, with its large size, could easily bring a human down.
But this thing, with its vicious fangs and claws, was staring at me and the woman in white just five meters away.
<Page10>
"Oh. Is that someone you know?
"Of course not!"
I couldn't help but snap back at the stupid comment.
<Page11>
---I really am an idiot.
With that voice as a signal, the black panther jumped.
No, it ran. It was just that its speed was so fast that I only recognized it as jumping.
<Page12>
"------"
There is nothing I can do.
The black shadow strikes its fangs into my shoulder without even making me aware of its first move.
<Page13>
I see it.
Even though I knew what would happen in a second, I couldn't avoid it or even think of avoiding it.
<Page14>
"And -----?"
But the impact came from right beside me.
Just before the black shadow took a bite out of me, I was flung away by the white girl.
<Page15>
And with one hand, carelessly.
As soon as the woman's hand touched my side, I was thrown to the wall as if I were a basketball.
<Page16>
"Ouch ......!"
I endure the pain of being slammed into the wall from behind.
<Page17>
"What are you............?"
"In front of you!"
<Page18>
The woman shouted.
I looked over and saw that the black panther had lost me, its target and instead of crashing into the wall, it had flipped around, put all four legs on the wall, and then leapt to the other side of the wall.
<Page19>
A black mass clings to the side of the building.
The black panther sticks to the wall and then turns its eyes back on me...
<Page20>
"------"
I gasped at the moment.
The trajectory of the black panther as it leapt from the wall was like a bolt of lightning.
Jumping to get in its line of fire, the woman in white flicked the lightning with one hand.
<Page21>
....... The frightening thing was that the woman's leap looked so effotless. The fact that it surpassed the speed of the black panther, yet still seemed "easy", struck a nerve in me.
<Page22>
"Hey, you remember the prior contract with me, right?
If you don't listen to me, I'll kill you."
<Page23>
Her attitude has not changed one bit.
The black panther growls menacingly and keeps a careful distance from the her.
The distance between them is about three meters.
The panther does not step forward from that distance. I'm sure he understood the difference in ability between the two.
<Page24>
That black panther is indeed a monster. A monster for humans. It only kills humans when they encounter it.
......, but that woman is on another level. She is a monster to monsters. If she encounters a monster then only that monster will die.
<Page25>
The black panther observes the woman without making the slightest movement.
This is a difference in power that even I can grasp. From the point of view of a wild animal that hunts, it would be like having a huge wall in front of you.
<Page26>
"I'll talk to you later. Don't get in my way-------#"
The air about the woman changes.
The expression on her face, which had been unfazed even in the face of the black beast, became noticeably more alert.
<Page27>
"What.........people ......?
They look like passerbys.
They slowly came through the dark alleyway between buildings, into this back alley.
<Page28>
"No, don't come ! There's a ...."
I was about to say, "There's a panther here",
when a red numbness flashed across my eyeballs.
<Page29>
"------"
I rub my eyelids with my glasses on.
Now, for sure.
I saw something terrible, something cruel.
<Page30>
They don't stop.
They have neither the wild perception nor the pride of a black panther.
They move forward without hesitation, regardless of what the white girl in front of them is, even if they know that they will be crushed if they take a few more steps.
<Page31>
Because "they" doesn't have a brain.
They don't have a fearful heart.
No matter how you look at it, they can't possibly be alive.
<Page32>
It's burning. Black smoke is billowing out of its eyes and mouth. And yet, it is moving like that.
<Page33>
It's dead.
That's a dead man.
Waste oil spills from his outstretched hand as if he were seeking salvation.
As soon as the spilled oil hits the road, it extends a tongue of flame.
From a distance, I understand that this is stagnated blood.
<Page34>
"What is this, a new species ......?"
The white girl was completely transfixed by that thing.
Three dead men, two of them reaching for the white woman.
The other one turned its head to me, who stood there dumbfounded, and looked into its burning eye sockets.
<Page35>
I was hit.
The black beast would not let such a fatal opportunity escape.
<Page36>
"......!"
A rush that surpassed the earlier leap.
This time, I couldn't even perceive it.
<Page37>
The black panther leaned over me as if to push me down and ran its fangs down my neck.
<Page38>
"Ugh, ......?"
My neck feels tight.
The back of my neck feels strained. I think it' s the back collar of my school uniform that is being bitten and pulled ......!
<Page39>
"AAAH!"
I was pushed against the wall again.
It was a corner of a back alley. I was taken violently into the shadows where garbage was piled up.
<Page40>
"Don't you dare treat people like garbage!
...... What am I doing?
I couldn't help but complain to the black panther that threw me there.
<Page41>
Fortunately, the black panther didn't pursue me. Perhaps he didn't have the time to care about me.
<Page42>
Raising his posture, he looked at the woman, hiding behind some scrap wood.
The dead people finally get within three meters of the white girl, which the panther never stepped into.
Instantly.
<Page43>
The atmosphere did indeed scream.
The airflow generated by the movement of the woman's arms was like the shovel of a bulldozer, obliterating the three walking corpses without a trace,.......

"------"
　I look down at what used to be life.
　The dog's jaw that had covered my arm was easily pulled away.
"---Hey. It's not biting at all."
<Page2>
　I look at the bloody arm.
　There were bite marks on my school uniform, but the gouged flesh was no more than a centimeter deep.
<Page3>
　A lot of blood is from the black dog that was pierced in the head by me.
　The pain of the bite was insignificant, but my fear made the pain feel many times worse.
<Page4>
"-----,ha"
　I lay on the ground and looked up at the ceiling.
　My head hurts.
　The world is full of splintered edges, and I can see the lines of death here and there.
　My hands and feet are cold, but only my reason is seized by a fever.
<Page5>
"---Ha, ha."
　Nearby are the bodies of two black dogs.
　One arm is covered in blood, the other with a red knife.
　...... and countless dead bodies on the floor below.
<Page6>
　I can't help but laugh.
　Because this is not real.
　This can't be real.
 I'm normal.
　I'm perfectly normal.
　What's wrong is this dream. Wake up and everything will be fine.
<Page7>
　But... when did I start dreaming like this with my eyes open?

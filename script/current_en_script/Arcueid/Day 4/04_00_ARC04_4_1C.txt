---I had a headache.
Small thorns bounced around in my eye sockets"...... Oh, no. You've wasted your energy again.""...... Oh, no. I''ve wasted my energy again..
It was as if they were trying to deny what they had just seen.
<Page2>
"...... Oh, no. I've wasted my energy again."
<Page3>
The girl looks back at me, her shoulders slumping.
She has no interest in the bodies that have just disappeared.
<Page4>
"It's all because you've been dwelling on it.
If you had decided sooner, we would never have been found!"
<Page5>
The girl walked up to me, casually.
The black panther had long since disappeared.
Maybe he saw what she just did and ran away, thinking he was no match for her.
<Page6>
"Hey. What was that just now?"
...... headache right next to my eyeballs.
The pain penetrating my skull is disrupting my linguistic cortex.
What the hell is this girl?
<Page7>
"You mean that? That was just a dead apostle,right?"
It's an enemy vampire's messenger. It's a bit unusual ......, and it's the first time I've seen this type.
"No, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about you."
<Page8>
A sharp headache tells me to come to my senses.
This girl is a monster.
A black panther out of place in a modern city and
An impossible burning corpse 
Even those are believable compared to this girl.
<Page9>
Creating a tornado by simply waving her arms?  This is ridiculous. As a fragile human being, there's no way I can live with such a thing for even a second.
<Page10>
"Me? I told you I'm a vampire.
Don't you know the word vampire?
I've heard it's common in Japanese books."
<Page11>
The girl gives an idiotic response.
I take the opportunity to strengthen my trembling limbs.
After what had just happened, the girl had moved away from the entrance to the alleyway.
If I run as fast as I can, I might be able to escape this time.
I take a deep breath.
<Page12>
"Wh......at...?
"----------------"
<Page13>
Just before I started running. I saw the girl's face.
This time, I really felt calm.
<Page14>
"Hey, ....... What's the matter, are you injured ......?"
"No, I'm not hurt. I never thought I'd be hit by something that slow."
<Page15>
"...things are starting to get a bit bad.
If this keeps happening, I'm going to have to ask you to be my shield, no matter what."
<Page16>
"---, what?"
Well, that's what I was thinking about. ......!
I was thinking it was a metaphor, but now I'm not so optimistic anymore.
This girl is seriously asking me to be a shield for things like a black panther and a burning corpse.......!
<Page17>
"D.....don't be stupid, you idiot!
You saw what happened, what can I possibly do? You're much better off on your own!
<Page18>
"Not really. I'm completely drained now.
I'm just barely alive, as you guys call it."
<Page19>
"------"
Oh, really? It doesn't look like it, but I guess it's true.
I'm relieved to know that violence like earlier was not inexhaustible, but a proper action at the bottom.
Ah no, that's not what I should be thinking about now. ......!
<Page20>
"I'm not sure what you are expecting from me but......I'll do whatever I can.
But I can't. I can' t, no matter what I do. I'm not strong enough to stop something like that. I'm sorry, but I can't even shield you."
<Page21>
"Liar. You did kill me.
Why are you lying now?"
<Page22>
".....Killed you.... but that......."
That was when I realized that I didn't know what I was talking about.
If I can be useful, I want to be useful.
But the standard of "useful" is too out of the normal.
<Page23>
"..................."
"...... Hmm. #If so, all you have to do is keep an eye on me while I'm asleep.
"You can do that much, right?"
<Page24>
...... I don't know why I feel so weak when someone gives me that look.
I...
C:>..will help.
C:>No, I will never cooperate.

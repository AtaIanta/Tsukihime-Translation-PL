　...... Let's stay in the room and see what happens.
　As long as Arcueid can't move, it's not safe to go outside.
<Page2>
"..............."
　...... Time is ticking away.
　Grasping the knife with one hand, I stare at the monitor that shows nothing but flames.
<Page3>
　Arcueid's eyes are closed.
　Her appearance reminds me of the beauty, or rather, the strength, of the moonlight earlier.
　More than half a day has passed since the incident in the alleyway.
　Her "power" must have returned to her a little.
<Page4>
　.......
　...................
　.............................. Hot.
　It's as if a flame is burning in front of me.
<Page5>
　Breathing is becoming difficult.
　I thought I was safe as long as I stayed in the room, but this means I'll be the first to fall.
<Page6>
"............"
　......Should I risk it and go outside?
　It's not too late.
　I'm trying to make a decision again,
<Page7>
　The light is gone.
　The mysterious high temperature phenomenon that had been unusual also ceased.
　At the same time,
　I heard countless knocks on the door.
<Page8>
"Shiki, are you ready?"
　I paused.
　Arcueid said that, in the darkness.
"What ...... am I supposed to be ready for?"
　I don't need to ask that back.
<Page9>
If it was a mistake to stay in this room,
was it also a mistake to ask such a question?
<Page10>
　I heard the sound of a door being broken open and look back towards the door.
<Page11>
"----!"
　A moment of panic,
　I had backed away from the door as a safety precaution,
 That was the definitive "why".
<Page12>
　Two dogs broke down the door and came in.
　Immediately after they were flung away by Arcueid's claws,
　An inescapable amount of fire was injected into the room, filling it to the brim.
<Page13>
"Ah-ah, ah-ah."
　As long as the temperature is not too high, a human being will not be killed instantly by fire. But this was a flame like a blunt instrument that could reduce a human body to ashes with a single blow.
<Page14>
　...... reminds me of how a flamethrower works.
　They look like they are shooting flames at you, but in fact they are literally "setting you on fire" by sending fuel to the target.
<Page15>
　This flame may be similar to that.
　The whip of flame charred the part it touched as if it were melting.
<Page16>
　There was no way a human body could withstand such a thing that could easily penetrate a table or a wall.
　The good thing was that the power of the whip blew off the upper half of his body in an instant, and I was able to avoid the pain of being burned to death by the flames.

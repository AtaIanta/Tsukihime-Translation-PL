　...... Arcueid is not going to give up.
　In fact, if she gets any closer, it's going to be a fight for sure. In that case, I'll definitely be the one who gets pushed down.

"Oh my god, okay, come on!
　...... Look. Return it as soon as you see it."

"Shiki. Is there anyone in this city who gave you these?"
"...... I don't think so. It was seven years ago, andd he wasn't the kind of person who stays in one place."
<Page5>
"Yeah. I'm glad I don't have to deal with more of them.
　...... It's probably safer to stay away from Blue, though."
　Arcueid fell silent with a serious face.

"Arcueid. You know who made those glasses, not the teacher ......?"

"I do. He's one of the four surviving wizards.
　Those glasses are an extraordinary piece of work. I'm not sure I could break them with my current strength."
　Arcueid's face grew more serious.

"......, were you planning to destroy them?"
"What?
　Did I just say that?"
<Page9>
"I knew you were going to destroy ......."
　Give them back," I said, taking the glasses back from Arcueid.

"Damn. You're the one who said I'd be insane without these glasses.
　Or do you want me to be like that, huh?"
<Page11>
"It's not that, but...
　It's just that I didn't like the way you looked at them."
"..............."
　I have no idea what vampires think.
This woman could've destroyed my lifeline.
<Page12>
"...... Just don't get any more crazy ideas.
　I can't live without them, even though the memories of sensei are important. If I see the lines all the time, I'm going to get headaches."

<Page1>
"Yes, it's a rather nice room.
I wouldn't complain about spending the night here."
<Page2>
Arcueid happily looks around the hotel room.
"----"
I'm speechless at this turn of events.
<Page3>
"So, what do you want me to do? Be specific."
"I'll move for now.
My room is not suitable for protection. ...... Well, let's go to a higher place with a better view."
<Page4>
And here we are.
Arcueid stopped a cab on the main street and drove to the next town.
She checked into a room at one of the most expensive hotels in the area, not just ......, but rented out the entire top floor. She was like an amazing celebrity.
<Page5>
"Oh, it's so tall!
Human building technology is really improving rapidly.
What do you call this kind of thing?　<One hair, one pile of gold>?　<daily progress|rapid progress>?
Well, it doesn't matter!　Look, look, look, Shiki, the alleyway we were in just now has become so tiny!"
<Page6>
With the closed curtains slightly open, Arcueid is enjoying the view from the window.
I'm not really in the mood for this.
<Page7>
This place is more like a fortress built on the top floor of a hotel than a hotel room.
The curtains that block out the sunlight, the furniture that decorates the room, and the materials used for the walls and doors are several times more luxurious and sturdy than those of most hotels.
<Page8>
Since we are renting the top floor, no other guests will come to this floor. If you look closely, you can even see a monitor in the room that shows the lobby on the first floor.
...... I realized once again that the people who use this room are a privileged class.
<Page9>
"Let's hide here tonight. Oh, don't worry about the accommodation fee.
I'm rich and I'll buy you a drink."
<Page10>
Arcueid said cheerfully as she moved away from the window.
She had already had enough of the bird's-eye view of the city when she said he wanted a place with a good view.
<Page11>
"...... Arcueid. What are you thinking?"
I sighed.
<Page12>
"What do you mean, I'm thinking about a lot of things."
"No, that's not the point.
I don't want to be in a hotel room with a person..."
<Page13>
I was about to say something, but then I stopped.
All I have to do is keep an eye on this self-proclaimed vampire.
I don't have to say anything else.
<Page14>
"No, no. Do what you want."
"That's weird Shiki.
You're so unpredictable, getting angry all of a sudden and then going silent."
Arcueid smiles, wondering what the fun is.
<Page15>
"............"
Meanwhile, I'm standing close to the door, watching the room without a care in the world.
I'm the complete opposite of the relaxed Arcueid.
<Page16>
I am exhausted and want to rest, but if I sat down on the sofa now, I would sink into the depths of the ocean.
I can't be that defenseless, no matter how much desperate I am.
<Page17>
"Shiki, do you want something to drink?　There seems to be a lot of drinks here!"
".................."
A brainy voice comes from the mini-bar in the room.
...... The bottle in Arcueid's hand was, needless to say, some sort of alcohol.
<Page18>
"You know what? I'm underage and you're offering me alcohol..."
I almost said it, but stopped myself.
I don't know if she's underage or not. I'm not interested and I'm not going to ask.
<Page19>
"I'll choose for myself later. More importantly..."
No matter how tired or bewildered you are, there's something you should ask.
<Page20>
What is the woman in front of you?
In short, how dangerous a situation am I in?
Even if these things are not in my common sense, I need to understand them to the best of my ability or I won't be able to relax.
<Page21>
"...... I have some more questions for you.
After that, I can relax and rest."
<Page22>
"What?　I don't mind, but what's the matter, you're all dressed up all of a sudden."
".................."
I've never been cocky in front of you,......, but that's okay,
<Page23>
"I'm serious.
What is your purpose?"
<Page24>
"Me?　I'm just after vampires.
Killing vampires is my role."
"Yeah, that's exactly what you said.
But you're a vampire, aren't you?"
<Page25>
"What, Shiki, you still don't believe me?"
<Page26>
"Don't worry, I believe you too much.
What I'm trying to say is, why would you, a blood sucking demon, kill another blood sucking demon? Theoratically, that's just not right."
"Oh, you don't like your own kind killing each other, do you?"
<Page27>
"I don't want you to, even if we're not related.
...... You know, vampires are demons that suck the blood of humans, right? You can't be a vampire.
What you're killing is the..."
I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you. ......?
<Page28>
"Bloodsucking and killing are two different things.
But I still understand what you mean.
But vampires are like endemic species that evolved differently from each other, even though they were derived from the same source.
They don't have the same sense of unity as humans."
<Page29>
"......?　So the vampire you're looking for is different from you?
<Page30>
"Yes, a different kind of vampire than me.
The vampire I'm chasing is a human vampire, so it's almost exactly the same as the illusion you have.
They suck human blood and use the people they kill to gradually increasing their power.
You remember the living dead, right?　That's what happens to people killed by vampires. Even though they died as humans, they can't die yet and are still alive.
<Page31>
"......Dead but Alive......"
　The corpse that appeared in the alleyway ......In the story of vampires, people whose blood has been sucked become new vampires and attack people.
　In this way, their numbers increase, and in the end, they turn an entire village into a land of death. ......
<Page32>
"Yes. That's the kind of vampire that lurks in this town.
　I'm not interested in sucking blood, and I'm not one of their kind. So there is no problem in killing each other.
<Page33>
　Arcueid says plainly.
　Apparently, there are many different types of vampires.
<Page34>
"...... I'm creeped out after all this time.
You're the one who told me to shield you from him so you could kill him.
<Page35>
"Yes, that was my intention at first.
　Even if you don't like it, I'll use you as a shield. Even if you run away, I'll tie you up with the mystic eyes and finish you from fear.
　But as I was talking to you, I changed my mind.
<Page36>
　...... So you were going to use force from the beginning.
　Okay, I'll never forget that,
"What do you mean you changed your mind?
<Page37>
"Hmm, I was wrong.
　Until you killed me and restored me, I thought you were from the Church.
　If that's the case, there's a chance that you have the location of the enemy and can be counted on as a force to be reckoned with.
<Page38>
"But Shiki is just a normal person. He doesn't know anything about vampires, let alone where the enemy's coffin is."
<Page39>
"...... Yeah, there's no way they'd send a representative to such an atheist country in the first place, and they wouldn't work <alone|alone> in the first place. A master and his apprentice in a two-man team is their basic rule. ......"
<Page40>
　Arcueid mumbles to himself.
　We're getting sidetracked, and I'm feeling pretty left out.
<Page41>
"Anyway, it means that my target has returned from you to 'the original prey'.
　I'm a little disappointed about that, though."
<Page42>
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　...... Damn it. There's still something on my mind, that woman.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm not sure what to do.
　The moment I let my guard down, I'm still going to kill her easily...
<Page43>
"Are you done with the serious stuff?　Then let's go to bed!"
"What?"
　And then, #with a bounce in her step, #she walked over to the bed and laid down on it.
<Page44>
 "I feel good, I'll sleep until the sun goes down.
　Shiki, you should get some rest while you can.　Vampires can't be active during the day, so it'll be nighttime before we can have a real watch on them."
<Page45>
"...... You. You know what I said about denying my own existence right now?
"I'm fine.
　---I think I've reached my limit. Then good night, Shiki. Wake me up when the sun goes down.
<Page46>
"Oh, hey."
"-------"
　Arcueid suddenly fell asleep, like a car with the engine turned off.
<Page47>
"----- Really?"
　I can't believe she's actually asleep. .......
　I feel like an idiot for standing so close to the door so I could escape at any time.
<Page48>
　Is that okay? It's not for me to say, but is that really what this person wants?　
　We're in a situation where we're almost forced to leave. We can get away with it now.
<Page49>
　No, to begin with.
　Even though I don't have the same urges anymore,
"...... I've already killed you once, ......?"
　So how can she fall asleep, this woman.
<Page50>
"....................."
　I stare at Arcueid's face.
　Her ample breasts rise and fall, indicating that she is breathing.
　Her body, lying on the bed, does not move a muscle.
<Page51>
　Sleeping like a picture.
　Gently closed eye lids.
　Long Lashes and pretty lips that look fresh even without red.
<Page52>
　The bulge of a well-shaped chest.
　The line of her waist like a hill that hazes the horizon.
　Her legs are long and slender.
　Innocent yet sensual, a contradictory word comes to mind.
<Page53>
".................."
　A woman like that, asleep and unprotected in a royal suite like this.
　I've only known her for a short time, and she trusts me, the person who brutally killed her, with all her heart.
<Page54>
"What an idiot, this girl."
　...... Yeah, I think she's so stupid and honest that I'm a little worried.
<Page55>
　Anyway, this is a base point.
　This may be the last turning point where Tohno Shiki can turn back.
<Page56>
　You'll be my shield, this woman said.
　But I'm ......
C:>...... So much for drunkenness. Let's run.
C:>...... So much for getting lost. Let's stay.

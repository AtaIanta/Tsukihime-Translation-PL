<Page1>
His chest is pierced. 
He bleeds profusely. 
It is as if the plug of the bathtub called Vlov has been pulled out. 
<Page2>
The scorching heat of the delusion is over. 
Stepping over the last boundary. 
With. 
With a scream that ripped through the world, the true face of the vampire appeared. 
<Page3>
The atmosphere creaked. 
The atomic activity switched from early too late. 
Electrons that have been bounced off the solidified ultracold fault and have nowhere to go react. 
<Page4>
The blue flames that covered the surface of the earth were not flames. 
That is a kind of heat lost from the earth, similar to vaporization heat. 
<Page5>
"Oh, really." 
Cold-blooded arms are held up. 
The outstretched palms of my hands, as if craving warmth and heat. 
<Page6>
"The world is cold. 
The entire body of the white beauty in front of me was swallowed. 
<Page7>
"------, huh?" 
It was not a 'drop in temperature,' but rather a change without warning, as if the world had changed. 
<Page8>
The river of ice that ran from Vlov not only blew away Arcueid, but also the city behind her. 
<Page9>
I didnt't know if I had two seconds to spare. 
The glacier reached the buildings on the ground and froze everything in an instant. 
...... What if. 
If there were still people in that building that hadn't been evacuated, he must have frozen all those people, snatched away the heat from them. 
<Page10>
It's impossible, he thought, shivering at the sight before him. 
I am terrified of what will happen next. 
It’s just a coincidence that I’m still alive 
If my location was in the same direction as Arcueid’s, I would have been frozen alive by now. 
<Page11>
The river of flames radiated out, but it was a slow disaster. 
The people were running away faster than the fire was spreading. 
But that glacier was only for a moment. 
The range is small, and the cold wave crawls on the ground, but if it is unleashed, it will kill you before you can escape. 
<Page12>
If he gets on the ground, what's in front of him will die helplessly. ......! 
<Page13>
"---Arcueid. 
Yes, Arcueid is at ......!?" 
<Page14>
I cling to my last hope. 
She's the only one who can stop that monster. 
<Page15>
"There she is: ......” 
In the middle of a river of ice, there is Arcueid. 
Thank goodness ......, come to think about it. She’s pretty sturdy too. 
Standing there in that cold air without even a scratch on her: ......! 
<Page16>
"...... That's what I mean. 
You weren't insane, you were running from your sanity." 
<Page17>
"Even a third-rate mortal can overthrow a star as long as he has the principle. 
It woke me up, Vlov Arkhangel." 
<Page18>
Arcueid dispelled the glaciers. 
Vlov stared at her coldly. 
Not with the sickly eyes of the past, but those that precisely observe their prey, like a hunter in the snowfield. 
<Page19>
"We're talking about the one that woke up, then that would be me....... 
How dare you take so much warmth away from me." 
<Page20>
It was a voice like a blade, filled only with hatred. 
The vampire's fighting spirit had not faded. 
...... No. 
In other words, for the first time in his life, he was ready to fight. 
<Page21>
"Yes. Then accept your good fortune, Vlov. Normally, I would have finished you before you woke up. It was the hateful murderer who saved you. Well, that's only for a short time now. 
<Page22>
".................. indeed. 
What I've heard of you, and what you are now, are far apart. 
...... Apparently, I picked up a lucky break here. 
<Page23>
"That's what it's all about. 
Both sides are in a state of turmoil, with only the final blow left to deliver. If one of them sets it off, one of them will just disappear. 
But first, I'll take the least you can do." 
<Page24>
"--- Answer me, my slaves of dwarf cattle. 
The testimony of the ancestor. The root of the disease. Its cave like a whirlpool. 
It's an illegitimate child with a new principle. 
What does blood mean to you?" 
<Page25>
It was a stern voice, not in keeping with the occasion. 
Arcueid's question could be taken as a reprimand. 
Vlov's eyes widened in surprise, then 
<Page26>
"Answering with respect. 
For me, blood is warmth itself. 
The heat of life. The elixir that heals my frostbite. That which turns my world, my principles. 
"That's right. Without blood, I'll freeze to death in this cold." 
In a voice that was even respectful, he revealed his identity. 
<Page27>
"I remember ....... 
One who hated, feared, and tried to avoid humans, drifted across an immense sea, and set up a castle. 
One of the twenty-seven ancestors, Zaria Offenbaum. 
I heard that she ruled the land without having any children, even though she had principles that lasted over a thousand years. ............ 
So you killed her and took it from her? 
<Page28>
"...... Yes. I'm not an heir. I'm just a knight. I was a knight. Eternity is too much for me." 
<Page29>
The vampire's right hand is pointed at his own shadow. 
From the long---unnaturally long shadows, a huge object emerged. 
<Page30>
"But it was even more unworthy of the head of the family. 
And so I took it. As a knight, I defeated the king and usurped his throne. Now, this principle has become my own personal curse. 
"Yes. It's been a short reign." 
<Page31>
"...... You're bullish, I’m not sure what to make of this. You are so weak that you can't even materialize your imagination, and yet you want to go toe to toe with me? 
"No need. There's no need to assimilate the world when you're dealing with mere mortals. 
As far as you are concerned... these claws are enough." 
"------" 
<Page32>
The edge of the vampire’s mouth lifted. 
The neat face turned into that of an ugly beast. 
He laughed at Arcueid's provocation, saying ‘that’s right’. 
<Page33>
"The strongest is the one that is constant and unbiased. 
...... You are just like that. I'm not sure if you've seen this before, but I'm sure you've seen it before. 
A primordial "one" that can deal with all kinds of curses, all kinds of situations... no ordinary mortal can match it." 
<Page34>
The air is distorted. 
The blue fever of ill thoughts lowered the temperature underground. 
<Page35>
Arcueid had no doubts. 
She knew that Vlov's strange weapon was something that could defeat her, but she still charged it head-on. 
And... 
<Page36>
"But you don't know that. 
Her territory is part of the planet but is excluded from the biosphere because it is ‘unfit to live in’. 
No matter how much of a True Ancestor princess you are, can you endure this hell? ......!" 
<Page37>
Cold air was spreading around Vlov. 
Arcueid came to a sudden stop and thrust out her hands as if to protect something. 
The wind blows, screeches, and covers the city in absolute zero. 
And. 
<Page38>
A huge spear of unworldly steel that shattered her pure white dress. 
<Page39>
...... a blizzard that hides one’s vision. 
The My exhaled breath rises, white. 
<Page40>
Arcueid was blown tens of meters away and collapsed on the rubble. 
The dress that had been repelling the flames now shattered. 
She's back to her old self. 
<Page41>
"...... monster. Are you still intact after being hit by my spear? 
But..." 
<Page42>
Arcueid lay collapsed and did not get up. 
Without moving an inch, Vlov held up his right hand as if to signal something. 
The rubble around Vlov crumbled. 
From underneath, several bodies crawled out, groaning. 
<Page43>
"This hunt is now mine. 
Go pick up the woman's body. 
Its adaptability. The all-powerful blood that surpasses all suffering, in my hands." 
<Page44>
At Vlov's command, the corpses walked up to Arcueid. 
<Page45>
The winner was decided. 
Our mission had failed. 
She couldn’t contain him with chains anymore. 
Arcueid had been defeated, and the city was engulfed in a cold wave. 
Everything was dying. 
I'm right in front of it, watching the final scene unfold below me...

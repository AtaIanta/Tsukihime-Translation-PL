The city was covered in a frenzied panic.
I ran through the crowded streets.
The fire in front of the station could be seen even from here.
<Page2>
The screens outside kept repeatedly broadcasting the breaking news.
A fire broke out around the vicinity of the north exit of Souya Station.
The trains were suspended, and the people who had been visiting the downtown area were frantically running for their lives.
<Page3>
An anchor was reporting the emergency news through the screens outdoors.
It was an interview with a high school girl who had just escaped from the fire.
"It's hot, it's hot. Hey, why is it so hot?"
"My friend, Yuka, just got eaten by them. They even got my arm. It's like... "
"They're moving even though they're dead! They're burning but they're laughing...!"
Her words were treated as delusions due to the extreme conditions.
<Page4>
The fire was spreading even now, to the point where nearby residents were called to evacuate.
Even with that, the main street was overflowing with people.
From the surrounding distance, people arrived through curiosity as they watched, photographed and forwarded the situation to their closest friends about the impending fire.
<Page5>
"...!"
The road to the station was already blocked off.
Fire prevention... no, it would be too early for such a response. More importantly, the number of personnel is way too high. 
It's as if they were guarding to keep the people inside from escaping out.
<Page6>
"Shit...!"
Either way, this is not the way to go forward.
"Shiki, over here."
She pulled my hand with force.
<Page7>
Without asking for my permission, Arcueid gripped my hand as she slipped through the crowd of people.
<Page8>
"H-hang on a second!
Why did you take me all the way here?"
<Page9>
I shake off my hand from hers.
As Arcueid looked up at the wall of the building, she said,
<Page10>
"Yeah. This should be enough.
This is my first time flying with another person, but it shouldn't be an issue at this height."
"Huh?"
<Page11>
There was no hesitation in her movements.
Arcueid grasped my arm as if she was pinning me down, and then...
<Page12>
"We're going to fly. Hold on tight, Shiki."
She just said something completely outrageous---!
<Page13>
"Wah"
<Page14>
"Waah"
<Page15>
"WAAAAAAAAAAAHHH-----!?"
<Page16>
We're flying.
No, we're jumping.
<Page17>
Arcueid jumped towards the building wall, bouncing off it after a bit and repeating the motion again the opposite direction. Before I knew it, we were above the building, no, soaring across the sky.
Of course, she did all of this while grabbing me by her side.
<Page18>
"W-w-wait a, waaaaaah...!"
It's so high! I'm terrified! How many meters above ground is this? That building must have been around 40 meters and we're above that!? Even a 20 meter drop-tower ride would make my heart shrink, let alone this! Not to mention the complete lack of safety gear!
<Page19>
"? Shiki, you'll bite your tongue off if you open your mouth like that."
<Page20>
As I tilt my head to cover my screaming, Arcueid ramps up the brutal pace even further.
We hopped off each rooftop from building to building. Just like a rabbit jumping on the moon.
<Page21>
"Uoh, Uooh, Uoooooooooh---!?"
My face tightens at the unprecedented experience.
Just as I was starting to enjoy this, at long last, Arcueid finally stopped her leaping.
<Page22>
It was a rooftop of a skyscraper overlooking the city.
We had landed on an aerial garden that was not originally designed for humans to enter.
<Page23>
"Eh---you, w-what the hell was that about---"
<Page24>
The onslaught of up and down movements disrupted my breathing.
My chest is in pain. The disordered blood circulation created a strain on my heart.
Although there was no change in the air pressure, my entire body became rigid from the sudden experience that I never had before.
<Page25>
"Look. Over there."
"What do you mean, look ther---"
<Page26>
I stopped just before I could finish my sentence.
At that moment, I forgot all about the pain of my elevated heart rate.
<Page27>
---It's burning.
The city I live in, the familiar buildings, are all being consumed by the sea of flames.
"What------"
My eyes started to reveal the full extent of the tragedy in detail.
<Page28>
The main street was wrapped in a red veil.
Little by little, the flames burned away the outline of the buildings as if it was being cut by a blade.
<Page29>
It was a sea of fire. Within it was a man consuming repeatedly. He bathed himself in a rain of crimson blood as if to show his appetite being satisfied.
There were several people in front of the man.
They were police officers that were setting up a surround.
The officers raised their pistols and fired in unison.
<Page30>
"---Wha---"
However, the man did not budge.
Even though they were cops, the man did not care enough to notice them.
More figures appeared from behind Vlov.
<Page31>
Burning Corpses.
Perhaps they were people who were alive just a few minutes ago, but now they have become moving corpses.
As if they were begging for help,
the corpses moved towards the firing officers---
<Page32>
"---What the hell, is this---"
I felt a white flame burning in my throat.
I didn't even have the chance to look away.
The sense of duty and urgency I had while running towards the city was wiped clean.
Right now, the only thing left in my mind was pure awe.
<Page33>
That was a vampire's true nature.
A thing that simply killed people just by existing.
And now it is an enemy that we must defeat no matter what---
<Page34>
"... There's no sign of them. Those guys from the church.
If they really were so adamant about hunting vampires, they would have been here by now... I guess they're not in this country after all.
But that doesn't explain the unusually strict control of traffic... Perhaps the Executors are in plain uniform instead of their usual battle gear."
<Page35>
Arcueid was not looking at the sea of fire.
Instead, she was focusing her attention on something completely different.
<Page36>
"So what's the plan, Shiki?
As you can see, this is Vlov's true nature. He's a mass murderer that had no intention of finding me in the first place."
<Page37>
"If we leave him be, he'll eventually run out of blood and become weak.
The scale of Vlov's attack means that this city will probably burn to the ground, but after that, I can defeat him alone.
Will you be watching from the sidelines? Or---"
<Page38>
She asks whether I'm willing to risk my life to save others.
Although she already knows what I'm about to say, Arcueid confirms for the final time.
And so with all the determination I could muster, I glared at her as my body shuddered.
<Page39>
"...Sigh. It seems that I can't make you change your mind.
To think that you would still fight after seeing that. Perhaps I was wrong about the both of you.
But what are you going to do?
I don't mind if I begin right now in this condition."
<Page40>
Begin right now...?
You're going to move the battlefield... no, you mean you're going to change the area!?
<Page41>
"Is there anything you can do about this situation!?"
"Yes, if all things go well. I don't want to attract any attention either."
"I'm begging you...! Please go in and fight him right now...!"
<Page42>
"Understood. Then I'll drop all of them underground.
There seems to be some kind of hollow space underneath."
<Page43>
...Wait. She's going to drop them... underground?
No, this is no time to be asking questions.
Right now, we need to get them off the streets as fast as possible...!
<Page44>
"But don't forget our promise. Make sure you find me afterwards."
<Page45>
I was so amazed that I couldn't keep up with my thoughts at all.
That's outrageous---
Leaving me behind, Arcueid leapt from the rooftop and into the void.
<Page46>
It was like a white flower dancing in the wind.
<Page47>
A swirl of air catches the body as it is thrown from the rooftop.
The chains of gravity were broken,
the anchors of attraction were hoisted,
and the thing that should have fallen, rose gently instead.
Like a sailing ship catching the wind, she frolics around in the night sky.
<Page48>
There was nothing to be surprised about.
That incarnation was a projection of a child from another planet.
All the fluctuations that occur on the surface belonged to her.
<Page49>
The blessings of nature that give way to life,
the wrath of nature that takes away life,
all of which were naturally endowed rights of that body.
<Page50>
"Okay---"
The beautiful flower turned itself to look at the moon.
Her consciousness was turned from the sky to the ground.
The unravelled chains and the hoisted anchors struck the surface of the Earth.
Below her was a tall, stone building scattering fire.
"---Let's do this!"
<Page51>
The blooming flower in the night sky turned into a falling star.
The flower of the moon transformed itself into a tempest, blowing away the burning blaze.

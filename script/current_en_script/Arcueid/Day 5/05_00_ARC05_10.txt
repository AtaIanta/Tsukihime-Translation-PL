"I'm grabbed.
I roll over onto my back.
My heart and lungs screamed with joy.
My breathing, which had been stopped for so long, finally resumed to a human level.
<Page2>
My hands no longer move.
I'm not even sure if I'm holding the knife.
The only thing I can be sure of is the pain all over my body, and the consciousness that seems to fall into darkness as soon as I relax.
<Page3>
...... I'm so lucky. It's a blessing that my sense of pain has been numbed.
The pain in my left foot that I stepped into while gliding is more than I can bear in normal times. It's as if every bone is being sawed away. I can't even feel the pain that sparks come out of my eyes right now.
<Page4>
"But... damn.
I didn't want to, but I couldn't help swearing.
<Page5>
...... There's nothing like the aftermath of survival.
There is no pride in having accomplished a feat.
This is not a miracle or anything. I just slammed my emotions down after everything was over.
<Page6>
"----- moon"
There moon is missing in the night sky.
I wonder if it's .......
I miss it terribly. I think I saw something similar to this in my dream at least once.
<Page7>
"Are you okay, Shiki?"
<Page8>
Arcueid walked up to me as if nothing had happened.
<Page9>
"............... Well, I'm alive.
The truth is, I feel like I'm dying, and it's hard to speak up.
 But I'm still alive, and I can't allow myself to be so weak.
<Page10>
"Oh, you're so humble.
Even though you are a newcomer, you killed one of the founders, right?
You should be more proud of yourself.
<Page11>
Arcueid looks as happy as she can be.
...... In fact, killing Vlov must have been worth it. I'm sure you'll be able to understand that.
But still...
<Page12>
...... There was nothing I could do.
How far did that glacier invade the city? At the very least, the carnage was even worse than at the hotel, and I had to overlook it again.
"What?I'm not dead.
If it's Vrove's curse, I've prevented it all from happening.
---Haven't I?
<Page13>
 "What do you mean by that?
 As soon as I strained to sit up, I felt a sharp pain in my left leg that sent me sprawling.
<Page14>
Come on, come on, come on. You need to lie down.
"Geez, ......!would you please explain it to me.
Are you sure I'm not dead, ......?"
<Page15>
 "Yes. When the principle of the Vlov went out of control, I coated what I could with a convection membrane.
If you hadn't killed Vlov in those instants, I wouldn't have been able to follow through the attack."
<Page16>
An outrageous offense, Arcueid readily confessed.
...... Speaking of which, that time.
 You made a strange, sudden stop before being hit by Vlov's spear.
That was not to protect herself, but to protect the city. ......?
<Page17>
...... No, it was. If you think about it, it's weird that I'm still alive after that cold wave spread.
Just as I was able to breathe in those super cold temperatures, the people of the city must have been safe.
So...
<Page18>
That's why she's in such a mess.
When I was thinking only of myself, she protected the entire city, knowing that she would be outnumbered...
<Page19>
"Why would you do that?
You said you didn't care about humans!
In a fit of unidentified rage, I shouted at the brainiac in front of me.
Arcueid raised and lowered her eyebrows curiously.
<Page20>
"Because you asked me to do so.
She said something as stupid as that
<Page21>
"------"
...... Did I say that?
When?Where?Maybe it was...
<Page22>
"I don't know, you're different. You've never sucked blood, have you?
So be it. I don't care if you're a vampire or not, as long as you stay out of our way.
<Page23>
---I can't believe it.
"Don't touch humans.
And you followed that?
One wrong move and it would have destroyed itself.
<Page24>
"This is ......."
I laughed at the fact.
I am now more dumbfounded than ever.
I'm more stunned than ever, but I'm also more grateful than ever.
<Page25>
I close my ......eyelids.
I think I can go to sleep now.
My chest, which was filled with nothing but regret earlier, is now filled with relief.
My consciousness fades away.
I forget the pain in my legs and fall into a deep sleep.
and .......
<Page26>
I was snapped back to consciousness by Arcueid.
"...... What do you think you're doing?
<Page27>
"No. If you fall asleep with such a wound, it will be more painful when you wake up. This is more efficient."
<Page28>
---That's a perfectly valid argument.
Who was it that said the same thing to this person?
<Page29>
"...... Arcueid. Can I give you some advise"
"Hmm, what?"
"You know what? Don't be so reckless, you stupid girl.
<Page30>
That was the limit.
That was it, I had used up all my energy.
<Page31>
My consciousness fades.
Arueid is screaming about something, but I don't have the strength to open my eyes anymore.
<Page32>
"Oh ...... hey Shiki, are you really going to fall asleep ......?"
...... That's why I'm sleepy.
I'll sleep before I die, and I'll wake up in the morning.
<Page33>
"Really, really?That's going to hurt, isn't it?Don't you have to heal it?I'm sure you'll faint when you wake up."
---Oh, shut up.
I'm going to sleep, so if you want to do something, do it.
<Page34>
"Yeah, you should've told me that earlier.
After hearing a cheerful voice.
I felt the cold fingertips, colder than my current body, touch my skin in a caring way.
It was a pleasant feeling, and I felt more joy than sleepiness.
<Page35>
"Spoils of war?Or rather, the carcass of my ancestor?
Well, whatever!I was just wondering where I should throw it away!
...... Nuchari?
<Page36>
What, what, what did I just feel? Did you just apply something?
Ooh, there it is, there it is, the pain is coming back!
It hurts so much, it itches, it's scary!
What the hell are you..."
<Page37>
I was about to say, "What the hell did you do?" when I was hit with a tremendous feeling of emptiness.
<Page38>
Was that shouting the last bit of heat left in my body?
This time, my consciousness fell into an irresistible sleep.
<Page39>
"It's okay, it's not that bad. If it's just the burned flesh, this will cover it up.
But I'm not so sure about the bones. You should see a human doctor later.
The cold fingertips move away.
<Page40>
"You fell asleep, Shiki?
---Oh, I'm really am asleep.
It's been a long time since I've had such a deep and not so terrifying sleep.
<Page41>
"I can't help it. your house is at the top of the hill, right?
I'll manage to get you home somehow.
 I fall asleep, gazing at the white moon
<Page42>
"...... Good night, Shiki. And thank you.
You saved my life tonight."
<Page43>
 Words of gratitude that don't seem to carry any weight at all.
I can't hear her voice any more.
This time, without being disturbed by anyone, Tohno Shiki's consciousness fell into a deep sleep.

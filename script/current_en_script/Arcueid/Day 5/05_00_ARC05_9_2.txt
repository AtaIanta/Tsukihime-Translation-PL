Sliding.
No, it's more like falling.
......, but can I do it?It's up to luck to get there.
<Page2>
You're definitely not going to make it. Even if everything goes well, the impact of the landing will tear my muscles and break the bones.
Can I endure that pain?
<Page3>
I stop the bullet just in time, as if it were to strike my hesitation.
Watch out. Thank goodness.
Thanks. I'm ready now.
Just bear the load. I'm not naturally sensitive to the pain of death.
Like him, I'll consider killing without a second's hesitation.
<Page4>
I turn and run to Arcueid in the rear.
With that extra movement, my strength was completely spent.
I can't take even one more step forward.
The enemy is 50 meters away.
<Page5>
I don't care.
 <Horizontal|・><Axis|・><Horizontal|・><Distance|・><Rear|> doesn't matter for this choice anyway.
<Page6>
"Arcueid, can you do that again?"
"Do what?"
<Page7>
Tell Arcueid what you want.
The explanation ended with a single word.
After a beat of confusion, Arcueid looked at me and agreed, as if she had no choice.
<Page8>
"...... If we do this on that scale, I won't have much energy left.
And you're okay with that?You can't run away now, can you?"
<Page9>
I nodded
I don't have the strength to speak up. I mean, is this person still looking for an opportunity to do that?
<Page10>
"huh, but doesn't that mean you'll fall in the middle?
I can't control that, can I?"
"Of course I'm going to fall!So..."
<Page11>
I want to breathe a little better, but I shout and explain.
There..,
<Page12>
"---!"
There's no time to explain.
A spear of ice shoots out. Vlov is relentless, and he's going to pierce Arcueid through me.
<Page13>
"Just give it everything you've got, and don't cut corners!I don't care if you overdo it!If you kill me, so be it!"
<Page14>
There's no time for pretense.
I took my gaze off Arcueid and stared at the enemy in the distance.
The woman behind me is responding to my order,
<Page15>
"Yes, leave it to me!I'll let you win, Shiki!"

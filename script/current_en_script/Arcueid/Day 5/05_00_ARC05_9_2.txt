Sliding..
No, it's more like falling.
......, but can I do it? It's up to luck to get there.
<Page2>
I'm definitely not going to make it. Even if i'm lucky, the impact of the landing will tear my muscles and break the bones.
Can I endure that pain?
<Page3>
I stop the bullet just in time, as if it were to strike my hesitation.
Watch out. Thank goodness.
I think I'm ready now.
I just have to bear the load. I'm not naturally sensitive to the pain of death.
Like him, I'll consider killing without a second's hesitation.
<Page4>
I turn around and run towards Arcueid in the rear.
With that extra movement, my stamina was completely exhausted.
I can't even take a single step forward.
The enemy is 50 meters away.
<Page5>
I don't care.
 <Horizontal|・><Axis|・><Horizontal|・><Distance|・><Rear|> doesn't matter for this choice anyway.
<Page6>
"Arcueid, can you do that again?"
"Do what?"
<Page7>
I inform Arcueid of what I want.
The explanation ended with a single word.
After a moment of confusion, Arcueid looked at me and agreed, as if she had no choice.
<Page8>
"...... If we do this on that scale, I won't have much energy left.
Are you sure that's okay? You won't be able to run away anymore, will you?"
<Page9>
I nodded.
I don't have the strength to speak up. I mean, is this person still looking for an opportunity to do that?
<Page10>
"huh, but doesn't that mean you'll fall in the middle?
I can't control that, can I?"
"Of course I'm going to fall! So..."
<Page11>
I wanted to breathe a little better, but instead I shouted to explain.
There..,
<Page12>
"---!"
There's no time to explain.
A spear of ice shoots out. Vlov is relentless, and he's going to pierce Arcueid right through me.
<Page13>
"Just give it everything you've got, and don't cut corners! I don't care if you overdo it! If you want to kill me, so be it!"
<Page14>
There's no time for pretense.
I take my gaze off Arcueid and stare at vlov in the distance.
The woman behind me is responding to my command,
<Page15>
"Yes, leave it to me! I'll let you win, Shiki!"

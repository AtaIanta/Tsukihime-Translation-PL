　But I've never done anything like this before, either.
　I said first aid, but all I could think of was antiseptic, gauze to seal the wound, bandages, and painkillers.
　And then there's nutrition. They need to be nourished anyway.
<Page2>
　Fortunately, we have plenty of money.
　Amateurish idea or not, it's better to have something than nothing. You never know what might help that guy.
　Believing that, I bought everything I could think of.
<Page3>
 "Hey, that tickles!"
 "..............."
<Page4>
　Ignoring the nervousness in her voice, she applied the gauze as delicately as she could.
　The wound in Alcade's abdomen wasn't that big.
<Page5>
　...... No, a four-centimeter-deep laceration running horizontally would be fatal if it were human, but, according to Arcueid.
 "It's not a big deal at all!"
　That's right.
<Page6>
　Apparently, internal organs heal on their own eventually. It's so out of the ordinary that I don't want to talk about it.
　The bleeding had stopped and all that was left to do was to close the wound, but from that point on, things didn't go as planned.
<Page7>
　It might be counterproductive for a wound this big, but I'll apply some antiseptic to it in case it gets infected by bacteria.
　I thought he would go wild because it was sinking in, but Arcueid didn't move at all. Rather.
 "Hmm?　Did you just do something?
　This is a dull ...... no, it is a sturdy.
<Page8>
 "...... Good."
　Gauze is applied to the wound and a bandage is carefully wrapped around it.
 "Hahaha, stop it, Shiki is too good!"
<Page9>
　What fun, Arcueid laughs merrily.
　The disinfectant didn't scare her, but the bandage tickled her.
<Page10>
 "............"
　Ignore him and pin the bandage on. The wound is said to stop bleeding if you bind it a little tighter, so I gave it a final squeeze.
 "I'm not sure what to say. That was a point deduction, Shiki.
<Page11>
 "..............."
　Phew. Well, that's all I can do for now.
　Incidentally, I closed the curtains again out of concern for Arcueid.
<Page12>
 "...... Well. I've only tried to look good, but I don't know.
　Can you move, Arcueid?"
<Page13>
 "Yes, it looks fine to move. The inside is still messed up, though, so it won't be able to move satisfactorily."
<Page14>
 "Yeah. Well, you'll have to deal with that on your end.
　I specialize in cutting, healing is outside my jurisdiction."
　I move away from Arcueid and sit down by the wall.
<Page15>
 "'Good night, you can go to sleep now.
　As soon as I sleep and get my strength back, I'll be fine, right?　I'll keep an eye on you, and you'll sleep quietly."
<Page16>
 "No, sleeping won't heal your wounds. I'm sure you're not the only one.
　In my case, my strength recovers purely with the passage of time. At night, I can recover enough to move normally for the time being."
<Page17>
　It's not good for your mental health to see Arcueid in pain, even if you say so.。
<Page18>
 "Just go to sleep.
　You look like you're in pain just talking to me right now."
 "But since Shiki is awake...
　I didn't want to go to sleep."
<Page19>
 Arcueid sits up in bed.
　I'm in full-on chatter mode.
 "Fuck."
　I don't have a choice.
　I've got some questions I need to ask you too, so let's hang out with Arcueid some more.
<Page20>
 "Arcueid. Can I ask you about the hotel yesterday?"
 "...... That's right. I'm sure you'll find a lot of people who'd like to know more about this.
<Page21>
 "That guy yesterday ...... said something about Vlov, but what the hell is that guy?
　I know you're a vampire. I'm not sure what to make of it. But..."
<Page22>
　That blue flame. What is that fire that fills the hallway and burns only humans? That is too far removed from the image of a vampire.
<Page23>
 "Mmm. What do you mean, you're more like me?
　...... But are you sure Shiki is right?
　That guy, his body wasn't falling apart, and his principles were small scale. He's probably the orthodox vampire that humans envision.
　---except for that river of fire.
<Page24>
 "That's it. ...... After all, is that fire abnormal from your point of view?　Is he stronger than you?"
　...... and. The Arcueid guy sighed outrageously bluntly.
<Page25>
 "That's right. I've been killed by someone else, and I'm down to the level of fighting with those second-rate mortals.
　If you were to compare 　me now with Vlov, that one is slightly higher.
<Page26>
 "...... So, yeah.
　If it's a normal Arcueid, is it someone you can manage to beat?"
<Page27>
 "It's not usually a fight!
　Who do you think is the reason I'm enduring this humiliation?　If it were true, I could have flattened that new apprentice with just a glare!"
<Page28>
 Oh, I'm so pissed off. ......
　But right now, I don't want to know about all that bullshit.
　As a practical matter, I'd like to know if Arcueid can defeat that vampire .......
<Page29>
 "I can't. Vlov is better than me now.
 We're simply outperforming them, and if we fight them without a plan, they'll kill us."
 "You're quite decisive, aren't you? You were so angry earlier.
<Page30>
 "It's just a fact. I'm not going to prejudge or hope for the best, because it's obvious."
<Page31>
　I was a little pressured when he ...... told me.
　When it comes to fighting, Arcueid has a thoroughly serious thought process.
　When I see his cold-heartedness, I realize again, after all this time, that he is also a vampire.

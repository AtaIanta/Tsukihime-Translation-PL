　The location of the enemy is clear.
　I have to defeat vlov down there.
　And Arcueid, who I promised to fight with.
<Page2>
　The battle between the two has already begun.
　...... Don't worry. My role is not to fight, but to finish the job.
　When Arcueid captures Vlov, I will approach him and cut his lines of death.
　For that...
<Page3>
"Yes, this is no time to be scared. ......!
　I slid down the slope of rubble and landed on the sunken ground.
　I immediately covered my mouth and nose with one hand.
　It was not intentional, but a reflexive action to protect life.
<Page4>
"---"
　I can't breathe.
　I have oxygen. This blue flame is a curse, not an actual burning of matter, as the hotel fight had shown.
<Page5>
　But it's still hot, Just breathing normally will cause your lungs to burn to death from the hot air.
<Page6>
　A vampire in white and a vampire in black can be seen ahead.
　Their swords and claws intersect.
　In this high temperature, Arcueid is attacking Vlov without fear.
<Page7>
　As far as I can see, Arcueid has the upper hand.
　If things continue as they are, she'll capture Vlov as planned.
　The problem is...
<Page8>
"---, ------"
　The question is, how long will my body last?
　My body #is already #starting to catch on fire.
<Page9>
　But strangely, I don't feel any pain.
　I don't need to breathe to know what's going on.
　I keep my knife in my hand, waiting for the moment to take down Vlov.
　Like a sprinter waiting for the start signal.
　Or like a ghost that will never move again.
<Page10>
　Keep waiting.
　Keep waiting.
　Keep waiting.
　Even when my eyeballs dry up, get smoked, and turn to ashes, I keep waiting.
　The moment will never come.
　As if I will never realize that I am nothing but a burned film.

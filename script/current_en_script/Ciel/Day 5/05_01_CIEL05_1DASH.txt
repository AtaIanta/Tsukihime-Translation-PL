"We'll wait until your strength is restored."
Relieved by this plan, Arcueid soon fell asleep.
<Page2>
I saw it through and walked out of the apartment.
I don't have to think about where I should be going...
It is a department store in front of the station where Vlov's stronghold is said to be.
<Page3>
The area in front of the station was no different than usual.
A glamorous department store street with advertisements and products on display. People pass by, looking across the windows.
In one of these streams, there is a large department store that I am familiar with.
<Page4>
It is one of the biggest department stores in the city.
Many people still come in and out of this department store, which can be called the face of Soya Station, but is it really ......?
<Page5>
" ...... It's a prime spot in front of the station, here.
There's not a vampire in sight. ......"
<Page6>
I don't think Arcueid was lying.
She' s got no common sense, but her judgment and information are accurate.
Perhaps it is because she is not bound by common sense that she arrived at this impossible reality.
<Page7>
"By the way, ...... Arihiko also said there's a lot of crazy stuff going on at the north entrance. ......
<Page8>
"There is a part-time job that anyone can do and it pays well."
It's an urban legend with no credibility, a childish lure.
The reason it has lived on the Internet for so long without being discontinued, and yet spreading flamboyantly, is because it is not a lie at all.
<Page9>
There is no one who can testify to the details of this part-time job. It is also unclear whether anyone has actually experienced it.
Nevertheless, rumors about this part-time job continue to circulate.
The number of people receiving these messages is unspecified, but the messages continue to be sent out.
<Page10>
...... In other words. This means that regardless of the authenticity of the content, there is someone out there who is in need of a third party.
<Page11>
As it turned out, there was nothing unusual about the department store.
From the grocery store in the basement to the specialty stores on the seventh floor, it was an ordinary department store.
It was just....
<Page12>
"There's no way to get up from the seventh floor....... Considering the size of this department store, it should have at least ten floors. ......"
<Page13>
The elevator only had a button to go up to the seventh floor, and the stairs had a sign saying that the entire seventh floor was off-limits.
<Page14>
Aiming for a time when no one was around, I climbed up the stairs through the no-entry rope.
The stairs led up to the upper floor, but it was a dead end.
The part leading to the eighth floor had shutters down as expected.
Next to it, there was a locked emergency door.
<Page15>
"...... If there's anything there, it's either across this way or at ......."
I pondered whether to go inside or to return back.
<Page16>
I know I'm going to do something reckless.
I'm going into a monster's den alone.
I've already tasted how crazy it is.
I've tasted it many times before.
<Page17>
"...... okay. I can still get there."
I clutched the knife in my pocket.
I've got this eye if it comes down to it.
<Page18>
I thought about running to the police and explaining the situation. It was the safest thing to do.
But what would that do?In the first place, I'm going to kill him. How can I convince the police that I'm about to kill someone? There's no way we can share the same goal.
<Page19>
"...... I' ll check on him first.
If things get out of hand, I can go back to Arcueid ......"
<Page20>
I take off my glasses and "kill" the lock on the locked emergency door.
I let a hard spit run down my numb throat.
I took a deep breath to calm myself down and slipped to the floor where the lights had gone out.
<Page21>
Inside the eighth floor, it was all dark.
It was only natural that the lights were off, but it was still too unexpected.
It was daytime. Even if there is no electricity, the sunlight from the windows should be bright.
<Page22>
However, the reality is this. The windows are blocked from the inside with something that looks like an iron plate.
This is too much for anti-theft measures.
The iron plates are attached with bolts and cannot be removed by human power. The plates are even attached to the small window of the bathroom.
<Page23>
Pathological obsession. The work is messy.
The size of the steel plate doesn't quite match the size of the window, so the sunlight is coming in through a small gap.
<Page24>
I can only think of it as a creation that does not prevent people from escaping from within, rather than preventing people from entering from outside.
<Page25>
Or --- am I overthinking it and this is just a sunshade?
If so, ......
<Page26>
"Isn't ...... too clean, this place ......?"
Even though there was dust everywhere in the hallway, there was no strange smell and no strange objects to be found.
<Page27>
This is just a floor under renovation.
There's not a shadow of the disaster here that was in the hotel.
<Page28>
"The ninth floor is clean, too. ...... I wonder if Arcueid misunderstood something. ......
<Page29>
My tense nerves loosen slightly.
I go up to the tenth floor without realizing that the slight loosening is fatal.
And then, at that moment
<Page30>
"Oh?Who the hell are you, and why are you in my house without permission?"
<Page31>
I braced myself at the sudden sound of someone's voice.
At the top of the stairs, a pair of people with flashlights were standing at the entrance.
<Page32>
".................."
I observe them, squinting into the light.
They were both male, not much older than me.
They had only flashlights in their hands. They had no long-handled tools like bats or pipes.
<Page33>
"Hey, why aren't you talking?Are you aware that you're doing something wrong?What's with this guy, isn't he lame?He' s so scared, isn't he?He' s too different from us, isn't he?Hey Toshi, do you know this guy with glasses?
<Page34>
"I don't know, If I had known such a nerd, I would have died of embarrassment.
Hey, Bokuu, come over here, okay?If you run away, you'll get hurt badly, okay?Or should I kill him? Technically, I can kill you for trespassing, right?"
<Page35>
The pair laughed and refused to move from their place ...... in front of the elevator.
"Don't run away," they said, not even considering the fact that I'd run straight to the stairs.
<Page36>
"What's with the lack of response?Aren't you going to run away?It's normal to run away in this situation. Toshi, isn't there something fishy about this guy?
「テメエの顔がクドすぎんだよ。メガネくんには刺激が強すぎるってもんだ。……なあ、そうだよな？面食らってるダケだよな？なんで立ち入り禁止のフロアで遊んでるワケ？」
"..............."
In the darkness, I thought I saw a dull glint in the eyes of the pair.
<Page37>
".................."
What do I do?
Should I run away or try to talk to them?
Is this really the home of vampires in the first place?
Can I check that with these two guys?
<Page38>
"What is this, a bonus time?
Hey Toshi, I thought you said that you could do whatever you want with people who don't have appointments!
<Page39>
"Shut up, Hal. Shut up for one minute.
So, how about it, nerd? Are you just a nerd?
"..............."
<Page40>
I'll take the information and sort out the situation.
I'll keep an eye on the duo's movements.
<Page41>
"I'm sorry. I heard that you can get a part-time job here. ......"
In a voice that sounded unsure of itself, I looked at the man called Toshi.
<Page42>
"...... part-time job. Where did you hear about it?I've only been talking about it to a bunch of stupid girls lately."
"I heard about it through a friend that you can get a lot of money if you spend the night in an apartment at the north entrance."

...... No matter how much she looks at me like that, I can't nod.
There was no way I could deal with the insanity of a woman who could come back to life after being torn apart, or a black panther, or a burning corpse.
<Page2>
"...... Sorry, but I can't help you. I'm just a student. I don't know what you're expecting, but if you're looking for a partner, look elsewhere."
"Hmm. A mere student who cuts up random girls into pieces?"
<Page3>
I'm weak when you put it that way. On a scale of normal to abnormal, my eyes are in the same category as this person's.
......, but even that didn't put me off this far.
I could have lived a normal life and never gone off the rails.
If I hadn't met this phony woman.
<Page4>
"No, you're wrong. I was a decent guy until I met you. I didn't want to kill anyone, and I was doing just fine.
...... Yes. That was the only time I was different. I'm a scumbag, yes, but I'd have been normal if I hadn't met you."
<Page5>
"Oh my God, shut up!"
<Page6>
"-----?"
The red pupils of her eyes open.
The girl's mood changes completely.
What a terrible chill.
I thought my heart was going to stop just because she was staring at me.
<Page7>
"Don't misunderstand me. You did kill me.
I would have pulled your head off right here, but I'm only letting you help me because I think you can be of use."
<Page8>
"-------oh."
No exaggeration.
Just a stare and the world was transformed into a silent wilderness.
<Page9>
My throat, which was hot, and my fingers, which were trembling, froze in an instant.
The <chill|fear> that runs down my spine takes over.
My instincts as a living creature are screaming at me.
<Page10>
What did I really misunderstand?
The thing I am looking at is just a killing machine in the shape of a person.
<Page11>
I can't breathe.
No, breathing is not permitted without an extra movement.
Breathe in. Turn my eyes. Move my fingers. It doesn't matter. Whatever it is, if I move even slightly, the next thing I know, my body will be being crushed by something enormous.
It is not an illusion, but an inevitable future that my instincts have sensed.
<Page12>
"-----------,-----------"
Limbs thrashing about, trying to escape now.
                     ------I don't want to die.
The thought process to do the best I can to put it together.
                     ------I don't want to die.
<Page13>
I'm gonna die soon. If I run, I die.
If I stay here, I die. If I move, I die.
But sooner or later, fear will kill my reason.
But if I make a sound, my life will end.
                     ------That's it. She'll kill me no matter what.
<Page14>
My spirit is being burned by that conclusion.
I am trapped in a conflicted escape.
<Page15>
My spirit was being cut out and folded endlessly.
It seemed to go on forever, but suddenly it was over.
<Page16>
"aa.......AAAH..."
I fall to the ground on my knees.
I hug my own body, releasing the pressure.
<Page17>
...... Thank goodness. I'm still alive.
<Page18>
"What do you think? I hope you understand your position a little better now."
<Page19>
......I understand.
I can only look up at this monster, struggling to keep my teeth from shaking and chattering.
<Page20>
"I'm not talking about what you can or can't do. If you do as I say, I'll let you live. If you don't, I'll kill you.
See, it's easy, isn't it? I'm simply asking you if you want to live or die."
<Page21>
"--------"
I couldn't speak properly.
But instinctively, I nodded my head.
<Page22>
"Good. The deal is done."
The woman reaches out her hand to me as I kneel down.
<Page23>
"I'm Arcueid......well, that's a long name, so just Arcueid.
I'm a vampire classified as a True Ancestor, what's your name?"
<Page24>
She introduced herself, which I had never seen her do before and sighed heavily.
It's......a sigh of resignation, or perhaps a sign that I' ve accepted this nonsense situation.
<Page25>
"Tohno Shiki. Unfortunately, I'm just a student......I'll tell you up front, I'm really of no use to you."
<Page26>
I hold the hand of the gir---Arcueid and stand up. 
She looked at me seriously, and then,
Asked me to shake her hand again.
<Page27>
"Nice to meet you then, Shiki.
I want you to take full responsibility for killing me."
<Page28>
Arcueid smiles and holds out her left hand.
...... I'm sure there are many responsibilities in the world, but I'm probably the first and last person to take responsibility for helping the person I killed.
<Page29>
"...... Yeah, it's really crazy."
But there's nothing else I can do about this.
I reluctantly held out my left hand and shook hands with the white girl who called herself a vampire.

......Let's eat in the classroom.
However, I don't have much of an appetite today.
If I eat like this, I feel like I'll end up vomiting, so I think I'll be better off resting in the classroom.......
<Page2>
Hey Tohno, c'mon let's get some food.
"---"
What little appetite I have disappears when I see his expression.
Okay, I'll skip lunch. Thanks for the motivation, Arihiko.
<Page3>
"Sorry, I think I'll pass today. You can go on your own."
"What the hell, you're getting more unhealthy by the day!
What, is your new life as a aristocrat not suiting you?"
<Page4>
"You know, I' m not an aristocrat. ...... Well, maybe you're right. If I' m not considered an aristocrat, then who is?
The bathrooms in the mansion are huge, Arihiko. They're bigger than your room. And more expensive too."
"Seriously!?　I'm not sure I'd want to live like that."
<Page5>
......I take back my earlier comment.
Thanks, Arihiko. I'm happy for your feedback.
It's soothing to hear something I can agree with wholeheartedly.
<Page6>
"......Well, I can't only complain about the mansion.
Even if I get up at seven in the morning, they complain that I'm late, and the curfew is at 8. On top of that, if I stay out overnight without permission, I'll get interrogated. It's like living in a prison, right?
<Page7>
"Oh? Isn't that a good thing?
Long live the regime, young people need to live more rigid lives. You can't be a good adult if you have fun while you're young."
"I agree, but you make it sound more convincing."
After all, you're the ultimate role model.
<Page8>
"Really? You're being awfully friendly today, Tohno.
Alright then, I'll give you a piece of sweet bread!"
"I'm fine. Don't worry about me, just eat. Lunchtime's almost over.
<Page9>
"Really?
Well then, more for me."
Arihiko clasps his hands together and began to eat his bread.
Looking at him, he seems like a man who really appreciates his meals.
<Page10>
"Pardon me."
.......And
 Senpai comes in with what looks like a lunch bag in her hand.
<Page11>
"Senpai? I thought you ate in the cafeteria?"
"No, I don't have a specific place that I eat at. I just eat wherever I feel like."
<Page12>
Senpai takes her lunch out of the cute drawstring bag.
It's a bit large for a girl.
<Page13>
"So, you woke up early today and made your own lunch, right?"
<Page14>
"Yes, I woke up a little before seven this morning, which is unusual for me......
Hey, what are you trying to say, Tohno-kun?"
<Page15>
"No, I wasn't trying to...... Senpai, are you not a morning person?"
"No, I'm not. Actually, I'm bad at waking up early.
When I'm volunteering, I tend to be pretty reckless with my time and energy."
<Page16>
"My parents owned a bakery, so I used to wake up early every day. Unfortunately, I was always really tired in the morning. Growing up, I was always angry at my father."
<Page17>
What a bakery!
Arihiko and I look at each other. I bet he' s imagining Ciel kneading and baking flour with white fingers in the kitchen.
<Page18>
"I fought with my father for three years, but in the end he said,
'I'd rather work a second job than train you!'
Then threw me out of the kitchen.
Since then, I've been quite flexible when it comes to when I wake up.
<Page19>
Ciel-senpai looks proud of herself.
"Is that so? That's kind of surprising.
You seem like a very capable person."
<Page20>
"Yes, I try my best not to screw up in front of you. To be honest, I'm actually rather clumsy."
<Page21>
......Well, that's not a bad point.
It's the same thing with volunteer work.
People with amazing abilities don't do things that don't benefit them.
<Page22>
"I see. ---But I like people who are clumsy.
I feel safe when I'm with them."
Arihiko agrees.
"So, you normally go the school cafeteria?"
<Page23>
"Yes, I eat at the school cafeteria most of the time, but sometimes I make my own lunch like this. Usually it's just a bunch of pre-prepared dishes.
You two prefer eating at the school cafeteria, don't you?"
<Page24>
"No, it depends on the mood we're in as well. When I was a freshman, I used to have my sister make lunch, but Tohno always ate bread or school food, so I would just eat wherever he was at."
<Page25>
"Huh, Tohno-kun is a moody guy, isn't he?"
"Yeah, you'll only get worn out if you go out with guys like him, so watch out, Senpai.
<Page26>
Senpai agrees with Arihiko, and opens the lid of her lunch box.
In the round bento box, there are half rice and half side dishes. It is a very orthodox lunch box, but there seems to be a large amount of food.
<Page27>
"Then let's eat.
Can I borrow your neighbor's chair?"
"The chair of a person who's not here is everyone's chair.
I'm sure Takada-kun would love to have you sit in his seat."
<Page28>
Senpai put her bento on her lap instead of on my desk, and begins to eat.
Standing diagonally across from her is Arihiko, who is unwrapping a second loaf of bread.
As watch the two of them, I gaze out the window for no reason at all.
<Page29>
"Huh?　Tono-kun, aren't you going to eat?"
"No, I don't feel like it today."
<Page30>
"You're not eating...... You're going to get hungry then."
"It's fine. I'm more concerned with my health than my appetite. Besides, I'm not so weak that skipping lunch is going to hurt me."
<Page31>
"Wow, that's amazing. I can't move if I skip even one meal. If I do, I get so starved that I collapse.
......It's embarrassing because I eat a lot more than most people, but I still get hungry easily."
<Page32>
"That's not true. You're more developed than the other girls. #......
It's natural that the bigger you are, the less fuel efficient you are."
<Page33>
I'm not sure about what Arihiko said, but he handled the situation well.
Since she is still a teenager, I want her to continue to eat and grow to her full potential.
I can't tell if Senpai is embarrassed or confused by Arihiko's words.
<Page34>
"But Tohno-kun, are you sure you don't mind skipping lunch?"
"I'm fine with it. It's not unusual for me to skip meals for an entire day. I've eaten breakfast today, so I'm good to go until the evening.
<Page35>
"Mmm. I don't think that's a good idea.
You'll ruin your body if you live like that."
<Page36>
"Don't worry, there are people who check up on me.
My doctor has warned me not to put on weight, so it's better for me if I skip a meal now and then.
I want to be strong, but I have to keep my weight down."
<Page37>
"Oh, I see.
Even boys think about dieting, don't they?"
<Page38>
　Senpai looks up at me with an upturned gaze and closes the lid of her lunch box after some thought.
<Page39>
"Well, I just remembered an errand I have to run, so if you'll excuse me.
Oh, please don't worry about me, I'd rather you forget about today's conversation."
<Page40>
After quickly cleaning up, Senpai rushes out of the room like the wind.
<Page41>
"--- Mm, cute."
Arihiko nods his head in satisfaction, clearly impressed by what he had seen.

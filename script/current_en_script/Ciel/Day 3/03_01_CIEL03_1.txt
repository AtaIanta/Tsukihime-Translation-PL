When I enter the classroom, I find that homeroom is about to start
I wasn't used to the road, so I must have paced myself wrong.
The morning chit-chat period is coming to an end, and most of the students have gone back to their desks.
<Page2>
In that situation,
"...... Hello. You've arrived with a lot of time to spare."
Arihiko was standing there with a dejected look on his face, trying to sit in his seat. --He seems to be taking class seriously today.

"Good morning, you don't look very well...#What is it? Are you sick or something?"
<Page4>
"I was full of energy until a while ago. After all, Senpai came to visit me."
"By Senpai you mean.. Ciel-senpai?"
<Page5>
"Yeah. But someone else wasn't here, so she went back to her classroom because she didn't feel like being in the mood. Why are you always so late in the morning, Tohno?"
<Page6>
I didn't know that... If I knew that Senpai was waiting, I'd have come here running.
<Page7>
"Sorry about that. But if we have a chance, we can meet her on our lunch break. It's not like this was the last time."
"Of course not. If this was the last time,
I'd be too shocked to be sitting in a class."
<Page8>
I wave and go to my desk.
As soon as I sit down, the chime rings and Noel-sensei comes into the classroom.
<Page9>
"Hiii, Guud Mornin"
I'm glad to see everyone's in good shape...,#Oh no, there are two absentees. It's the change of season, 
did they get careless and catch a cold?"
<Page10>
Noel-sensei starts taking attendance.
One male student and one female student are absent.
I'm trying to remember who those two empty seats belonged to,
when, by chance, my eyes meet hers.
<Page11>
...
I look away in panic.
I'm sure it's just my imagination, but I think Noel-sensei is looking at me most of the time.

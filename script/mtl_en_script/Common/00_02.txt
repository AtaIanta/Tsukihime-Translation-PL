　When everyone is asleep, I open my eyelids in the cool of the night.
　It's a dark night.
　There is no one in the house.
<Page2>
　The smell of tatami and shoji.
　The sky is like a piece of woodwork.
　An old shadow that seems to have stuck to the corner of the room.
　It is a silence without a single note.
　Even the sound of clothes is lost.
<Page3>
　I stand still and wait for someone in a daze.
　The past is remembered in the sound that has died out.
　The dreams I was having were all about what ifs.
　For example.
<Page4>
　There is no end to the waiting.
　The night is getting darker and darker.
　There must be no one in the house anymore.
　I was afraid to be alone. I wanted to meet everyone.
　I went out to the garden by myself.
<Page5>
　My breath was getting colder and colder.
　It was so cold in the garden that my fingertips were burning.
　Frozen stars.
　The deep darkness.
　The Tsumetaihikari that illuminates the world.
<Page6>
　Overgrown grass. The feeling of stepping on it. The voice of the empty sandals.
　The garden of the house is very wide.
　Surrounded by deep darkness.
　The trees of the forest were black and black and black
　It was like a big curtain.
<Page7>
　It was like some kind of theater.
　My heart was pounding and my throat felt like it would be blocked.
　The window in the treetops opened with a bang.
　I was excited that the play was about to start.
<Page8>
　The sound of insects crawled into my ears.
　There were many sounds in the distance.
　Behind a curtain of dark trees.
　In the forest, everyone is making a lot of noise.
　The curtain hasn't opened yet.
　It doesn't open.
　It won't open.
<Page9>
　I couldn't hold back and went into the forest.
<Page10>
　Very, very much.
　The forest was so deep that even the claws of the sun couldn't reach it.
　There are many sounds.
　There are many things.
　But it was too dark to make out much.
　I can't even remember if I passed someone on the way.
<Page11>
　It's just cold.
　It's a cold winter that makes the back of my eyes go numb.
　I felt someone call my name.
　I walked further in.
<Page12>
　After passing through the veil of trees.
　In the forest square, everyone was waiting together.
　All in uniformed outfits.
　All in disparate poses.
　The whole forest square was completely dark.
<Page13>
　A stranger comes from over there.
　He's coming with a weapon in his hand.
　He wants to tear me apart just like he did everyone else.
<Page14>
　I look at him blankly.
　Waiting helplessly for the murder weapon.
　But when the time is right, someone comes to me.
　And instead, he dismembered me.
<Page15>
　A splash.
　Something warm on my face.
　Hot.
　Water as hot as a tomato.
　The dismembered person.
　That person, her mother...
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page16>
　...... I really don't know.
　It's just cold.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page17>
　I don't want to see the forest because it's too dark.
　I don't want to see the ground because it's too warm.
　So I decided to look up at the sky.
<Page18>
　A warm scarlet color mixes with my eyes.
　It seeps into the back of my eyeballs.
　But it doesn't bother me at all.
　In the night sky, there is only one moon.
<Page19>
　The stranger
　This time he comes to tear me apart.
　The sound of footsteps is coming.
　And yet, I am vaguely
　I'm looking up at the blue shade forever.
<Page20>
　It's so strange.
　I don't know why I didn't notice it until now.
<Page21>
　　　　　Oh ---- tonight so much.
<Page22>
　If you notice, the stranger is right in front of you.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It was in the middle of my chest.
　It's like a veil that opens and dances.
<Page23>
　Nothing can be seen.
　The world is gradually disappearing.
　In the midst of it all, it's shining beautifully.
<Page24>
　Ah... I hadn't noticed.
　It's so beautiful tonight.
　The moon is so beautiful tonight at -------. ---

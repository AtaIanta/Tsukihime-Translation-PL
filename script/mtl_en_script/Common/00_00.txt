<Page1>
　I found myself in a hospital bed.
<Page2>
　The curtains are wavering.
　A chilly breeze flows through the open window.
　The unrestrained colors make you squint unconsciously.
<Page3>
　I don't know where I am.
　When is now?
　What's going on?
　My mind can't keep up.
<Page4>
　When I try to get up, my body jerks before my hands.
　I hold my breath and flap my mouth like a fish.
<Page5>
　This is what they call fire in the eyes.
　As soon as you place your hands on the hard bed, a ripping pain goes through your body.
<Page6>
"----"
　I took a deep breath and lay back to observe my body.
<Page7>
　Both hands are wrapped in bandages.
　My left leg is also wrapped in a white plaster.
　His head is probably bandaged as well, as it is very tight around his forehead.
　On his chest, there is a large, thick bandage to hide something inconvenient.
<Page8>
　There is a tube stuck in his left arm.
　I somehow accept that it is an IV drip.
<Page9>
　Before I woke up, I had been dreaming about my surroundings.
<Page10>
　The room, which was darker and more pharmaceutical than this one.
　The tubes stretching from the bandage on my chest.
　And the scary man in the suit who came to visit me.
　The scary man in the suit who came to visit me, and my sister who came to scold me.
　And my sister who came to scold me.
　I remember it all like a dream.
<Page11>
"What?　You're not awake, are you ......?
　I'm not familiar with the girl's voice.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do.
<Page12>
　The girl rushed out of the room to call for a doctor.
　Flap, flap, flap.
　I know you're in a hurry, but you shouldn't run in a hospital.
<Page13>
"Go to ------."
　I can't raise my body, so I turn my head to look up at the window.
　The core of my eyeballs are chattering.
　It's like a blade is being used to stir the brain.
<Page14>
　The sky is so blue it's almost a lie.
　The blue, without a single spot of stain, was more cruel and painful to my eyes than the white sunlight.
<Page15>
　A few days later.
　For a while after I woke up, I couldn't move from my bed.
<Page16>
　I looked up at the sky, which was still as high as ever.
　The curtains were fluttering.
　The dry wind on my cheeks.
　The blue color, without a single stain, makes my eyes dizzy.
<Page17>
　I don't know where I am, when I am, or why I am in the hospital.
　Why am I in the hospital?
　I'm slowly remembering where I am, when I am, and why I'm in the hospital.
<Page18>
　But one thing.
　I kept staring out the window, feeling like I was forgetting something important, a promise that would bring me to tears.
<Page19>
"Nice to meet you, Tono Shiki. Congratulations on your recovery."
　The first time I saw him, he shook my hand and said so.
<Page20>
　His smile is very kind and his tone is gentle, giving the impression of a well-built man.
　He must be someone who can switch between a smile and a straight face with the flick of a switch.
　The clean and lean white clothes were also perfect for this man.
<Page21>
"Shiki?　Do you understand what the doctor is saying?"
"...... No. Why am I in the hospital?
"You don't remember, do you? You were walking down the street when you were involved in a car accident.
　I got a shard of glass in my chest, and it wasn't a very survivable wound."
<Page22>
　The man in white smiled, but said something that didn't sound like a doctor.
"It wasn't a very survivable wound."
　At his words, the nausea I had been holding in overflows.
<Page23>
"...... I'm sleepy. Can I go to sleep?"
"Yes, you may.
　You need to take it easy now and let your body rest."
<Page24>
　The doctor kept smiling.
　The doctor kept his smile on his face, but I couldn't bear to look at him.
<Page25>
"Doctor, can I ask you something?
"What is it, Shiki?
<Page26>
"Why are there drawings all over your body?
　There are so many cracks in this room, it looks like it's about to fall apart.
<Page27>
　The doctor's smile faltered for just a moment, but he quickly returned to his smiling face and stood up from his chair.
　He clacked and clacked on the floor, disappeared behind the curtains.
<Page28>
"...... It seems that there is something wrong with your brain.
　Contact Dr. Ashiya in the neurosurgery department. I also suspect damage to the optic nerve. Send him for an eye exam this afternoon."
　The doctor spoke secretly to the nurse in a cold voice like a different person.
<Page29>
"'......... It's weird. People have drawings on their bodies.
<Page30>
　The messy lines are stuck all over the hospital.
　I don't know what they mean, but I feel sick just looking at them.
<Page31>
"I wonder what ...... is.
　There is also a postcard on the bed.
　When I touched it with my finger...#I felt my fingertips sink into it.#I'm not sure what to do.
<Page32>
"I'm sure you'll agree.
　If it was thinner, it would have sunk deeper.
　I used a plastic knife from the shelf to trace the graffiti.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page33>
　I was amused, so I slid the knife into the bed, just as I had done.
　Thump.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page34>
"Kyaaaaaah!"
<Page35>
　I turn around at the sound of a voice from behind me.
　There was a nurse standing in front of the door, her face scrunched up.
<Page36>
"'How did you break the bed, Shiki-kun?
　The doctor persistently asked not why I broke the bed, but how I did it.
<Page37>
"'I traced that line and it broke.
　Hey, why is this hospital full of cracks?'
<Page38>
"'Come on, Shiki-kun. There is no such line. So, how did you break the bed? I'm not angry, just tell me.
<Page39>
"So I just traced the lines.
"...... Okay. We'll talk about this tomorrow.
<Page40>
　Sighs the doctor.
　The doctor sighs and sighs.
　The switch must have malfunctioned.
　It seems that this hospital is full of fragile things.
<Page41>
　In the end, no one believed my story.
<Page42>
　When I cut the graffiti with a knife, whatever it was, it cut cleanly.
　I didn't need any muscle power.
　It was as easy as cutting a piece of paper with scissors.
<Page43>
　The bed. A chair. A desk. The wall. The floor, too.
　I've never ...... tried it, but maybe, just maybe, a human being will.
<Page44>
　It seems that everyone can't see the rakugaki.
　You can see the line only you can see.
<Page45>
　I'm sure it's just a splinter.
　After sewing up the wound.
　I think it's a mark that is scattered in pieces just by touching it, like my chest, which has not yet healed even after surgery.
　Because if not, there is no way that a child can cut the wall with his strength.
<Page46>
"---!#---!"
　The nurse is shouting again.
　The wall is cut out unevenly and stares at me.
<Page47>
　Her voice stretches and stretches.
　My ears are going crazy, so I don't feel it's too loud.
　The sound that doesn't stop is like a cicada on fire, and it makes me nervous.
<Page48>
　Everything was in tatters.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
<Page49>
　...... Oh, I didn't know that until now.
　I've never known the world to be so fragile.
　I've never known the world to be so fragile, so full of knots.
<Page50>
　You can't see it.
　I think that's why they're okay with it.
　They don't even notice this abnormal world.
　They don't know about the scars on our lives.
　But I see it.
　I'm so scared I can't walk.
<Page51>
　Speaking of which, my ears have been frozen since then, and although they make noise, they are very quiet.
　Only the wound in my chest sounds like a siren.
　But I wonder if 'that' means 'when'.
　I try to remember, but I can't. You can't get it out even if you scratch your head. It must have been an unimportant matter and I must have thrown it away. It's like a faucet that spills water no matter how much you squeeze it.
<Page52>
　...... Oh, I see.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　It is natural that there is no mirror.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm sure I would have broken it while laughing.
　In other words. It's not the people around me who seem to be breaking down.
　It seems that it is only my story that is broken.
<Page53>
　That's probably why.
　It's been two weeks since then, and no one believes me.
　Two weeks have passed since then, and no one has come to see me.
　Two weeks have passed since then, and yet
　I'm living alone in a world full of jagged edges. ----
<Page54>
　I don't want to be in a hospital room.
　I don't want to be in a place full of rakugaki.
　I want to get away from here.
　I've decided to run away from here and go to a faraway place where no one is around.
<Page55>
　It's not me who's crazy.
　It's not me that's crazy, it's this place, I told myself as I ran away.
<Page56>
　But the wound in my chest was so painful that I could only run a little.
　When I came to my senses.
　I found myself in a field next to a hospital.
　You can't go far wrong with that.
<Page57>
"...... Gosh."
　My chest hurt and I was so sad that I crouched down on the ground and coughed.
<Page58>
　You can't go anywhere, and you shouldn't.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page59>
　Go-ho, go-ho.
　There is no one.
　The end of summer, in the sea of grass.
　I felt like I was going to disappear.
<Page60>
　But before that.
"You. It's not safe to squat like that.
　A woman's voice reached my ears loud and clear.
<Page61>
"What .........?"
"It's not like that.
　You're too small to see if you're crouched in the grass. Be careful, you could have been kicked out of the house.
<Page62>
　The woman pointed at me in a pouting manner.
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for a great deal more than just a great deal more.
<Page63>
"Who's going to kick you out?
Who's going to run you off?" "That's obvious, silly.
　It's just you and me in here, so who else is going to be there?
　The woman crossed her arms and said confidently.
<Page64>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page65>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　You can find no reason to refuse, so I gave my name as Tono Shiki and grabbed my palm back as if I were being sucked in.
<Page66>
　I really enjoyed chatting with the woman.
　This person does not ignore what I say because I am a child.
　She listened to me as a human being.
<Page67>
　We talked about many things.
　About my family. It was an old family with a long history, and my father was a strict man who was particular about etiquette.
<Page68>
　That I had a younger sister named Akiha who was very quiet and always followed me around.
<Page69>
　Because it was a big house, I always played with Akiha and her friends in the forest-like garden.
<Page70>
　The attic was a secret place. I was getting bad at Shiritori. She was still expected to grow taller.
<Page71>
　I used to love the smell of the hospital, but somehow it had become my weakness.
　The cloudless blue sky is so beautiful, but when I look at it, I feel like crying.
　But it's wonderful to be alive, and I don't dislike that doctor with his fake smile.
<Page72>
　---Really.
　I talked about many things as if I were in a fever.
<Page73>
"Oops, it's already time.
　I'm sorry, Shiki. I have some business to attend to, so let's end the conversation here.
<Page74>
　The woman walks away.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page75>
"You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　You can also go back to the hospital room and obey the doctor's orders properly.
<Page76>
"Oh..."
　The woman left as if it was a matter of course.
<Page77>
"...... See you tomorrow.
　Tomorrow, we can talk again like today.
　I'm glad. For the first time since I woke up from the accident, my human emotions have returned.
<Page78>
　In the afternoon, it became a routine to go to the field.
　Women get upset when I call them Aoko. She said she didn't like her name.
　After much deliberation, I decided to call her "Sensei" because she seemed to be an important person.
<Page79>
　He listens to me earnestly and solves my problems with a few words.
<Page80>
　After the accident, I had become uncomfortable talking to people, but thanks to him, I was able to gradually return to my normal self.
<Page81>
　Only when I was in this field, my anxiety disappeared because I was my original self.
　So, I don't know who or where he is, but maybe he really is a teacher at some school.
<Page82>
　But that's a what if that has nothing to do with me.
　I enjoy being with my teacher.
　The important thing is that it's that simple.
<Page83>
"Hey, Sensei. I can do something like this."
　I wanted to surprise him a little, so I cut a tree in the field with the knife I took from the hospital.
<Page84>
　I traced the lines that looked like caricatures and cut out half of the tree from the middle, as if I were tearing a piece of paper.
<Page85>
"It's amazing. It's easy to cut anywhere where you can see the graffiti. No one else can do that."
<Page86>
"------"
　The teacher was amazed.
　I got good at it, and now I put my knife into the base of the tree, in a straight horizontal line.
<Page87>
"Shiki...!
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page88>
"Ahead ...... of you?"
"Stop it. You've just done a very rash thing.
<Page89>
　The teacher stares at you with serious eyes.
　It's a relentless look. An unwavering eye that punishes the wrongdoers.
<Page90>
　Oh, what a fool I was.
　I've been enjoying this time so much.
　I forgot about myself.
<Page91>
　This postcard shouldn't be there.
　I should not be alive to see it.
<Page92>
"------"
　A bloody regret that stains the chest.
　I want to die of my own stupidity.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I wanted my teacher to praise me, so I destroyed it for no reason.
<Page93>
"...... Sorry, sir.
　You will find yourself shedding tears.
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your vacation.
<Page94>
"I'm sure you'll agree.
　A soft sensation.
　The teacher hugged a person like me, with a knife, as a matter of course.
<Page95>
"You don't need to apologize.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to use it for a lot of things.
"......?　I'm not the only one to blame. ......?
<Page96>
"I'm sure you're right. I'm not sure what to say. In the event that you're in the market for a brand new pair of shoes or boots, then you're in the right place.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　As a person in the same position, I gave my opinion, got angry, and really hit you. In the event that you have any questions regarding where and how to use the internet, please do not hesitate to contact us.
<Page97>
　Those words were really scary.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page98>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not going to apologize for that either.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　...... Yes. In return, you can hate me.
<Page99>
"......No. I don't hate you.
"Yeah. I'm really glad.
　...... I think this is why I met you.
<Page100>
　And then.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page101>
"...... Shiki, what you are seeing is real.
　You'll be able to get a lot more than that.
　It's not an illusion.
　That line is not an illusion, it is a reality that belongs only to you."
<Page102>
"...... I see.
　So I'm the only one who's crazy.
"Yes, you're crazy. There's no way to cheat that.
<Page103>
　I hold myself back from crying.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page104>
　But that's what I knew.
　From the very beginning, I knew I was a child who shouldn't be there, from the moment I woke up.
<Page105>
"Don't be so quick. The abnormality is only strange, not inexplicable.
　People can go for anything if it makes sense...that's my rule of thumb.
　No matter how ridiculous the bullshit that comes our way, we can overcome it with wisdom and courage.
<Page106>
　Lesson number one, said the teacher, a little embarrassed.
　Even if there are abnormal things, that itself is not the problem.
　It is how you deal with it that is the problem.
<Page107>
"So, can you explain ...... this camouflage?
"Of course. All things have their fragile parts.
<Page108>
"We will break someday, but we are not perfect because we break.
　Your eyes see the end ...... of such things, or in other words, they see the future.
"You're ...... seeing the future?
<Page109>
"Yes. You don't need to know any more than that for now.
　If the time comes when you go along with the flow, you will inevitably know the logic of it.
<Page110>
"'Dr. ....... I don't know what you're talking about.
"No, you don't. There's only one thing that matters now. That line should never be cut unnecessarily.
　---Your eyes make life too easy for you.
<Page111>
"Yes. I won't do it if you say so.
　Besides, I feel kind of sick to my chest. ...... I'm sorry, doctor. I'll never do that again.
<Page112>
"...... Thank goodness.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. This is a great way to make sure you get the most out of your vacation.
<Page113>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page114>
"But doctor. I'm worried when I see this drawing. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.　If that's the case, then everything around me could fall apart at any moment.
<Page115>
"I'll take care of that problem.
　I'll take care of that problem, it seems that's why I'm here.
<Page116>
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page117>
"It's a good idea. I'm not sure what to do with it.
　I will bring you back to your old life."
<Page118>
　The next day.
　The next day, seven days after we met, the teacher came to the field with a large trunk in his hand.
<Page119>
He said, "Yes. If you wear this, you won't be able to see any more of those strange postcards.
<Page120>
　What he offered me was a pair of plain glasses.
<Page121>
"I'm not blind," he said.
"Just put them on. They don't have any lenses.
<Page122>
　The teacher forced me to put on the glasses.
　And then...
<Page123>
"Whoa!　Wow, that's amazing, Sensei!
　I can't even see the graffiti!
"Of course you can. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. I'm not sure what to do.
<Page124>
"I'm not sure what to do.　I'm not sure what to say.
　It's like magic.
"That's natural. I'm a magician.
<Page125>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page126>
"It's a good idea. It's not that the line has disappeared. It's just that it's invisible. You can see the line again if you take off your glasses.
"Invisible?"
<Page127>
"Yes. There's nothing you can do about that. You'll just have to live with it.
<Page128>
"......... No. I don't want this horrible eye.
　If I cut that line again, I won't be able to keep my promise to you.
<Page129>
"Oh, the one about never cutting the line again?
　Oh, you're so stupid, you can break a promise like that all you want.
"...... Is that right?　You said it was a very bad idea.
<Page130>
"Yes, it's wrong.
　Yes, it's wrong, but you don't depend on anyone else for that eye, it's your power.
　So it's up to you to try to use it. No one else can blame you for having the eye.
　The only thing that can be questioned is what you did with your power, Shiki.
<Page131>
"What I... do..."
<Page132>
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page133>
"I'm not sure what to say. This is a great way to get the most out of your money.
　I'll be honest with you. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. I mean, you look like you've lost a lot of stuff.
　But there's nothing wrong with you. You're alive. Then spend your life trying to get it back."
<Page134>
"------"
　---In the event that you've got a lot of time, you'll be able to take a look at this kind of.
"You can stay here," he said.
　It's the most powerful and affirmed me than anyone else.
<Page135>
"Shiki. You have a very unique ability among the abilities possessed by individuals. But the fact that you have it means that it has some kind of meaning.
　God doesn't share his power for no reason. There is a time in your future when you will need it, so you can say that you have the direct eye of death. I know it's cruel, but...
<Page136>
"So don't forget that. You have a very straightforward heart.
　As long as you are now, that eye will never produce a wrong result.
<Page137>
"I'm not asking you to be a saint. I don't want to tell you to be a saint, I just want you to be the adult you think is right.
　If you can accept that something is wrong and say you are sorry, you will be a wonderful boy in ten years.
<Page138>
　The teacher stood up and reached into the trunk.
<Page139>
"But don't take off your glasses unless you're sure you're ready. A special power calls for a special power.
　Yes, my advice to you, that.
　Think carefully about where you're going to foul and where you're going to win.
　I hope it doesn't come to that, but only take off your glasses when you decide it's out of your control, and use your power with care.
<Page140>
"The power itself is not a bad thing.
　It is up to you to decide whether the outcome will be a good one or a bad one.
<Page141>
　The trunk is lifted.
　---Although the doctor does not say anything.
　I now know that this is goodbye.
<Page142>
"I can't do this, doctor. I can't make it good by myself.
　I was really scared until I met you. But because you were there, I was able to be me again.
　You can't ...... do that. If you're not sure what to do, you can always ask your doctor. ......!
<Page143>
"I'm not sure what to say. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page144>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family.
<Page145>
"You know what you're doing, don't you?　You know that you are going to be fine.
　If you're not sure what you're looking for, you can always ask me.
<Page146>
"I'll be back. It's a good idea.
　You'll find a lot of pitfalls in the life of any human being.
　You have the ability to manage it, so you should be more diligent.
<Page147>
　The teacher goes away.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website and see if you can find anything you like.
<Page148>
"Yeah. Goodbye, teacher."
<Page149>
"Good, good, good. Keep up the good work and be well.
　One last lesson. When you're in a pinch, you need to calm down, and then you need to think.
　Don't worry. You'll do just fine on your own.
　The teacher smiles happily.
<Page150>
　A gust of wind blew.
　The grass shakes all at once.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page151>
"...... Bye, teacher.
　It was the first time I had seen him and I knew I would never see him again.
<Page152>
　The only things that remain are a lot of words and these mysterious glasses.
　It was only seven days, but it taught me the most important thing.
<Page153>
　As I stood there in a daze, tears welled up in my eyes.
　---Oh, what a fool I am.
　All I do is say goodbye.
　I hadn't even said thank you to her.
<Page154>
　I was discharged from the hospital soon after that.
　After I was released from the hospital, I was sent to another home instead of Tono's.
<Page155>
　Although my body had recovered, I was still suffering from the aftereffects of the disease, and I had become an unwanted child for Tono's family.
　But it's okay.
　Tono Shiki can do fine on his own.
<Page156>
　He will lead a new life with a new family.
　I leave the hospital room where I spent the summer of my tenth year.
<Page157>
　The curtains are still wavering.
　I squint my eyes once at the too-blue sky.
　A gentle breeze announces the end of summer.

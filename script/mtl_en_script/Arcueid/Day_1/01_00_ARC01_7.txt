　In contrast to the white-based living room, there was a red-based space.

　The nanny's name is Amber.

　The only ones left are yourself and two girls you don't recognize.
<Page5>
　Mr. Amber gave me a small bow and left the room as well.

"I'm not sure what to say. I've heard of you, but your health is really unstable. I'll waste your time, but would you like to rest before I talk to you?"
　...... And.
　Akiha's words seemed to have a certain sting to them.
<Page12>
"I'm not sure what to say, but I'm sure you'll understand. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page13>
"....... If seven years pass, it will change. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. Or did you think that you would always be the same as before, brother?
"''---No, it's---''
　I was overwhelmed by the quiet power of it, and I couldn't stop myself from saying it.
<Page14>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for a great deal more than just a great deal more.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with your family.
　How did the seven years of time make Akiha grow up? It's not as if it's rude to think about it in front of him.
<Page15>
"You can find a lot more information at ....... To be honest, I didn't think about it enough.
　But then again, Akiha has changed. It's a lot more beautiful than it used to be.
　I can honestly say that.
<Page16>
"Thank you very much.
　I'm sure my brother hasn't changed much from before.

<Page19>
　It's only a few seconds of silence, as if searching for each other's way out.
　I can't think of a casual way to greet my reunited sister.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family and friends.
<Page20>
"I'm not sure what to say, but I'm going to say it.
　If you are in good physical condition, you can finish the conversation.
　Have you heard of any detailed circumstances regarding this relocation?"
<Page21>
"'No, nothing in detail. I'm not sure what to make of it. You can find out about Makihisa's death in the newspapers.
<Page22>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what's going on in your life.
　In the event that you have a son who has been disowned, you can find out about his parents' misfortune on news sites.
　The news of Makihisa Tono's death was delivered to the Arima family after his funeral was over.
<Page23>
He said, "I am sorry for ....... It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

<Page25>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　It's not like the dead will come back to life if I go. On the contrary, I'm glad I didn't meet any relatives."
　The disowned son is in a complicated position in many ways.
<Page26>
"...... I see.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.

　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family and friends.

　I'm not sure what to say goodbye to Makihisa, I can't think of a single thing, I have no right or obligation to see the deceased off.
<Page28>
"But then, who called me back?
　It's not like it was my father's will, is it?
<Page29>
"''It was my decision to call your brother back here.
　Isn't it strange that the eldest son of Tono is kept in Arima's house forever?　Whatever your faults, you are a Tono man.
<Page30>
"..............."
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　You can find a lot more than just a few of them.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page31>
"Father ......, since Makihisa Tono has passed away, the only bloodline of Tono is me and my brother.

<Page34>
"You don't have that kind of freedom. There are a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　Both my brother and I were raised by the Tohno family. You are obligated to remain in servitude to the Tohno family, at least until you reach adulthood and become socially independent."
<Page35>
".................."
　That's what Makihisa said.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page36>
　In the event that you have any kind of questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　This not only damages the name of the family, but also lowers the quality of the entire country.
<Page37>
　Those who cannot take that responsibility are not qualified to be parents, and children who cannot live up to that responsibility have no reason to be a family.
　Makihisa Tono told this story to me and Akiba many times. It was as if he was telling it to himself, over and over again.
<Page38>
"It was a habit of Makihisa's.
　Then the reason why you called me back is simply because..."
　I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one who's been disowned by my bigoted father.
<Page39>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　Do you think there is any other reason?"
　As the head of the Tono family, he just took care of the matter that had been left unattended.
<Page40>
"I'm glad you understand that.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. In the family register, you are my brother, but the hierarchical relationship in this family is different.
<Page41>
"Brother. I will respect you as my brother, but at the same time, as the one who is in charge of this house, I will treat you as the property of the Tono family.
　I'm sure you'll agree with me.
<Page42>
　Akiba's voice was indifferent.
　I'm not sure what to make of it. It is true that I felt something cold there.
　But...
<Page43>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　I'll feel better if you say it clearly."
　This is a natural ending.
　It's nothing to be upset about.
<Page44>
"...... Do you understand my words?
　I think I unilaterally declared that I was above your brother and that you should accept it. ......"
<Page45>
"'I know and I'm not complaining. Because no matter how you think about it, I'm going to be treated this way, now.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
"....................."
<Page46>
"I'm not sure what to make of that. Wasn't it the relatives who suggested that I stay with the Arima family?
<Page47>
"Yes, they did. But the current head of the family is me. I have rejected all the advice of my relatives.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website and see if you can find anything you like.
<Page48>
"------"
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're going to be doing and how you're going to do it.
　...... No.
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it. As a household and brother, I'm a little scared of my sister's rapid growth.
<Page49>
"...... brother?
　What is it about your face that makes you look so gloomy?
<Page50>
"Ah, no, I'm impressed, or rather, moved ......, you've really been recognized as the head of the family.
"─ Of course. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to call your brother back."
<Page51>
"I'll go back to that.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. You will refrain from misbehaving as you have done in the past, so please keep that in mind.
<Page52>
"Hmm?　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's not like I can go back to being a well-behaved person now, and I don't want to.
<Page53>
"No, no matter what happens, you will go back.
　You're not a child and you can whine before you even try.

"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.#　I mean, you could do that. ......!
<Page61>
"Yes, please don't worry about it.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. Sooner or later, I was going to ask them to leave the house.
　Oh, I've given most of the servants time off, but I've left me and my brother's men behind, so there's no problem.
<Page62>
"'No, no problem is too much, isn't it?　If you do anything like that, you'll be brought up for questioning at the next relatives meeting!
<Page63>
"Please don't complain about it.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money to spend, you'll be able to take advantage of it.
<Page64>
　.......
　Well, it really does make you feel better,.......
<Page65>
"...... No, but, you know, is that really what you want?
　Even my father didn't go against the opinions of his relatives, but he went through such a tyrannical selfishness .......
<Page66>
"That's right. This is the reason why your father entrusted your brother to the Arima family. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. I don't want to hear any more of their nonsense.
"I'm sorry, Akiba..."
<Page67>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.

　---- jade."
<Page70>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page71>
　The girl called Jade stepped forward and bowed towards me.
　It was an expressionless but polite bow, a crystallization of sincerity.
<Page72>
"This is Jade, our servant.
　From now on, she will be your brother's maidservant, is that correct?"
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page73>
"I'm sure you'll understand.
"I'm sure you'll be pleased to hear that.
<Page74>
　...... I can't believe it.

"I'm not sure what to say. Isn't it too exaggerated to be a servant or something?　I'm sure you'll be able to figure out how to get the best out of it. ......
"I'm sure you'll agree.

<Page80>
"'Oh, and your brother. Even if you are the eldest son, there are certain things that are forbidden in this mansion, places that you should not enter. Please do not violate them.
　I've also ordered Jade to protect your brother, so please listen to Jade's advice as much as possible.
<Page81>
"Isn't that called being a watchdog, not a guardian?
"If your brother lives a regular life, Jade will be freed from such a role.

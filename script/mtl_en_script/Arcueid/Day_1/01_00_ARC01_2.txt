　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to do it.
　When the main gate came into view, it was almost 7 o'clock.
　Students on their way to club activities were walking quickly past the main gate.
　They must be trying to use up the limited time they have until 8:00 when HR starts.
<Page2>
　Tokyo Metropolitan Soya High School.
　This year marks the 40th anniversary of the school's founding, and it's a good old school building.
　It is a very average high school with a modest percentage of students going on to higher education, moderate club activities, and a reasonable amount of freedom in the school rules.
<Page3>
　The only complaint from the male students is a very common one, "I want you to improve the old-fashioned design of the uniform," but this complaint goes unheeded.
　On the other hand, only the female students' uniform was changed three years ago.
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where and the best way to get in touch with us, please do not hesitate to contact us.
<Page4>
"I'm sure you'll agree.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with us.
　This morning was somewhat hectic.
<Page5>
　The teachers are running to the staff room with blue faces.
　A black car parked in the parking lot for the first time.
　The cold sky.
　I imagine a funeral with no one in attendance or a whale of a curtain that goes on and on for no reason.
<Page6>
　...... I sigh at the dark thoughts.
　I decided to shake off my bad premonition and head to the classroom.
<Page7>
　I walk into an empty classroom.
　You'll be able to sit in your own chair and kill time until your morning HR.
　As you do your prep work with an auspicious mindset, the classroom becomes more and more popular.
<Page8>
"Good morning. Today's morning practice is about to end.
"I'm not sure what to make of that.　Isn't Tono early?
"Oh, that's right, volunteers!
　But was it today?　Oh no, I might have skipped it!
<Page9>
　Compared to other classrooms, students in 2-C get along well with each other.
　It's a great way to get to know your fellow students.
<Page10>
　It's a great way to get to know your classmates.
　We discuss everything from last night's Internet news, which has been consumed to the point where there's no room for debate, to new information about the school that happened just ten minutes ago, as if it were confirmation.
<Page11>
　It's just communication to fill the time, but it's a necessary part of our routine.
　It's a light preparation exercise before the day begins.
　In this day and age of information overload, it would be exhausting for both us and the other person if we were to engage in serious dialogue at all times.
<Page12>
　Suddenly, the atmosphere in the classroom changed.
　What had been harmonious chatter has turned into hushed whispering.
<Page13>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　You're blocking the road! You're blocking the road!
　The vicious dialogue that does not consider classmates as classmates echoes.
　You don't have to look to confirm. The air in the classroom has changed because of the arrival of this...
<Page14>
"Cheeeeese!　GUMMONIN' glasses!
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
"..............."
　It is the fault of the delinquent students who have deviated from the idyllic colors of our school.
<Page15>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.　In fact, don't you at least feel like saying thank you for being here since morning?
<Page16>
"No, I don't. It's just that I'm disgusted to see your thick face from this morning.
　In the first place, there is no thank you. You're not the reason I'm at school.
<Page17>
"What?　Don't be silly, I'm at school for you!　That's not fair!
"............"
　I'm speechless.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page18>
　Orange dyed hair, ear piercing.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　In this day and age when the culture of delinquent students has died out, he is a free spirited outlaw who sells his violence.
　This is the man, Inui Arihiko.
<Page19>
"......Well, that's okay. It's a good thing to come to class in the morning.
　Good morning, Arihiko. Have you finally started to care about your attendance?
<Page20>
"No, I'm not worried about that. There's still plenty of time for that.
It's just that I can't slack off because my sister is home today.
　I've been working all night, so I'm at my limit.
"I see. I'm sorry, let me redo my greeting.
　Good night, Kuzuhiko. Hurry up to your desk and get some sleep.
<Page21>
"Gee, what a cold reaction.
　That's your attitude towards your enemy from middle school?　I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.
<Page22>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. Don't bother with it too much.
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page23>
"I'm not sure why, but Tono's only cold to me.
　He's like a saint to the rest of us, but he's so unfair.
"You know what I'm talking about.
　Nothing's fair in this world.
<Page24>
"That's true, but...
　But you're really cold to me, aren't you?
<Page25>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It is not that I am consciously trying to be cold, it is just that we have become naturally distant from each other as a result of our honest conversations without hesitation.
　You can find a lot of different hobbies and tastes, but you may find that you are on the same wavelength somehow.
<Page26>
"You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a bit, well, not quite normal.
<Page27>
"Well, I think so too.
　It's not just about waking up and coming to school. To be honest, I want to go home. Hmm, do students really need to have the will to study?
<Page28>
　That's exactly right, but when this man says it, I feel that it's admirable just to come to school even if I don't have any intention.
<Page29>
"You can discuss this in a mirror next time you are free.
　What I want to ask you is why you don't go to town. If you want to kill time at a karaoke bar or a manga cafe, why not go there?
"It's just that. It is because something is noisy these days.
　It's not free to do rough work, and I only want to show up there when I have the energy.
<Page30>
"Disturbing ......?"
"Oh. You know Tono, right?
　I'm talking about the street burglary case that's been circulating so loudly. There are cops patrolling the center street in front of the station at night.
"I see. I remember when there was such a story.
<Page31>
　I remembered when Arihiko told me.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to take advantage of it.
　I'm sure it was covered in the news.
　I think it was...
<Page32>
"I don't know what it was, but it was a very vulgar sales pitch.
　"Late night street crime, right?"
<Page33>
"A series of bizarre murders. The victims were usually young women, and Hotoke, who was found two days ago, was the eighth. And all of them have scars on their throats.
　What the hell is that?
　I can't imagine what the situation is like at all.
<Page34>
"No, Inui-kun. Everyone who's been killed has lost a lot of blood in their bodies.
<Page35>
　I'm not sure if we were talking too loudly, but Yumizuka, who was nearby, came over and corrected me.
<Page36>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　Thank you, Yumizuka, good morning!
<Page37>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　In the event that you have any kind of questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can contact us at the web site.
<Page38>
"You know a lot, don't you, Yumizuka-san?
"No, I'm not!
　It's a case that's happening in this city, and if you watch the news, you're bound to remember it.
<Page39>
"That's what I'm talking about, Tono.
　You'll be able to find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing. I'm seriously staying up late at home these days.
<Page40>
"I don't know why you did that.
　I'm surprised that you are so sane. It's not like you to stay home in fear of a murderer.
<Page41>
"It's not unlike you. Most people are scared of a murderer.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. I definitely don't want to do that. I don't want to throw my life away yet.
"...... Oh, I see. I'm sure you're right. If you're targeted, you have no choice but to go along with it to the bitter end.
<Page42>
"You. I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.
　Why do you have to go along with it all the way?
"What?　Because in that case, you can't escape, right?
<Page43>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　The truth is, I don't care about murderers either. I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out.　It's bad luck to run into them.
　The reason I don't go out on the town is more practical. Lately, there's been a new breed of idiots in front of the north exit. To be honest, I don't even want to see their faces.
<Page44>

<Page45>
"I'm sure you've heard of them.
"It's like a test of courage. You can get into the underground passage from the secret entrance, and if you reach the end, you can get a lot of money.
<Page46>
"I've heard of that too, but ...... it's just a ghost story, isn't it?
<Page47>
"Yeah. I heard it was an urban legend that has been around for quite some time.
　There are idiots who make it sound like a money-making story and use it. I don't know where the newcomers came from, but thanks to them, the air quality at the north entrance is terrible. The slightest thing can start a fistfight.
<Page48>
"I don't like pain, basically.　The police will probably move in if you do something that loud, so I'm staying home for a while until they catch you.
<Page49>
　The urban legends of the north entrance ...... are unfamiliar to me, as I am not a local.
　I'm not sure if that's ...... going to be a stranger from today.
<Page50>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　So, is that it, or did you collapse from anemia this morning?
<Page51>
"No, I'm still fine this morning.
　It's nice of you to worry about me, but I can't take it if I'm anemic all the time.
"Yeah, you're right. If Tono says he's fine, then he's probably fine.
<Page52>
"Come on, class is about to start. Go back to your seat and get some sleep.
"Aye. ....... Oh, yeah. I'll be having lunch in the cafeteria today. I've invited a special guest to surprise you, so look forward to it.
<Page53>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page54>
"I'm not sure what to do.
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to do with it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page55>
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　In the event that you've got a lot of time, you'll be able to take a look at the following
<Page56>
"'Oh no!　You're going to study math on your own today!
　Someone in the class shouted in triumph.
<Page57>
　Tohyama-sensei is a math teacher.
　If she is absent, today's class will be self-study. The rest of the time can be used freely as long as you complete the assigned printouts.
　Some students use it to study, some use it to play.
<Page58>
　I started to work on my math problem book.
　When I was a child, I was told that it would be difficult for me to enter a famous school with my body, so I stopped going to cram schools in junior high school, but I found studying interesting.
　Whether you go on to higher education or out into the world, having knowledge is never a waste.
　After solving a few application problems, I looked up and saw the students in the hallway.
<Page59>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page60>
"I knew it. ......"
"I can't believe it. ......
"During morning practice, the teachers turned bloodthirsty in the staff room. ......
"It's just a rumor.
"But it's so easy.
"Oh, my God. How did that happen? ......
　I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page61>
"Yesterday's events.
"Two guys in the principal's office who looked like detectives.
　I try to build up a tolerance for what is said next.
　It's something I'm used to, but I breathe in and wait for the words to come so that I don't pass them off as natural.
<Page62>
"So...Tohyama, I heard he died yesterday."
　I closed my vision gently, as if swallowing a headache.
<Page63>
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page64>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　Some were in the cafeteria, some were in the courtyard, and some were still in their classrooms, spreading out their lunches.
　Now, where should I have my lunch?
C:>I'll meet up with Arihiko in the cafeteria.
C:>I'll stay in the classroom and see what happens.
C:>I'll think about it when I get to the hallway.

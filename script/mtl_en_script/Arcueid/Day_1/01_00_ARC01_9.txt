　Dinner was served face to face with Akiba.
　Jade and Amber-san devoted themselves to serving us.
　The master and the servants do not gather around the dinner table.
　It's ...... natural, but it was an uncomfortable dinner for me because I was used to the group at Arima's house.
<Page2>
　In addition, I completely forgot about table manners.
　Humans are optimizers who put unused memories in the corner of their minds. In other words, there's no reason for me to remember table manners.
<Page3>
　It's really a thrilling experience to see Akiba's eyebrows raise at my every move.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time with your family and friends. ...... To be honest, it's a bit daunting to think about this happening every day.
<Page4>
　The dinner was over without any conversation.
　I was so busy trying to remember my table manners that I didn't have time for conversation.
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.

<Page8>
"What exactly is ...... that?
"The first thing to do is to improve your lifestyle. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. The curfew is set at eight o'clock.
　If you do go out, for any reason, you must ask permission from me, Amber or Jade.
<Page9>
"Is ......?
　8:00 curfew?　Nowadays?　No, before that, you need someone's permission to go outside?
"Wait, wait, wait, that's...
<Page10>
"I'll set up a study schedule for the holidays.
　According to the report, your brother's grades are in the middle of the pack.
　......
At all. As usual, he seems to be good at cutting corners efficiently.
"No way. I always do my best.

　It's hard to overestimate my sister.
　It's also scary to see how carefully they are researching my grades.
<Page13>
"I'm not sure what to do with it.
　So long, brother. ---Please give me the main topic, the thing.
"Yes?"
　What's the main thing?
<Page14>
When I say "thing," I mean "thing.
　You have it. In your pants, too. That filthy thing that's the symbol of youth.
　I'm telling you, don't hide it.
<Page15>
"No, I don't understand!
　Is this what the upper classes do?　What do you think the general public is, man?
<Page16>
"What?　So give me your mobile device.
　You have a mobile device, don't you, brother?

"I'm sure you'll agree. This kind of electronic device is prohibited in our house. Because they are unnecessary for healthy students.
　If you want to use the phone, use the one provided in the lobby. If you want to do some research, please use the library."
<Page19>
　Ending the conversation one-sidedly, Akiha walked out of the cafeteria.
<Page20>
　I stood there in shock for the first time today, and the biggest shock of all.
　It's not that I'm a sore loser, but I'm not the type of person who uses a cell phone that much.
　I just check my email or read the news when I'm waiting. But the fact that mobile devices are a basic element of life is no different than any other human being.
<Page21>
　Once again, I shudder at the strictness of Tono's house. I can't believe that in this internet society, there was a house that banned mobile devices. ......!

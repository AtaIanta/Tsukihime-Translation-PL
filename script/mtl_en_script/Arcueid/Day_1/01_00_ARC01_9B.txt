<Page5>
　A woven wooden basket was placed by the foot of the bed.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web.
　...... It's becoming more and more like a luxury hotel.
<Page6>
"Do you have any questions for me?"
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page7>
"I don't really have anything to say about it, do you mind?
"Yes, what is it?"
"I'd like to know what kind of work you and Amber do here, if you don't mind.
<Page8>
"I am in charge of Shiki-sama, and my sister Amber is in charge of Lady Akiba. I'm not sure what to make of that.
"I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page9>
　I'm not sure what to say.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　There is no such thing as a hobby to be taken care of by a girl of about the same age, at least not yet.
<Page10>
"...... With Shiki-sama, does that mean you are my personal servant?
"I'm sure you'll agree. I'm not sure what to do.
　You can find a lot more than just a few things to do.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page11>
"I'm not sure what to do. It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web, as well as to make sure that you're getting the most out of it. I'll be grateful for your help, but---"
<Page12>
"Is there anything in particular you want from me?
It's not that big of a deal. ...... You know, I'm not really a "Shiki-sama" person.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page13>

　I'm not sure what to do with it.
<Page15>
".................."
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　...... I'm sorry.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think it's a good idea.
<Page16>
"But, sir, you are my employer.
"I'm not your employer, am I?
<Page17>
"'...... With all due respect. It's the same thing, Shiki-sama.
　I'm not sure what to do with it. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　Therefore, please address me only as Jade.
　I hope you can understand the feelings of a servant who is called by an honorific title by the person he serves."
<Page18>
"Mmmm."
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page19>
"...... Haha. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page20>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.
"Yes. I'll do whatever I can to make it that way.
"............ haha."
It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page21>
"I'm sure you'll agree. I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your money. I'd appreciate it if you could tell your sister Amber that as well.

<Page23>
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
　As soon as you're alone, the exhaustion rushes in.
　...... Too many things have happened since this morning.
　I'm not sure what to say, but I'm sure you'll understand.
<Page24>
　Turn off the lights and lie down in bed.
　The desire for sleep is like a drug.
　My exhausted body drains the vitality from my limbs and forces me to fall asleep.
<Page25>
　Against this temptation, I keep my eye lids closed, but it's a futile resistance.
　No matter how much I don't want to sleep, I will eventually fall asleep.
　The human body is made in such a way.
<Page26>
　......While in between wakefulness and sleep, I gazed at the ceiling in a daze.
<Page27>
　......The house after seven years.
　......The family members for the first time in seven years.
　I'm not sure what to say. ...... I feel like it's someone else's house.
"But you're back, aren't you?
　...... monologue to accept that fact.
<Page28>
　The ...... consciousness sinks to depths from which there is no turning back.
　...... A mansion on high ground where the bustle of the city does not reach.
　......An isolated island of land surrounded by tall trees.
　A moment after closing the ...... eye lid, I came to realize that it was like a prison, even after all this time.

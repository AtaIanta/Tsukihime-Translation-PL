　The main gate is tightly closed.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you're going to need to be able to pay for it.
<Page2>
　All of the land on the hill overlooking the city is managed by the Tono family.
　The site is bigger than our high school, and if you include the forest that spreads out behind it, it's probably three times as big.
<Page3>
　The property is surrounded by a long wall and trees, so you can't see inside.
　The main gate, which is the entrance, is closed as if to refuse anyone who comes.
<Page4>
　Next to the gate for cars, there is a doorway for humans.
　After a moment's hesitation, he pressed a button that appeared to be a doorbell.
<Page5>
　There was no ringing sound to be heard by the person who pressed the button, as with a normal intercom.
　After a few seconds of waiting, the doorway was unlocked with a mechanical sound that said, "Please enter.
<Page6>
"...... The door here is now fully automatic. There used to be a guard ......."
<Page7>
　Open the heavy door and enter the premises. Through the stone gate.
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time with your family.
<Page8>
　After passing through the main gate, a gently sloping path stretched deeper and deeper.
　Surrounded by tall trees, the path reminded me of a tunnel.
　The path goes straight to the east and then turns at a right angle to the north after about 40 meters.
<Page9>
"------"
　With each step, memories come flooding back to color.
　I know this road.
　I've run down this road many times.
<Page10>
　Almost there.
　If you reach that corner and turn your feet to the north side, to the left, you will find
<Page11>
　Tono's mansion, reminiscent of a chalk wall, is rising.
　Oh, and. You can also take a sigh of admiration and resignation.
<Page12>
　The house has not changed at all from those days.
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page13>
　This is the castle of a powerful man who has been in this land for more than hundreds of years.
　It's a great way to get to know the people in the area.
<Page14>
　I remember at the annual relatives meeting, a lot of adults were trying to get my father to rent a corner of the mansion.
<Page15>
　They would have been successful businessmen with their own mansions, but for some reason they were obsessed with living here.
　For them, living in this land must have been like a foil.
　...... It's really ridiculous. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're going to be doing.
<Page16>
"............... Well...
　You can't turn back if you've come this far.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the best results.
<Page17>
　I shook off my nervousness and pushed the doorbell.
　There is no familiar sound like a ping pong.
<Page18>
　A heavy silence lingers for several seconds.
　From the other side of the door, I hear the sound of hurried footsteps.
<Page19>
"Yes, I've been waiting for you.
　Despite its heavy appearance, the door was opened lightly.
<Page20>
　I squinted at the sunlight streaming in through the window.
　I was prepared for this, but I took a breath and looked around the vast lobby.
<Page21>
　The ...... architectural beauty overwhelms the visitor.
　You'll feel like you've slipped back in time to a different country, a different era. The interior of the mansion was so dated that even the atmosphere was different.
<Page22>
　Still, this is the familiar lobby of the Tono residence.
<Page23>
　In front of me standing there is a girl in anachronistic clothes who came to welcome me.
<Page24>
"I'm glad. It's so late, I was worried you might have wandered off.
　If you hadn't arrived when the sun went down, we would have come to pick you up.
　The girl wearing a kimono and apron is smiling and laughing.
<Page25>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page26>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
<Page27>
"You're Shiki-sama, right?
"I'm not sure. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
<Page28>
"I'm sure you're right.　Please don't scare me again.
　I'm afraid I've made a mistake again, you know?
<Page29>
　The girl in the apron pressed her forefinger to her lips in a gesture that resembled a mother scolding her child.
　It seems that she is really worried and angry. In the event that you have any questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page30>
　It's a great way to get to know the people in your area. ...... Kimono and apron.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　Then this girl is ----
<Page31>
"I'm sorry. Is it possible that you're a nanny here?
"------"
　The girl answered my question with only a smile.
<Page32>
"I'm sure you're tired, right?
　I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results. I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.
<Page33>
　The girl walked with a relaxed motion as if leading me.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page34>
　I believe there was a living room immediately after entering that hallway.
　I--
C:>I decided to follow them meekly.
C:>You can find a lot of people who are looking for a new way of life.
C:>...... I wanted to explore the mansion a bit.

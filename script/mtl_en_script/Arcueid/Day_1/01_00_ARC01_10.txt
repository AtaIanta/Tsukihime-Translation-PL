　---It's a great way to get to know the people in your area.

　No one woke me up.
　I didn't hear anything.
　Without any reason, vaguely.#　When was the last time I woke up in the middle of sleep?
<Page3>
　I felt that I had forgotten something, and I woke up restlessly.
<Page4>
　I felt my heart pounding, so I left the room, curious about what was going on outside.
<Page5>
　I was thirsty, so I went down the corridor in search of water.
<Page6>
　A long, moonlit hallway.
　The sounds of the night when the inhabitants had gone to bed.
　I ...... miss it.
　I'm sure I've walked these streets in the past.

　The inside of the drawer was rattled.
<Page11>
　It's a disappointment to find a few pebbles scattered around in a treasure chest you opened with high hopes.
　There were badges, accessories, binoculars, and other miscellaneous items collected by children lying around.
　Among them, there was one thing that was clearly out of the group.
<Page12>
　It is a dirty bandage stored in a transparent plastic case.
　It's neatly rolled up, but it's too old to be useful.
　There's nothing here.
　Close the drawer, I decided to return to the room.
<Page13>
　On my way out of the room.
　For no reason at all, I noticed that my cheeks were wet.
　Maybe.
　Maybe you've used this place before, when you were a kid.

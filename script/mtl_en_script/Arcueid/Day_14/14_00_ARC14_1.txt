"It's morning, Shiki-sama. Please wake up.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page2>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web.
<Page3>
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time with your family and friends. ...... It is hard to tell if the voice is urgent or calm.
<Page4>
"I'm sure you'll agree. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life. In the event that you've got a lot of money, you're going to need to be able to pay for it.
<Page5>
　...... No, I don't want you to make a horrible summary of the world .......
<Page6>
"I'm going to ...... get up. I'll be up in a minute.
　I replied with a blanket over my head and decided to wake up slowly.
<Page7>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama."
"''Ai, good morning.''
<Page8>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　The time is past seven in the morning.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page9>
"The breakfast is ready.
　Please come to the dining room as soon as you're dressed."
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page10>
"Ha ---- ah."
　I'm not sure what to do.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to use it for a lot of things.
<Page11>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　In the drawer, there is a dagger that has not been used since that night.
<Page12>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　But the wind blowing in is a little chilly.
<Page13>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　Fortunately, Akiha and the others didn't know that I had left my room, as my senpai had carried me there.
<Page14>
　One month has passed since that night.
　Tono Shiki's life is the same as before.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　In the event that the past is known, the relationship that has been cultivated over the years will not change.
<Page15>
　The school is not so big change, except that the corridor is under repair.
　There were no casualties in the collapse that occurred at midnight. Not a single person was injured, not a trace of blood was found at the scene, and everything had vanished without a trace.
<Page16>
　The only change is that the number of students has decreased by one.
　But the only person who remembers the "missing senior" is myself.
<Page17>
　The incidents of street robbery that used to cause a stir in the city have ceased.
　It's not as if the culprit has been caught, so the town remains lonely at night, but in another month it will regain its former vigor.
<Page18>
　I, after all.
　You will find a lot of people who are looking for a new way to live their lives.
<Page19>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with us. ......
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　Will I be able to endure these thoughts and end up somehow, or will I even get used to them and spend my days in a void?
<Page20>
　Human memory does not last forever. You can record events without forgetting them, but the glorious time ...... that existed there, her gestures and voice, will gradually be lost.
　This vivid memory will someday be sorted out as just a record of "what happened".
<Page21>
　But until then.
　Knowing that it was meaningless, I found myself keeping the remaining promise every day.
<Page22>
"....... I'm not sure if it's the end of autumn.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a great way to get a good night's sleep.
<Page23>
　Class is over.
　Even if no one is in the classroom.
　I won't return to the mansion until the sun goes down.
<Page24>
　The red classroom.
　Through the window, a fiery sunset is spreading.
　The bright red sun is melting as it sinks into the deep sky.
<Page25>
"-----"
　I've been waiting like this for a long time.
　As long as you remember the promise you made to her and you can't forget it, you will continue to wait here until this landscape disappears.
<Page26>
　There is only one promise that I could not fulfill.
"After all is said and done ...... and we've finished defeating the vampires.
　Why don't we play like this just one more time before we part ways?"
　I remember her nodding her head in wonder.
<Page27>
"So---I was just wondering what it would be like if we could meet for no reason, really, after we're no longer obligated to each other, that's all."
<Page28>
　...... In words, you say things like that.
　In my mind, I was only thinking about her.
　It's not a relationship where people cooperate with each other.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
　At that time, I thought she would be happy.
<Page29>
"Yeah---!
　When everything is over, let's come here again, Shiki!　It doesn't mean anything, but I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun ......!"
<Page30>
　After making her eyes widen in dismay, she nodded her head.
　In the sunset classroom.
　With a straightforward smile, she promised that.
<Page31>
　---I remember that promise.
　---I remember that smile.
　---Everything, I remember.
　I can't forget.
　I won't forget.
　I'll always remember when we promised to come back here in the burning classroom.
<Page32>
".................."
　It sinks deep.
　Hours until this vermilion color fades away.
　The quiet hours until the crimson air is gone.
　The world has stopped, which can feel like an eternity or a moment.
　Or perhaps I have long since lost my mind.
　I keep waiting for the person who is not supposed to come.
　As if to bite the time that was happy.
<Page33>
　---Katan.
　The sound of something touching the desk.
<Page34>
　I move my gaze.
　The window that was closed is open.
　If you notice.
　Tainted by the red sunlight, she was standing by the window.
<Page35>
　She does not move from the window.
　Even though she is in front of me like this.
　A gap that can never be reached.
<Page36>
"-------"
　I can't speak.
　But I'm feeling awfully calm.
<Page37>
"...... Oh my God. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
　I'm not sure what to do.#I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page38>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.#I'm sorry.
　I told you, I will never break my promise to you again.
"That's right. Thank you for keeping your promise.
<Page39>
　It's a mutual thing.
　Even if this is real.
　Even if this is real, even if it's just a crazy vision.
　I have to say thank you if it came true.
<Page40>
"But I'm sorry. This time, I'm the one who can't keep my promise.#
"...... Why?"
<Page41>
　...... I'm surprised at myself.
　In the event that you're in a position to do this, you'll be able to do so with the help of your own personal computer.
<Page42>
"I'm not sure what to say. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm sure you're not the only one.
　---That's what I'm talking about.
<Page43>
"...... is that Loa?
"Yeah. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not. The other True Ancestors believed that I was the only one who didn't have it.
　But my urges simply came too late.
<Page44>
"Until that time ...... when I became thirsty for blood, I was not even aware that I was a bloodsucker.
　So...#I don't even know if that's a bad thing.
<Page45>
　...... I see.
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.
<Page46>
"But that doesn't excuse it.
　One mistake and I've destroyed them all.
　I'm ...... never going to suck human blood again.
　But once a True Ancestor has sucked blood, he can no longer stay sane unless he sucks human blood."
"----"
<Page47>
The only reason I'm able to do this is because Shiki completely "killed" Roa.#"I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to take a look at your own personal life.
<Page48>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page49>
"That ---- is the thing.
"I'm not sure what to do. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　So ----
<Page50>
"It's not important.
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm sorry I broke my promise.
　...... I don't care about that.
　I just...#I just want you to be there for me.
<Page51>
"I can keep my ...... promise.
"Shiki ......?"
"Suck my blood. And then everything will be fine, right?
<Page52>
　Time is running out.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
"I'm very happy.
　I'm not sure what to do. I don't need Shiki's blood.
<Page53>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to do.
I'm not sure if there is any reason why you can't suck my blood.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page54>
"I don't suck because I love you.
　So, with a smile like a blooming flower, I said a heartfelt goodbye.#I'll be back.
<Page55>
"......................

　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page56>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　---- I wanted to stop him, even if it meant killing him.
　But the smile is just too gorgeous.
　I'm not sure what to do with it.
<Page57>
"I'm not sure what to say. Thank you so much for everything, Shiki.
".................."
　I'm not sure what to say.
<Page58>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　When I was a child.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page59>
"...... I'm a liar.
"I'm not sure what to say.　Shiki kept his promise to me.
"I'm a liar.
　I told you I would make you ...... happy.
　I swore I would.
<Page60>
"...... No, that's not true.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with them. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
"------"
<Page61>
"I'm sure you'll have a great time. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that. I'm not sure what to say.

I'm not sure what to do. I'm sure you'll be happy with the results.
　Just for a moment.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page64>
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
<Page65>
"....................."
　I clenched my teeth and held on desperately.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page66>
　---I'm not sure what to do.
"......... I see. You kept your promise, didn't you?
　In this classroom.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page67>
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time with your family and friends. ...... There are things you can lose, but this is the end of it.
　It's a great way to make sure that you're getting the most out of your time with your family and friends.
<Page68>
　If you think about it, there are always goodbyes.
　In the case of me and him, it was just a little too soon.
　This was a satisfying goodbye.#　He was still alive.#He smiled and told me he was happy.#He told me he was happy.#"Bullshit. ......!　It's not like that.#That's not what I...#　That's not what I wanted. .........!#No.
<Page69>
　---Yeah.
　I wanted more.
　I wanted to be with you more.
　I wanted to talk to you more.
　I wanted to feel his body heat more.
　More ---- more, I wanted to see that smile.
<Page70>
　Always.
　I've been trying to make ---- her happy for a lot longer than I am now.
　And yet, he is.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
<Page71>
"I'm a ...... idiot, I'm a ...... jerk."
　It was the last thing she wanted.
　The depths of ...... me are, in fact, the emptiness of the dead themselves.
　Knowing that I'm just a coward who is always pushing down his fears.
<Page72>
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page73>
　There's no way I can do that.
　I don't really have the confidence to live like that, not even a little bit.
　But even so, I want her to be able to dream happily.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page74>
"............ ah
　I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page75>
　The blue night sky.
　The moon shining white.
　---That's all that remains.
　But, very beautiful, memory.
<Page76>
"-------"
　And.
　It's a long, prayerful, big breath of air.
　But she's gone now.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page77>
"I'm not sure what to say. ...... I had a lot of fun, too."
　That was the last thing I remember about her.
<Page78>
　One day the moon will fade and the night will end.
　There is only a glassy moon in the night sky.
　A distant memory of the moon that seems to break if you touch it.
　I looked up at it forever...
　I looked up at it forever, until the dawn.

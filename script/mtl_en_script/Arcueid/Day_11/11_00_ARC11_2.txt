　In front of the site of the collapse accident.
　Six days have passed since the fire, and the area is quiet.
　The park in front of the station, which was once a place for people to relax, has now become a cruel ruin.
<Page2>
"...............
　There was once a life here.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page3>
　It's not a story you can get away with not knowing.
　It's a story you can get away with not knowing.
　After all, if you didn't have a hand in it, you can shelve all sins.
<Page4>
　If ignorance is a sin, then every human being is a sinner.
　If being untruthful is evil, then we are always evil.
　So there is no reason for me to bow to this spectacle.
<Page5>
　I don't regret the deaths of people I don't know.
　It's wrong to mourn the dead just because it's sad.
　A farewell is a remembrance of the living.
　It should be tears of gratitude for the person's accomplishments, remembering how brilliant he or she was.
　The tears you shed because you are sad and the apologies you make because you are sad are just rituals you perform for yourself.
<Page6>
　So I can turn my back on this landscape.
　I thought that I could do it.
<Page7>
I thought I would be able to. "------ Am I an idiot?"
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　There should be no sadness. There is no sense of justice.
　You will be able to find a lot more than just a few of them.
<Page8>
　And yet, there is something that makes me think that this is different.
　The curtain is not something you pull back when you've lost everything.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the best out of you.
　It's nothing.
　I felt that someone, no one, had shown me...
<Page9>
　The sound of footsteps from behind.
　There was...
　An unfamiliar face in our school uniform...
<Page10>
　Yeah. I can't even remember his name anymore, but he was standing there.
<Page11>
"Hello. Did you also come to offer flowers?"
"No, I..."
　The senior does not look away from the barricade.
　In the event that you're not sure what you're looking for, you'll be able to find out more about it here.
<Page12>
"You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier. ...... I just came to check myself.
　I've already got half an answer for that. After all, I am."
　You can't turn your back on vampires.
　You'll be able to't forget about the vampire named Roa.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page13>
"I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to do.
　You can get a lot more information on the web.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page14>
"'Going after Roa means going after her.
　Do you understand what that means?"
"I do. I can't do anything on my own anyway.
<Page15>
"...... You don't understand.
　Chasing her will only get you killed. You must never see Alcuade Brunstad again.
"...... Why is that?"
<Page16>
"Because once a true ancestor loses the urge to suck blood, it is too late.
　...... Even the true ancestors have the desire to suck blood.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　After all, the dead are just the ends of human beings. For us humans, the real monster is the true ancestor, the vampire of the beginning. In the event you're not sure what you're looking for, you'll be able to find it here.
<Page17>
"What ...... is the beginning?
<Page18>
"You can't say you haven't thought about it.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web. This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your money.
　This bloodsucking species that has a different phylogenetic tree as life is called the True Ancestor.
　They don't need human blood, and they have transcendent abilities equal to or even greater than those of the dead.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for, and what you can do to help.
<Page19>
"------"
　I was a bit rapt at that explanation.
　I'm not sure what to say. ...... I'm surprised.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what's going on in your life.
<Page20>
　...... At all.
　There is no such thing as a ridiculously cheerful, ridiculously reckless princess, not even in a storybook.
<Page21>
"...... Look.
　It's not just a matter of time before you find yourself in a situation like this.
　The true ancestors can survive without human blood.
　However, what kind of mistake happened in their birth, they have only one drawback ......, an unnecessary function.
　It is the blood-sucking urge, the preference for human blood.
<Page22>
"In the past, when the True Ancestors attacked, there was no one who could resist this. And the person whose blood was sucked would cease to be human at that point.
　It is said that the reason for this is the difference in the scale of life forms and that they regard blood as a soul.
<Page23>
"When the blood is taken by a powerful life form called the True Ancestor, a human being ceases to be a human being. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　...... hypothetically. Even if the blood-sucking ancestor does not want it.
<Page24>
"......... reminds me. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. On the other hand, does that mean that the True Ancestors will invade humans just by sucking their blood?
<Page25>
"Yes. And the problem is that there is no reason for their blood-sucking urge. Because there is no reason, there is no way to stop it.
　It is a flaw in the perfect life of a true ancestor.
　A mortal disease, if you will. They live by suppressing the urge to suck blood.
<Page26>
"It's not something that you can reason with them. They use all the power they have, both concrete and physical, to keep their own desires in check.
　They suppress their blood-sucking urges by using their powerful otherness on themselves. However, if the True Ancestor's ability is diminished due to some external factor, do you know what will happen to the bloodsucking urge that was suppressed?"
<Page27>
　If his own ability is reduced due to some external factor, ......?
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page28>
　Let's say ...... Alcade has 10 powers.
　Let's say that she has been using about 7 of them against her own inhibitions for a long time.
　But if she loses 5 of her 10 powers, she can't kill her own desires even if she uses all 5 of her remaining powers.
　Then, she'd have to make up the minus of that shortfall.
　What was she replenishing by cutting down on...?
<Page29>
"...... So. What happens to the true ancestors when they can no longer control their urges?
<Page30>
"Of course he sucks human blood. After that, there is nothing.
　Once he gives in to the urge, he will only fall.
　I have heard that once a true ancestor knows the taste of blood, the pain caused by the urge is doubled. As a result, he will never be able to resist the blood-sucking urge again."
<Page31>
"True Ancestors are an extremely superior species, but they can't give their all because they have to suppress their blood-sucking urges.
　But the fallen ancestors do not need to bind themselves anymore.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page32>
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it. ...... The figure of Alcade from last night comes to mind.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page33>
"I'm not sure what to make of that.
　It is an outright lie.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page34>
"Oh..."
　...... Yes, I'm afraid.
　This is a great way to make sure that you don't end up with a lot of problems.
<Page35>
"'...... The only thing that barely helps is that the urges are spontaneous.
　The True Ancestors only have one servant for when they can't take it anymore. That's the beginning of the things called the Dead Apostles.
　They are apostles who have already died. Vampires who were kept alive by the true ancestors as painkillers. That is the beginning of the vampires classified as the Dead that are nesting in this city.
<Page36>
"I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
　...... No, it just hasn't been necessary until now.
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not.
<Page37>
"The bloodsucking urge has no end, and it will never disappear.
　It's a very good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page38>
"The longer they live, the more the bloodsucking urge grows in them.
　The longer they live, the more the bloodsucking urge grows in them. And when they can no longer control it with their own strength...
　When their impulses exceed their own abilities, they end their lives at the hands of their own kind.
　That's what life is to them, without life."
<Page39>
"............"
　What the hell, that.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page40>
　It's not perfect at all.
No matter how powerful they are, there is always a fatal malfunction in their development...
<Page41>
"...... No. But that guy was fine.
　Yesterday, he was right back to normal. Now his powers are weakened because of me, but once his injuries are healed and he can use his powers freely, he will be able to...
<Page42>
"''That's impossible.
　Because she's at her limit to begin with.
"What?
<Page43>
"It is said that she was born in the twelfth century.
　No matter how much the actual activity time is less than a few years, her existence time itself is the same.
　The impulses that have lingered within her for so long will soon eat away at herself. In fact, it's probably better that she's been able to hold on until now.
　She, Alcade, is a life with no future.
<Page44>
　---Dokun.
　For the first time. It's not my anemia, it's someone else's words.
　I felt so dizzy that I lost my eyesight.
<Page45>
"-----"
　I mean, come on.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page46>
　---It's not right.
　It's just not right.
<Page47>
"......'s story doesn't make any sense.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one who's had it with the vampires.
<Page48>
"It's not for the humans that she deals with vampires. She does it because that's what she does.
"Her role... who decides what her role is?
<Page49>
"It's probably the other True Fathers.
　The twelfth century, when she was born, was the time of the most corrupt True Ancestors.
<Page50>
"The true ancestors couldn't leave the fallen true ancestors and the dead that they were creating behind.
　As a means to do so, they created pure True Ancestors who only needed to kill and nothing else, and made them their executioners.
<Page51>
"That's the True Ancestor called Alcade.
　It is said that she is like a missile, and once she was released from the castle, the vampires that were targeted were surely destroyed.
<Page52>
　---Dokun.
　I got dizzy again.
　Don't do it. ...... Please don't talk to me that way.
　I'm sure you've heard of it, but I'm not sure if you've heard of it. That's the kind of thing that makes me sick.
<Page53>
"No, she's a weapon. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what's wrong with her since she came to this town. ...... I've never seen her talk like that before.
　She never even spoke a word to begin with."
<Page54>
　What about -----?
　That's exactly what's ridiculous.
　What kind of a mouthful is that chatty, annoying guy who never spoke a word?
<Page55>
"I'm not sure what to make of that.
　That's the way she's always been, for hundreds of years now. Ever since she was born in that old castle in the mountains, she's been the same forever."
<Page56>
　---Dokun.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　...... I wonder what that means.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page57>
　The last paradise spread out among the mountains.
　The dawn wilderness reminiscent of the inland sea of stars.
　The courtyard of a castle that takes root in that realm.
　In a sea of blooming white flowers, the woman stands as if asleep.
<Page58>
"''She had no extra knowledge, no extra freedom.
　She is only let out when the target to be defeated is determined.
　She was taught the knowledge appropriate to the moment, so that she could execute the enemy with certainty."
<Page59>
　There is no one.
　There is no one to talk to.
　There is no one to meet face to face.
<Page60>
"When she returns from killing a predetermined vampire, her knowledge is washed away and she is put to sleep.
　She is imprisoned, knowing nothing, having no meaning other than to kill the vampire."
<Page61>
　Nothing.
　Not even the pleasure of making eye contact with someone.
　Or the fulfillment of a conversation with someone.
　"Her powers have been corrupted.
<Page62>
"Her power was so powerful that she could destroy even the fallen true ancestors.
　...... But it's ironic, isn't it? She was so powerful that she was shunned by the True Fathers.
<Page63>
"Although she was praised as a princess, no one dared to approach her.
　Although she was given a castle, her world was only a dimly lit basement. So there was no one to give her feelings.
<Page64>
"The True Fathers treated her as if they were tending a weapon. Weapons don't need any extra functions.
　It doesn't need a function to bake bread or wash clothes.
　If they were going to come with all that extra stuff, why not come with more weapon-like features?"
<Page65>
"--I've always been taught that I shouldn't do anything extra."
<Page66>
　So he said as he sang.
　This is the reason why you've got a vacant look in your eyes as you've been making decisions on your own until now.
　All along, that guy didn't need others, they didn't exist.
　Even if it's just that he didn't know it.
<Page67>
"The only thing the True Fathers wanted from her was a high killing power.
　Therefore, she knows nothing.
　Neither words nor feelings exist.
　She is a monster higher than the non-humans, the dead.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page68>
　...... You may be right.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page69>
　...... What a cruel misunderstanding.
　He was just...
<Page70>
"Because it's so much fun.
　I've never thought before that I'm just happy to be doing this, to be alive."
　Like it's an anxiety that I don't understand.
　She consulted in a subdued voice, the classroom at dusk.
<Page71>
"'Alcade has been active for a long time, but she knows less about the meaning of life than we do.
　She's only been allowed to act for a surprisingly short amount of time in terms of activity. Almost all of her life was spent sleeping. It was probably also a dark kind of sleep.
　If she doesn't even dream, there's no way humanity can arise there."
<Page72>
"Really?
　I enjoy just talking about it."
<Page73>
"...... So, after all the fallen true ancestors were executed, she never left the castle again.
　Since her purpose was done, I guess the True Ancestors tried to give her a decent education.
　However, she could not be free.
　Because by a really trivial mistake, she killed all the remaining True Ancestors in the castle."
<Page74>
　...... I see.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　One person remains, after all, the guy.
<Page75>
"''After executing the True Ancestors who were her kindred and parents, she shut herself up in the castle.
　The throne of the no longer empty castle of the true ancestors, chained by a thousand chains stretching from the castle walls.
　Every time a vampire named Roa is reincarnated, she wakes up from her sleep and is only active for a short while."
<Page76>
　In that predetermined world.
　He never uttered a single word, not a single word.
<Page77>
"'This is who Alcade Brunstad is.
　She is an executioner at heart.
　Even though the true ancestors who bound her are gone, she still roams around with the sole purpose of killing vampires.
　I suppose she has no other pleasure."
<Page78>
　That's a lie.
　It's not that he was happy about it.
<Page79>
　I did not see anything.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　If I'd have looked more closely, I would've seen it.
<Page80>
　I didn't realize how alone he'd been.
　I'm sure you'll be glad to know that I'm not the only one who's a bit of a jerk.
　At the end of the day, when you spend time in idleness, there is a kind of peace that you don't think is very important.
<Page81>

　...... Really, I had only found half the answer.
　You will never know what you should do.
　But now I finally realize what I want to do.
<Page84>
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.
　If I could make him feel like he could always have that, then how ----
<Page85>
"Hello?"
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　This is the reality of Tono Shiki.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page86>
"...... Did you hear what I said?
"I'm sorry, I don't remember.
　It sounded as if the older man was talking, and it sounded as if someone else was talking.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page87>
"Well, I mean, she's ----
"That's enough.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. I have to pay back double the responsibility for what I did."
<Page88>
　That's all I want to do now.
　You can't leave him alone any longer.
<Page89>
"...... I see.
　But is that really a responsibility you should be taking on?
<Page90>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page91>
　To protect the city, defeat the enemies of Alcade?
　That's a pretty thing. Restate it correctly like this.
"What you're trying to do is to kill some stranger for the sake of Alcade."
<Page92>
"Yes. But..."
　I raise my gaze.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
<Page93>
"Ah---"
　I'm dazzled and dizzy.
　The one I couldn't save, and
　The one that he protected with his own life.
　The place of our own happiness, which should be prioritized above all else.
"What a bastard."
<Page94>
"But... he's just as important to me, if not more so.
　If he's a vampire who doesn't care about humans, then I don't care about vampires, I care about killers."
"------"
<Page95>
　It's the wrong value system for a decent human being.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
<Page96>
"I'm so tired of this.
　I didn't think you were someone who could say so much and still be useless.
"I'm sorry. Stubbornness seems to be a trait of my sister.
<Page97>
"...... Your sister, huh? It's okay, though.
　I'm not sure what to say, but I'll give you a little advice. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. If she appears in front of you, it means that she came to suck your blood."
<Page98>
　The senior's line would be the truth for her.
　But it's a different truth for me.
<Page99>
"It's not true.
　Because he hasn't sucked blood yet."
"No, he hasn't. If Noelle hadn't stopped him, he would've sucked you dry.
<Page100>
"No. Because he stopped. He was fine, you know? So... it wouldn't have made a difference if someone hadn't interfered.
　Yes, indeed.
　You will find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page101>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　It's time to fly, so if you'll excuse me. The boss came and left me with a lot of noise.
<Page102>
　The older man walked past.
　The farewell to the person who did not make eye contact with me until the end, and did not mention his name, passed easily like this.
<Page103>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　Why did you only remember me?"
　I can't remember his name anymore.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page104>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　It's also the end of the line.
<Page105>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to take a look at the best way to use it.
　You can find a lot more than just a few.
　I thanked him and began to walk back to the place I was supposed to go.

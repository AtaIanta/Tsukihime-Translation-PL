　In a deep sleep.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page2>
　It seems that Alquaid is sneaking around by himself, setting up some sort of prank.
　What are you doing, I asked.
<Page3>
"I'm not sure.　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's not ...... that I'm awake, but rather I'm in a daze.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page4>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that, but it's kind of embarrassing.
　...... Alquade laughed like a girl.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family and friends. ...... I think it's funny that you can recognize her gestures with your eyes closed, but you can dismiss it as a trivial question because she looks so happy.
<Page5>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page6>
"I'm not sure what to say. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　...... He asks me a weird question.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page7>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm sure you've heard of it. So...
　What if that happened to me?"
　Don't do that.
　I've already told you that's not possible and I don't like to talk about what ifs.
<Page8>
"Yeah?　I like ifs.
　I don't know how it's going to turn out, but at least then I feel like I'll be saved.
　...... Ah.
　I remember you saying something like that before.
<Page9>
"I'm sure you'll agree. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　...... al...... quade......?
<Page10>
"I love you, Shiki.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
　...... So.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page11>
"I'm not sure what to say, but I'm going to go before Shiki wakes up.
　I'm not sure what to say, but I'm sure you'll understand. ...... I can't say goodbye to you face to face, so forgive me for this.
　...... The sound of the door clattering.
　I'm still asleep.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page12>
"-------"
　I'm not sure what to do.
　The sunshine coming in through the curtains is bright.
　It's a good idea to have a look at the clock to see if it's just past noon.
<Page13>
"Oh no, school ......!"
　I sit up.
　It's ...... a Saturday, come to think of it.
<Page14>
　It's a great way to make sure you don't have to go to school, and if you do have to worry about it, it's only because you didn't call home again and stayed in Alcade's room.
<Page15>
"-----"
　I'm sure you've heard of it.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one who has a problem with this.
<Page16>
"I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what's going on here.
　It may be a sign of happiness to have such a convenient dream while Alcade is still sleeping in the bed.
<Page17>
"You think so, don't you, Alk ----?"
　I look back at the bed.
　The voice died out there.
<Page18>
"---Al ...... Quade?"
　I looked at the bed in dismay.
　There's nothing on the bed.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　---I'm going to go with this.
　In a dream.
　She had said something like that.
<Page19>
"Wait a minute."
　I search around the room.
　There is no sign of Alcade as a matter of course.
<Page20>
　The only thing you can find is...
　The only thing I found was a piece of paper on the table.
<Page21>
"I'm sorry.
　I'm not sure what kind of joke ...... is being made, or where the language is coming from.
　The only thing written on the piece of paper was, "Bye, bye, bye.
<Page22>
"----what?"
　I don't want to believe it.
　But more than that, it is possible to understand what has happened to Alcade.
<Page23>
"---- Why, man?"
　It's ...... a joke.
　You can find a lot more than just a few of them.
　I promised you that I would be with you.
　I promised to stay with him, and I said I would help him to the end.
　Why ---- are you going back to being alone again, you... --
<Page24>
"Why, Alcade...!
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page25>
　After that.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page26>
　There is no way to ...... find Alcade.
　I know.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page27>
　---I'm not going to give up.
　I'm going to go crazy if I don't.
　I need to find him and yell at him for being an asshole, but I can't find Alcade.
　I'll never, ever find him again.
<Page28>
"-------, oh."
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time with your family and friends.
<Page29>
"-------
　I can't think of anything else before I go crazy.
　I'm not sure what to make of this. ...... You can hear the sound of cicadas in your ears.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page30>
　Is this what it means to lose your soul?
　Not even tears come to my eyes.
　My legs move as if they were empty.
　The animal's homing instinct.
　It's not like there's anything left, but I'm walking towards my bed.

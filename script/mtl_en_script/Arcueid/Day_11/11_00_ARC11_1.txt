　---It's morning.
　I put on the glasses under my pillow and open my eyes.
　The sky that I could see through the window was a calm blue sky.
<Page2>
"..................
　While the morning is impeccable, the feeling is dark and somber.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
<Page3>
"Let's forget about each other---"
　What is that talking about?
　Was it the violence in that alleyway?
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.
<Page4>
　...... Either way, it's impossible.
　I can't forget a single thing about him.
<Page5>
　I stare at my hands.
　These fingers still remember Alcade's body.
　I remember the feel of his skin sliding over mine.
　I can remember the warmth of his body, cold and hot.
<Page6>
　The regrets are too numerous to count. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page7>
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea. ...... But still, I thought selfishly.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page8>
"------."
　I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to say.
<Page9>
　I've been really attracted to that guy, without really putting into words why.
　I've been in love with him for a long time now, probably since the day he said he would forgive a bastard like me, never mind Lois. I've been turned on by him.
　But...
<Page10>
"It's better if we don't see each other anymore, isn't it?"
<Page11>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　...... It really is too late for everything.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page12>
　The morning scene is the same as usual.
　Jade came to wake me up.
　When I went to the living room, Akiba and Amber were there.
　We exchanged a quick greeting before heading off to school.
<Page13>
　Nothing is different from usual.
　I've put myself in danger to protect this time.
　So I should be happy. I have nothing to lose.
<Page14>
　And yet, my mood was inexplicably empty, and no matter who spoke to me, all I could do was give a blank answer, and I left the peaceful mansion automatically, like a machine performing a routine sentence.
<Page15>
　The students who pass through the main gate all look cheerful.
　All the students on their way to school are talking about tomorrow's holiday.
"I see. It's Friday, isn't it?
　In the past few days, I've been pushed around so much by him that my sense of the days of the week has faded.
<Page16>
　The first time I met him was on a Friday morning.
　He was waiting for me right here, at the intersection in front of the school.
"...... He was smiling, wasn't he?
<Page17>
　It's been that way since the beginning.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with your family and friends.
<Page18>
"'...... I wonder why. I'd like to at least ask him why."
　The opportunity to do so was lost, however.
　It is no longer possible for her to come to the park at night.
<Page19>
　I sit down in my seat.
　Homeroom is only about five minutes away.#I sit down in my seat.
　I was looking at the schoolyard in a daze, not doing anything.
<Page20>
"Oh, good morning.#I've been absent a lot lately, but have you finally gotten serious?
"............"
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page21>
"It's a good idea to take a look at your own personal life. You didn't show up for school yesterday, and when you did, it was because you were dumb. I'm not sure what to make of that.
　Arihiko shrugged his shoulders exaggeratedly.
<Page22>
"I'm sorry, but you're going to have to leave me alone today. I'm not sure what to say, but I'm sure you'll understand. No, in fact, you're luckier without me, aren't you?"
<Page23>
"What?　What do you mean "senior"? I don't know anyone in the third year.
"...... What are you talking about? Seniors are...#...
<Page24>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for a great deal more than just a great deal more.

"I'm not sure what to say.
I'll be back for lunch.

　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page26>
"I'm not sure what to say.　I'm not sure what to do.　Did you make a mistake?
"It's not a mistake. But, you know. The homeroom teacher of your class... This morning...#I heard that the homeroom teacher of your class quit school this morning.
　The math teacher, who is a laid-back person, said such a fact in a carefree voice.
<Page27>
"I'm not sure what to make of that.
"Is it possible for a teacher to quit so easily?
"You can't even last a week, there's no limit to your freedom."
"So she's a bitch, huh? That carnivore!"
　The men who were in favor of Noel's teacher screamed.
　I nodded my head vaguely, "I see.
<Page28>
　In a completely unrelated matter.
　It's not like it's a big deal.
　I accepted that it was all over now.
<Page29>
　The woman named Noel was assigned as a teacher to keep an eye on me, or rather to investigate the vampire Roa.
　The fact that she has disappeared means that she has no business being here anymore.
<Page30>
"I'm not sure what to make of this.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

"Hey. Good morning, Akiha."
　At any rate, I decided to greet Akiha first.
<Page2>
"You can find a lot more information on the web at .......
　I'm not sure what to make of this.　You look like you're about to collapse.
<Page3>
"Unfortunately, this is the face of the earth. Don't expect me to greet you with high spirits in the morning.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't get caught in the middle of the night.
<Page4>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　If you want breakfast, we can serve it in the dining room, so please call us anytime.

"No, nothing. Even if it's ......, what are you doing up so early?　To be late?
<Page10>
"You know what? You will find a lot of things that you can do to make sure that you are always on time.
　Your brother's school is about a 30 minute walk from here, right?　It's not that far away, so please don't be late. It's embarrassing.
<Page11>
　Well, it's prickly and prickly.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.

"I'm sure you'll agree. This is a great way to make sure that you don't have to worry about your own health.
　I'm sure you'll agree.

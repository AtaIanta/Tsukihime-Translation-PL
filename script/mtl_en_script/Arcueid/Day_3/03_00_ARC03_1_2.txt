"Good morning, Amber. It's a beautiful day this morning, isn't it?
"Yes, good morning, Mr. Shiki.
<Page2>
　He returned the common greeting with a big smile.
<Page3>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
<Page4>
"It was all right, I was only uncomfortable with the height of the ceiling, but everything else was fine. I used to live here, and now I have Amber to take care of me.
"I'm not sure what to say. You are very good at this, Shiki.
"No, no, no. It's true.
<Page5>
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　It's not that I'm a good communicator.
　It's not that I'm a good communicator, it's the power of Amber's smile.
　---And.
<Page6>
　I noticed another gaze silently staring at me from earlier.
"I'm sorry.
Hi."
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page7>
"I'm not sure I'm used to hearing that, brother.
　I'm not sure if there's anything more to it after that.
"I'm not sure what to say. There is no continuation at all.
　You can find a lot more information on the web. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page8>
"I'm not sure what to say. It's a great day this morning, huh?
<Page9>
"You don't have to force me to greet you.
　You can ignore me if you want. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　Oh. If you like each other so much, would you like to become Amber's servant?　I wouldn't mind that at all."
<Page10>
"...... You've been on full throttle since this morning, haven't you?"
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page11>
"This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page12>
"The reason you haven't finished your breakfast is because your brother wakes up late. It's his own fault that his mornings are so rushed.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.
<Page13>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to make of it.
"Yes, I have everything ready. I'm always ready when you are.
<Page14>
"No, Amber. It's already this time of day, and your brother doesn't have time to eat breakfast. He'll be late for school.
<Page15>
"No, no, no. It's only just after seven, so there's plenty of time for that.
　It's only a 30-minute walk from here to our high school.
"So you only have ten minutes for breakfast? You're not a hungry dog, so please take your time with breakfast.
<Page16>
"Mm, g--"
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family. I'm not going to say what.
<Page17>
"...... brother.
　Did I just say something suspicious?"
"No, nothing. Nothing, really.
　I'm not a dog, Akiba..."
<Page18>
　I just remembered.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to try to find out.

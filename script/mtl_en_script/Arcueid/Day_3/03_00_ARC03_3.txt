　Before HR.
　The classroom was more lively than ever.
<Page2>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　Fortunately, I don't belong to either camp. So, I walked across the classroom and walked to my seat without any concern. ......
<Page3>
"I'm sorry. You're late, Tono."
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time in the office.
　In addition.
<Page4>
"Good morning, Tono-kun.
　Together with an unexpected person.
<Page5>
"Senpai?　Why are you in our classroom?
<Page6>
"Is that so unusual?　I just dropped by to see if Tono-kun was in class.
"It's rare. Usually, upperclassmen don't come to the lowerclassmen's class. It's embarrassing to be in an underclassman's class because you feel like a foreigner.
<Page7>
"Is that so?　I'm not sure what to make of it. But I'm fine with it. We're all from the same school."
　What kind of philanthropy is that?
<Page8>
"I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.
　I see, the senior nodded earnestly.
<Page9>
"I'm not sure what to do. It's a great way to get to know your friends and family. You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
"............
　He was too tough, both mentally and physically.
<Page10>
"It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a good thing you're here because you're going to love it.
<Page11>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what's going on in your life.
<Page12>
"I'm not sure what to make of it. In the event that you're not sure what you're looking for, you'll be able to find out more about it here.
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page13>
"You can find a lot more than just a few of these in the marketplace.
"This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family and friends. You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page14>
"...... Is that so?　Tono-kun, you don't seem to be very angry.
<Page15>
"You can find a lot more information on the web at: ...... No, this is not true. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money. I'm not sure what to say. It's a good idea.
"......Huh. Crack?
<Page16>
"......Yes, yes. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.

　If the play is so blatantly played out, I feel depressed before I get angry.
<Page19>
　In the meantime, the senior is hiding his or her mouth with his or her hand, wondering how serious he or she really is.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page20>
"It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time with us.
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.　I'm not sure what to make of it.　Can you introduce me to her next time?
"Arihiko. So you're trying to fight me, huh?
<Page21>
"Of course not! Tono and I are great friends!　If you don't like it, you can beat up your parents, but you don't fight with your best friend, that's what I believe. I'm basically a man who lives for chivalry."
<Page22>
　That's great.
　Chivalry means it's okay to raise your hand against your parents, in his inner world.
<Page23>
"I see. That's a rotten policy you've got there.
"What, pretending to be down in the dumps, you're just the same old Tono!　I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a good idea to have a good friend who can help you out.

"So, how's the new house?
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.#"Well, I don't know. Anyway, I had a weird dream last night and the people at home gave me the evil eye.
"Hmm. So, that's a disaster.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page26>
"....................."
　---I'm not sure what to say.
　In the event that you think that you are silent, the senior was seriously looking at me and Arihiko having a trivial conversation.
<Page27>
"Senpai?"
"Tono-kun, you and Inui-kun are close after all, aren't you?
"'Are you serious, senpai? You can't think that by looking at it now, your glasses aren't properly adjusted.
<Page28>
"That's not true. I'm not sure what to make of it. It's just a matter of time.
　I'm not sure why, but he smiled happily.
"What is it?
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page29>
"I'm jealous. I admire the fact that you have a friend who can understand you without any hesitation like that.
　I'm impressed with you.
"I'm not sure if that's true or not.
　He and Arihiko face each other and furrow their brows.
<Page30>
"I'm not sure what to say. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
"I'm not sure what to do with it. I haven't seen it yet.
<Page31>
"I see. Then I'll ask you frankly, in this morning's news, there was a big house on the screen. Is that Tono-kun's house?
"What?"
<Page32>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page33>
"I'm sure it's the house.

<Page35>
"I'm not sure what to say.
"I'm not sure what to say. If it's boring, I won't ask.
"It's not boring. The big question is, when did you become so close that your senior came to see you?
<Page36>
"I can't answer that question. You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　I mean, you seemed so friendly to me.
"Not really. It took me seven days to remember your name.
<Page37>
"Wow. That's unusual. Wasn't it your policy not to deal with women who don't fall for you in a day because they're a pain in the ass?
<Page38>
"It's a good idea. I'm not sure what to do.
　I've been keeping it a secret, but the truth is, I prefer...
"I'm sure you'll agree.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page39>
"I'm sure you'll understand, best friend.
"I know. I'm not sure what to make of this. You can read whether you are serious or not.
　The senior is really cute. You can't talk to her and not like her. I don't either."
<Page40>
"I see, I see.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
What do you mean?
"I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one. It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web.
<Page41>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
"It's a short friendship, Tono.
"Yeah, exactly.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your day.

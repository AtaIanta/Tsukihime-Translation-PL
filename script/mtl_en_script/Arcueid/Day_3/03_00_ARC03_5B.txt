　I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　It is past two o'clock in the afternoon.
　The bustle of the city does not diminish.
　A lot of people pass by.
　I don't know their names or identities, but they are going to their own destination without looking at someone else who is walking right next to them.
<Page2>
　Even though there are so many people in the same place, they all have only one view.
　Just as I am my own leading man.
　They are having a day in which they are the main actors.
<Page3>
　Every day they see, but they see nothing.
　Each day doesn't intersect, doesn't branch out anew.
<Page4>
　The wisdom to get the least amount of peace with the least amount of effort.
　Necessary but uninvolved individualism seems to be the path chosen by humans.
<Page5>
"..............."
　Maybe it's the low fever, but I'm getting sentimental.
"...... Let's go home.
　I'm feeling calmer now, and staying here will only get me lost in bad thoughts.
<Page6>
　You will find a lot of things to do to make your life easier.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website of the company.
　Right now, I just wanted to be an organ that breathes, meditating with my glasses off in a room that no one visits.
@g --- until I crossed paths with that woman.
<Page7>
"------"
@g I even thought that time had stopped.
@g Everything in me remembers that moment like it was sucked in.
<Page8>
@g ---Dokun.
@g Gold hair and red eyes.
@g White clothes. @g White shadows.
@g A snowfield with no footprints.
@g An unblemished silhouette reminiscent of a sacred mountain beyond human comprehension.
<Page9>
@g ---Dokun.
@g The pulse leaps up.
@g The rotation swings out.
@g Veins and arteries activate.
@g The nerves dissipate one after another, the spinal cord heats up in a hallucination.
<Page10>
@g If you say you were admiring it, you were definitely enthralled.
@g My feet have already stopped.
@g I look back to make sure I don't lose sight of the woman's shadow, which has passed from my sight.
<Page11>
"@g -, ---------"
@g I find myself forgetting to breathe.
@g I feel nauseous.
@g I can't breathe.
@g I can't breathe.
@g I can't for the life of me remember how to breathe properly.
<Page12>
"-- -@g, ---------"
@g My throat is burning.
@g My eyeballs feel like they're going to shatter.
@g My palms are slick and wet.
@g There's not enough blood, and my fingers are so cold I can't feel them.
@g I'm sweating so much.
<Page13>
@g The ecology reminds me that I am an animal.
@g Breathing has restarted on its own.
@g But reason.
<Page14>
　　　I didn't make any mistakes.
　　　I didn't choose anything.
　　　I just wanted to go home.
<Page15>
@g Reason.
@g Vaguely, I realized that the tightrope I had been tricking myself into walking has now been cut.
<Page16>
"'Hah ---- hah ----- hah. ----"
@g I have to ...... chase her.
@g I have to chase that woman.
@g Chase, chase, chase, let's talk.
@g Move your frozen feet, move your frozen feet.
@g Breathe hot like a ■■■.
@g Seek the sight of white prey.
<Page17>
"'Haa ---- haa ---- haa ----"
@g The woman is walking slowly.
@g She's not interested in me at all.
@g --- A faint question flashed through my mind.
@g Not interested?　That's absurd. He's such an idiot. But the fact is, I'm not even aware of it. After something. After something. Maybe he's just really tired. Exhausted. Exhausted. That's why there's an opportunity. The reason I feel this way is because I'm convinced that I can do it.
<Page18>
@g@bI want to lick it around like it's laughing.
@g How old was the last time you satisfied your desire?
@g@bI want to tear it apart as I seek it.
@g Not at the cost of masturbation or intercourse, but in a simpler, more primal way.
@g@bI want to tear it down as I taste it.
@g I don't remember. In the first place, I'm still...
@g@bI'm still dying to follow my heart.
I don't remember that "first time".
<Page19>
@g hah," he said, letting out an emotion he couldn't believe was his own.
@g I clench my chest to hold back my boiling emotions.
I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page20>
"-------"
@g My throat is aching.
I'm not sure what to make of it.
@g What's wrong with that? That's a given.
@g It would be rude for a living creature not to get excited after seeing so much of it.
<Page21>
@g I take things out of my bag.
@g I put it in my pocket and walk.
@g I feel the touch of iron on my fingertips.
@g How lucky.
@g The tools are just in place.
<Page22>
@g Wonderful. I'm about to cum. @g What a sensual meeting.
@g Keep a good distance.
@g Unnoticed.
Don't let anyone around you get in the way.
@g Me and that woman are strangers.
@g So I have to follow the scent as naturally as possible.
<Page23>
@g The woman is going into the apartment.
@g The glass automatic door. Security is perfect.
@g You can't even enter the hall unless you're a resident.
@g I'll go around to the emergency exit. She takes off her jacket and puts it in the shadows. Turn it off. I go inside.
<Page24>
@g There's no one in the hall.
@g Look at the elevator. The ramp is stopped at the top floor.
<Page25>
"------"
@g Press the call button. I go inside.
<Page26>
@g Immediately, I was horrified by the presence of so much.
@g The residue of a woman's scent makes my mouth water.
<Page27>
@g I'm excited.
@g In the tightly closed room, I clutched the object in my pocket.
@g There's that woman right beside me.
@g I can do it in just a few more seconds.
<Page28>
@g I'm getting out of the elevator.
@g I had guessed that there was no one in the hall.
@g Get out of the secret room. Heading down the hallway. No sign of anyone.
@g No idea.
@g There's only one word my brain can produce.
<Page29>
@g the woman.
@g The woman.
@g I'm going to keep going -----
<Page30>
@g I'm in front of room three.
@g This must be it. All the other rooms are empty. Can you be sure?　I can. That level of sense of smell, if you're alive as an animal, you're bound to have it. It's just a matter of lazy survival and forgetting. It's disgraceful. It's unforgivable. There is nothing we can do about it. The rules of civilized society are very gentle and unharmful, which is why such a trivial impulse can become a fatal wound.
<Page31>
"---, ------"
@g I tried to press the doorbell, but stopped.
@g My glasses are in the way.
@g You can't even do what you can with these things on.
<Page32>
@g
　You can't look at things with a careless mind.
<Page33>
"........."
@g There was a woman who said that to me a long time ago.
@g I can't remember her name or face now.
<Page34>
@g I slowly took off my glasses.
@g The swirling lines look like aging wrinkles.
<Page35>
@g I don't know what I'm doing.
@g What am I trying to do?
@g Why am I doing this?
@g What does Tono Shiki want to do with the woman from earlier?
<Page36>
@g Wakaranai.
@g I don't know, Mom, press the chime.
<Page37>
"Yes..."
@g A voice through the door. The door opens.
@g moment.
@g I slipped into the room through that small gap.
<Page38>
"E----"
@g A woman's voice rises.
@g I tried to get up.
@g I will never hear the voice of a woman who has been so obsessed with me, so desperate for me, forever.
@g Before that, the whole thing was complete.
<Page39>
@g The moment I entered the room, I heard a click and the sound of a hammer falling.
@g The sound of the door. The creaking in my brain. The alarm bell of the end.
@g None of these are the same. Then what is it?
@g I don't need to tell you. There's only one process.
@g It's nothing but the climax of unleashing the knife.
<Page40>
@g Instantly, the 'line' that ran through the woman's body was passed through.
@g Stabbing.
@g cut, and
@g through, @g
@g running, and
@g cut it roughly into chunks.
@g murdered to perfection.
<Page41>
@g A total of 17 lines on the body, @g
@g the neck, the back of the head, from the right eye to the lip, the upper right arm, the lower right arm, the ring finger of the right hand, the elbow of the left arm, the thumb and middle finger of the left hand, the left breast, from the ribs to the heart, from the stomach to the abdomen in the same two places, the left groin, the left thigh, the left shin, the left toe, all of them.
@g In the blink of an eye, without taking even a second.
The truth is, in the blink of an eye, all of it.
I dismantled it into 17 pieces of meat.
<Page42>
"What...?
　I heard a stupidly dumb voice.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page43>
　It's a good idea to have a good time.
　There was something scattered in pieces in front of me.
　On the marble floor, a red liquid spreads out like a bucket of water turned upside down.
　The smell of blood is revolting.
　The cut surface is very clean, no guts have spilled.
<Page44>
　Only the red color erodes the floor like a wave.
　It's a strange story.
　There is nothing in the room but the dismembered limbs of the woman and herself standing there.
<Page45>
"What...?
　The red erosion is too vivid.
　In my own hand, I hold the knife of the murder weapon.
<Page46>
It's dead.
　It's natural.
　It's not human if it's still alive.
<Page47>
What?
　Nothing, nothing at all.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page48>
I'm not sure what to do.
　So definitely.
　Or is it different?
　I don't have a reason. So no, it can't be. But there never was a reason. That's why it's different. I'm the only one here. There was another person here a while ago, but now I'm the only one alive. That's why it's different. It must be different. But there's no reason, there's no reason, I didn't want to, I wasn't, I wasn't in my right mind. I was never sane in the first place. So no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
<Page49>
　---Red blood spreads on the marble floor.
　It's soaked.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page50>

<Page52>
"It's not me.
　You're wrong.
　No. It's not. I'm sure it's not, it's definitely not.
　This must be...
C:>It must be some kind of bad yume.
C:>...... No, it's a reality I've caused.

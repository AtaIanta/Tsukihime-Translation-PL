　It's a great way to get to know the people in your area.
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
<Page2>
"I'm not talking about the dead ones from earlier, but the more dangerous ones. ......
　The Twenty-Seventh Patriarch, right?　Vroob said he was one of them, but what are they?
<Page3>
"Oh, you're going to ask that?
　I'm gonna hear that.
<Page4>
"I'm not sure what to do.
I know, I know. After we beat Vroob, he's gonna bite!
"I know, I know.
<Page5>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page6>
"I'm not sure what to make of it. You can think of them as kings.
　But in order to talk about the ancestors, you need to have a bit more prior knowledge. ......"
<Page7>
"Ta-da!
　I'm sure you'll agree with me.
<Page8>
　The whiteboard appears with a squeak.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page9>
"I'm not sure what to say.　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page10>
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can contact us at the web site.
　Alcade needs to be more serious.
<Page11>
"I'm not sure what to make of that.
　This is the ladder that represents this."
<Page12>
"I won't go into the details, but
　I'm not going to go into detail, but up to the third rung, you're a living corpse.
　In the fourth and fifth ranks, you are a "night genus" living in the night.
　Finally, at the sixth level, you become a vampire who can form a community.
<Page13>
"I'm not sure what to make of that.
　You can make a child through bloodsucking and erosion and become the apex ...... parent of the group you have created.
　But you can't have more than the VI rung. If you're a normal vampire, that's where your rise stops.
<Page14>
".................."
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page15>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　But ......
<Page16>
"There are those who have created them. ...... No, you mean there are vampires who are above the dead.
"I'm not sure what you mean. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
<Page17>
"The VIIth rung is the advanced mortals.
　I'm not sure what to make of it. It's the same name, but its scale is different from the VI rung.
<Page18>
"I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　It is a heresy that no ordinary agent can compete with.
　A vampire of noble birth, allowed to make his own will.
"......?　What do you mean, "will"?
<Page19>
"It means they're not slaves.
　A superior mortal is not subject to absolute obedience to his master, the Founder. They can defy him.
<Page20>
"Whenever they have the chance, the advanced mortals can defeat their ancestors and inherit their curse.
　But it's almost impossible to defeat the ancestor. It's a good thing that you're not the only one. It is difficult for an advanced mortal to surpass the scale of the ancestor's existence."
<Page21>
"So, if I were to inherit the Ancestor, it would be the VIII rung. The successor.
　The talented vampires that the ancestors recognized as their successors.
　So to speak, princes and princesses.
　You can find a lot of people who are not vampires.
<Page22>
"Princesses." ......#I mean, like you?
　You said you were royalty, right, Alcade?
<Page23>
"Hmm, maybe there are some mortals out there who were created with similar traits to me.
<Page24>
"VIII Ladder, if there are at least two for each ancestor, there are more than 50 of them. Some of the ancestors may have tried to do so.
　However, since they are fundamentally different from me, they will always be imitations.
<Page25>
"In the event that you have any questions regarding where by and how to use it, please do not hesitate to contact us.
　I'm sure you're right. I'm sure they're better than Vrove when it comes to basic reserves alone.
"------"
　Better than that vampire ......?
　A monster like that is over 50 ......?
<Page26>
"See, I knew it.
　Your blood is boiling, killer.
"No, I'm not. That's called being scared, vampire.
<Page27>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page28>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page29>
"That's right. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　The crimson stain that fell from the moon to the earth.
　The deadly poisons that have a world that is never incompatible with the others.
　The long-lived who created the VI ranks of the dead and ingested you humans as their "lifespan.
<Page30>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what you're talking about.
　I'm sure you'll agree.
<Page31>
"In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page32>
　In the scale of vampires, Vrouve is a mortal who has only recently become an ancestor.
　This is the reason why he appeared in the city and committed such a heinous act without respect to tradition and style, Alcade explained.
<Page33>
　That's all right. The rules of the vampires have nothing to do with me.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It is a curse that paints the world as extremely cold just by existing.
　The flames scattered only to endure that cold.
　This is no longer something that a 'thing in the shape of a person' is allowed to have.
<Page34>
"...... I don't understand.
　No matter how long you live, the dead are just an extension of you. No matter how long a person lives, they can't do that kind of trick.
　Isn't there something else to being an ancestor?
<Page35>
"Yes. To tell the truth, it doesn't matter how many years you have lived to become the founder.
　It is the quality of the blood that makes an ancestor an ancestor.
<Page36>
"The commandments of the Great Origin are engraved in the soul.
　The truths that each of us has received, the worldview that underlies our thirst.
　A singularity that rewrites the physical laws of the planet just by letting its blood circulate.
　Idea Blood Precept.
<Page37>
"Principle Blood Commandment."
　It is.
　You mean that bottomless pit in the middle of his innermost recesses?
<Page38>
"Well, let's just say it's a crown.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　However, it takes a foundation of a thousand years to move the Principle Blood Precept. Even if a mortal who has been active for a few hundred years inherits it, he will be crushed by the curse."
"''Like Vroob?
<Page39>
"I'm sure you've heard of it, but I've never heard of it. ......
　It's a great way to get the most out of your time and money. ......
<Page40>
"I'm not sure if I'd be able to do that if I were you.
　I'm not sure what the problem is, but I'm sure it's not the only one.
　I don't ...... like to think about it too much. Is this going to piss off the other Founders?"
<Page41>
"''Oh, it's fine. I'm not sure what to do.
　The twenty-seventh ancestors are basically enemies, so who cares if Vroob disappears in this island country?
<Page42>
"So there will be no reprisals from them?
"No. Only some of them are cooperating.
　As long as you don't mess with the old 5 ...... gods alliance.
　However, not all of them are enemies of humans, and some of them have already been defeated.
<Page43>
"I'm not going to change my mind because the 'twenty-seventh ancestor' is a name that indicates a way of being, but in reality, it's, uh, ...... the remaining twenty-one ancestors?
　The principle of Affenbaum, which the Vroobs inherited.
　The principle of "fruitfulness", the principle of "the castle, the kingdom".#The principle of the sword.
　The principle of the sword.
　And the principle of melting, sealed in the church.
　"sealed in the Church, the principle of the Limb. ......
<Page44>
"This is all that has been reduced in nearly three thousand years.
　The Church has been preparing and executing to seal a single founder for a hundred years, and has only succeeded twice.
　How's that?　I'm sure you'll be able to understand how great it was to kill Vrove this time."
<Page45>
"...... Well, it was mostly thanks to you, though.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
"That's a relief. There are no more twenty-seven ancestors in this country."
<Page46>
　That's good to know.

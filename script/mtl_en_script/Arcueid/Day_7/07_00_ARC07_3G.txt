　When you are released from the handshake ...... with Alcade, which can be said to be just a one-sided grab,......, the time was approaching nine o'clock in the evening.
<Page2>
　In the event that you've got a lot of time to think about it, you'll be able to do it.
　This is where the vampire extermination starts all over again.
<Page3>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　Do you still want to walk the streets and look for the dead?
<Page4>
"That's right. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　That's the only thing we can do for now, but ......"
　Is that still okay?　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page5>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page6>
　With .......
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
<Page7>
"I'm not sure what to say. Did I say something funny?
"I'm sure you'll agree. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
"..................
　...... Let's be more violent from now on.
　I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what you need to do.
<Page8>
"Let's go. You can go around the city, right? Do you want to go back and check under the elevated train tracks?
<Page9>
"No, I'm done with that area.
　The dead don't feed on each other, they have their own routes of operation so that the number of victims is not concentrated in one section.
　There's a limit to how many people can be fed in a night. I think we're done here tonight,......, but now that Shiki is here, let's explore some more.
<Page10>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what's going on in your life. I thought it would be more indiscriminate.
<Page11>
"In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site. Routine work is good for them.
<Page12>
"It's a valuable piece of labor. I'm sure you'll be able to figure out how to do it.
　Since the number of Alcade is decreasing, you can increase the number of people from here on out, or you can withdraw the dead and hide them. ......
<Page13>
"I'm not sure what to make of that.
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　In the event that you're not sure what you're looking for, you'll be able to find it on the web.
<Page14>
　...... I see.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page15>
　It is difficult to find a parent who is asleep somewhere in this city.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　Parents who have been cut off from the source of labor and sustenance they need to survive will eventually be forced to act on their own.
<Page16>
　It's a good idea to have a vampire in your life.
　This is where ...... vampire extermination comes into play.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page17>
"I understand the situation. Anyway, we should walk around the city at night and find the dead who are still active, right?
<Page18>
"Yes. So, Shiki. I want you to take off your glasses and follow me, okay?
"Take off your glasses. Why ......?
<Page19>
"Because it's more reliable.
　I can sense the presence of both humans and non-humans.
　You can read the difference between the living and the dead in visual information.
　There are more ways to find someone than there are ways to find them, right?
<Page20>
"-----"
　...... Arquaid's explanation makes sense.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　But to take off the glasses and act...
<Page21>
"I'm sure it's going to put a lot of strain on your body.
　But since it's a good opportunity, I just want to check one more time.
　If you decide that you are okay with Shiki, take off your glasses and follow me."
<Page22>
　...... walking around town with your glasses off, huh?
　It's a good idea to take a look at your own personal life and the way you live it.
<Page23>
　You can easily imagine what it would be like to walk around the city in that state when you have a headache from just looking at things in the first place.
　Still...
<Page24>
"............
　...... It's okay, it's only a headache.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family.
<Page25>
"It's a good idea to take off your glasses and go with it.
　It's a great way to get rid of a problem.
<Page26>
"I'm not sure what to say. Then let's go.
　It's a good idea to take a deep breath, take off your glasses and start walking towards the city.
<Page27>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　This is the first time since I was in the hospital that I've walked through a landscape full of postcards like this.
<Page28>
"----"
　I'm not dizzy at the moment.
　If you just look at it, you won't get a headache.
　It's not just the thin lines on the buildings, but the "lines" of people walking down the street that make me sick.
<Page29>
　...... I can't help but feel disgusted first.
It's not the "people with graffiti all over their bodies" that are creepy.
　It's just that it's nauseating to be informed that human beings are such easy creatures to die.
<Page30>
　Walk through the city at night.
　Arquaid did not say anything, but as if there was a destination, he proceeded on foot without hesitation.
<Page31>
　We spent about two hours going around the main places in front of the station.
　In the end, I could not find a single person who had an abnormal line in their body.
<Page32>
"You can put on your glasses, Shiki.
　After all, it seems that there are no more dead tonight.
<Page33>
　Put on your glasses.#.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page34>
"You can't just give up so easily.　I've only been around the city once.
<Page35>
"No, one look around is enough. ─ No, one look around is enough, a sign remains in a place for a while. But there was no sign of the dead anywhere in the city.
　Maybe that was the last of the dead to get food. From here, we'll go on to crush the dead one step higher."
<Page36>
"'...... You look grumpy, Alcade.
"It's not surprising. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. I'm not sure what to say. I was just trying to show off my good looks.
<Page37>
"------.
　.......
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page38>
"In the event that you're in the market for a new pair of shoes or boots, then you're in the right place.
　I'm not sure what to make of it. Maybe you'll find something.
<Page39>
"No, no, no. I can't make you do anything more than you're doing tonight.
"No?　What do you mean, I can't? I'm not ......
<Page40>
"You're doing it. It's just that Shiki doesn't realize it. It's a good idea to have a good time. Here, sit on the bench. You'll be able to get some relief from this, right?
<Page41>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at our own web site.
<Page42>
"I'm sure you'll agree. ......
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page43>
"I'm sure you'll be glad you did. ...... Thanks for the help.
　But this is about as mild as it gets compared to the headaches I've had. It's nothing dangerous compared to the dizziness that can keep you awake,......."
<Page44>
　In the event that you have any kind of questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　It's not a problem compared to Alcade's wounds.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.#Alcuade?
<Page45>
"Don't overdo it, you weak creature.
　If she doesn't faint, it's minor?　You're wrong. There's nothing light or heavy about your eyes.
　Don't try to see what you can't see. You'll cripple your brain if you work it too hard.
"......?　Who's a cripple?
<Page46>
"You!　How can you be so insecure?
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.　I'm not sure how you've managed to stay alive all this time, but you can snatch it up and eat it, normally!
<Page47>
　...... What is normal in any country?
　I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one. It's a great way to keep the peace, and it's a great way to keep the peace.
<Page48>
"...... I get it. I didn't want to say too much, but I'll explain it to you.
<Page49>
"Okay?　You said that it is easy to see the death of living things, but difficult to see the death of minerals.
　It's a matter of your brain's circuitry, after all.
　The death of things. The fact that you can see the cause and effect of the deaths is actually more like you are reading them, not seeing them.
<Page50>
"All events have a primary cause, an absolute one.
　It is the beginning and the end of the universe.
　There is a "thing that records everything" there. It cannot be called information because it is something that "exists" rather than a record. It just "is". It has no will of its own, and it has no direction. It's just a whirlpool of causes, a whirlpool of roots.
<Page51>
"I'm not sure what to do with it, but I think it's a good idea. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's not that I'm not a fan of the idea, but I'm not a fan of the idea.
<Page52>
"But you know, no matter how far we are from the source, as long as we are derived from it, there is a thread, a very thin thread, that connects us.
<Page53>
"It's a record of the source of everything, the beginning and the end of everything.
　If you are connected to it, you are "aware" of the end of things.
　The brain of higher animals is a function of reception and transmission, but most of us have closed the line only to ourselves. But there are some people whose lines are potentially open. People who don't use any magic circuits and aren't even a transcendent species, but are capable of supernatural phenomena.
<Page54>
"This is what the sorcerers classify as psychics.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　---For example, a person who can see the death of things without having learned any mysteries.
<Page55>
"------
　...... I'm sorry, Alcade.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page56>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site. In addition to the line, you can also see the point that is the base point of the line.
"------"
<Page57>
　I'm sure you're right. ......
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website and see if there is anything you can do to help. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page58>
　In retrospect, it's not just with Vrove.
　Most of the time, I would lose consciousness from the phantom pain that would slice through my brain stem, but the dots were there.
<Page59>
"...... Yes.#I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea. There were several of them, and the lines were flowing as if connecting the dots.
<Page60>
　If you want to use a metaphor, it's like a blood vessel.
　If a line is a blood vessel, then a point is something that produces that blood vessel.
<Page61>
"A line that is easy to the death of a thing" and "its death" ......, isn't it?
　I think ...... Shiki can even see the death of minerals if he wants to. In the event that you have any questions regarding where and the best way to get in touch with us, please do not hesitate to contact us.
　That's an impossible exercise. The brain is overloaded and Shiki will definitely be useless.
<Page62>
　...... become useless, huh?
"Does that mean my eyes won't see death anymore?
<Page63>
"I'm not sure. Hey, Shiki, what happens to an engine that's been recklessly overblown?
"It'll go to junk. Once an engine is seized, it can never be used again. ----
<Page64>
　Yeah, that's it.
　So the headache of watching death is the same as an engine that screams because it's going too fast.
<Page65>
"You get it?　If you're just seeing things, there's no problem, but don't try to see what you can't see.
　At most, your blood vessels will burst and your brain will be overloaded. If you go beyond that, you might end up turning into stone while still alive."
<Page66>
"You should be grateful to the sorcerer who made you those glasses.
　Most psychics use their powers without realizing how dangerous they are and end up crippling themselves.
　...... Well, maybe they're happier because they're human beings who are existentially unfit to live in human society."
<Page67>
"-----"
"And apparently, that's why I'm here.
　　　　I'm going to get you back to the life you had before."
<Page68>
　That's what the doctor said, and he made me these glasses.
　I have so much ...... to be thankful for, and my heart hurts.
　That person really in many ways, that day seven years ago, had saved the current Tono Shiki.
<Page69>
"And then...
"I'm not sure what to say.
<Page70>
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　It's not good for the heart.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page71>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not going to give you my glasses.
"That's not what I meant.
　What are you going to do now?　I don't think there's gonna be any more dead people, so why don't we just say goodbye for tonight?
<Page72>
"............"
　It's eleven o'clock in the evening.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm going to...
C:>I'm not sure what to make of it.
C:>You'll be able to find out more about ......

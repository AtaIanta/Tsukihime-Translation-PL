　I stopped by the convenience store, but only a few minutes had passed.
　It's time to go to school, half an hour earlier than usual.
<Page2>
　The school uniforms on the sidewalk are sparse.
　In another ten minutes, the main gate would be packed with students, but right now there are only two or three people, including myself, walking around.
　There is no sign of the woman who was so beautiful she looked like a lie, sitting on the guardrail waiting for someone.
<Page3>
　In the schoolyard, the athletic club was in the middle of their morning practice.
　I walked to the entrance of the school.
　I like to move my body. Because it makes me feel alive.
<Page4>
　But I could not join the club activities.
　I'm chronically anemic, so I'd be a nuisance to everyone around me when I needed to be, and I've been firmly advised by my doctor to refrain from excessive exercise.
<Page5>
　When I was a freshman, I had opportunities to be invited to club activities.
　Each time, I turned them down, saying, 'Maybe next time.

"It's not that I'm late when I get the time wrong, it's that I get to school early. Shiki-kun is a diligent person, you know. The youngsters of today should be more carefree.
"I'm taking it easy enough. I don't even like to study.
　I'd like to talk to you about your truancy on Friday. ......
<Page11>

Because they are all so young and look so delicious. I think it's inevitable that they should stretch themselves and go out to play for a day or so.
"No, it's not like I was playing with them or anything. ......
<Page14>
"Oh, I'm kidding.

"I'm not sure what to do about the anemia. I'm feeling particularly good this morning."
<Page17>
"Yes. I'm glad to hear that. Then you can go back to your carefree student life from today.
By the way. You say you have chronic anemia, but how long have you had that condition?　Was it born that way?
<Page18>
"What?　I wasn't born with it. I had an accident when I was a kid, and ever since then...
"I'm sorry to hear that, ....... That's why you stopped exercising and why you lost your appetite.
　So, what was it like?
<Page19>
"Yes?"
　I couldn't help but raise my voice at the unintelligible question.
　Dr. Noel licked his lips with his tongue.
<Page20>
"I asked her what kind of accident it was.
　You were injured so badly that you went crazy, weren't you?
　It hurt so badly that you were crying out in fear, wasn't it?　You must have been so scared that you cried out.
<Page21>
"------"
　...... An unspeakable chill runs through me.
　It's not just the insensitive remarks of Noel's teacher. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
　The reason I didn't say anything is because I don't remember any of the details of the accident.
<Page22>
"...... It was just an accident. It's not a big deal. It's time to go, and I'm off.

<Page25>
　I thought I was the first to arrive, but I saw some of my classmates in the classroom.
"'You're early, Tono. What happened to you on Friday?"
"''Good morning. I was sick on Friday. Are you done with your morning practice?
<Page26>
"Yeah, yeah. We're talking about not only after-school club activities but also morning practice. We've just replaced the captain, and we can't take control like this. You know?"

　Five minutes before homeroom.
　I'm chewing on my happiness that the day's classes will begin without incident.
<Page29>
"Yoo-hoo, slacker!　Ohayo gozaimasu!"
"------"
　From behind me, I heard a voice that ruined my morning.
<Page30>
"Good morning, delinquent!　You were nice enough to go AWOL on Friday!
　It's a great way to make sure you don't end up in a situation where you can't get out of the house.
What, you slept in on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, didn't you?
<Page31>
"I'm not sick and I'm not poor.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website and see if you can find anything you like. It was too much trouble, so I missed school.
<Page32>
"Really? It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web. I'm really jealous of you!
<Page33>
　Arihiko shows tremendous strength.
　You can learn from this man's rebellious spirit.
<Page34>
"I'll tell you what, I'm not used to it.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.　Arihiko, do you know the house in Tono?
<Page35>
"No, I don't. I'm sure you've heard of it.　You can't see it unless you go inside the grounds.
　No, I want to see it because I'm a toothless turtle. But, you know, your house has great security, right?
<Page36>
"I don't know about that. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for and how to get there. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page37>
"You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.　It's like an ant hell, isn't it?
"What?　What?
　If you catch the thief before the police do, your security is not weak, but excellent.
<Page38>
"No, that's why. The thief probably didn't come out in the first place.
"I see. Then no rumors will spread.

　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.

"Yes, yes. Have you seen the scene of the accident on Saturday?　The big fire in front of the north exit station. I heard it was a fire that broke out in the basement.
"...... No, I haven't seen it yet. I've only heard about it.
<Page41>
"You see, there was a department store at the north exit before it was renovated. The park that used to be in front of it is all caved in underground. It's so bad, it'll probably take a year to put it back together.
　But it's not all bad. The security guards and TV stations are all over the place, and the newcomers at the north entrance have gone underground.
<Page42>
"I don't know about that. ...... So, what about the hotel at Kuranagyo Bridge Station?
"The hotel in Kuramiyabashi is the Dome Hotel?　Oh, ...... that's right, there was a fire over there too. I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page43>
　...... You can't blame Arihiko for being frivolous.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money to spend, you'll be able to take advantage of it.

"Hmm... Yumizuka and you both have been behaving badly lately, haven't you?
"I'm not denying that you're behaving badly, but ...... Yumizuka-san, what's wrong?
<Page46>
"He's been absent since Thursday. He didn't show up this morning either. He's been an honor student for a long time, so maybe he's just overwhelmed. But he can't play because he's not ready.
"..............."
　Arihiko's metaphors are rather unique.#I'm not sure what to say.
<Page47>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I'll be back in a few days.
<Page48>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm sure he'll be holed up in the infirmary.
　It seems to be his turn to boycott class today.

"So, did you know that there was a new victim on the news this morning?
　He was killed by a street thug last night and his blood was drained.

　If it was your handiwork that did this, I...
<Page8>
"Oh. That's not true.
　It's not me, it's another vampire."
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page9>
"------"
　I'm not sure what to say, but I'll try.
　It's not too early to be relieved.
　It's a good idea to have a vampire in your life.
<Page10>
"I'm not sure what to make of that.　Did a new vampire come along right after Vrouve?
<Page11>
"No way. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for and what you need to do to get it.
　There are no new vampires coming to eat this city, and Vrouve had nothing to do with it. ...... Vrouve had nothing to do with it. ......?
<Page12>
What do you mean, "nothing to do with ......"?
"I mean what I said. ...... God, Shiki, you're so sharp and yet you're so out of it.
<Page13>
"Okay?　Vrove was a vampire, but was he sucking human blood?
"Of course he was a vampire. I mean, he was burning people all over the place.
<Page14>
　Yeah, right.
　Why didn't you notice such a simple difference?
　The victims of street murders are found as undamaged bodies after the blood has been drained.
<Page15>
　But not Vrouve.
　He burns the bodies. He sucks blood, but that's not his primary method of killing.
<Page16>
　In fact, the hotel victims were treated as fire casualties, not as murders.
　So---Vlove has absolutely no connection to the serial murders going on in the city. ......!
<Page17>
"Wait a minute. I'm sure you've heard of them.
　Who in the hell would do something like that?
<Page18>
"So, it was a different vampire than Vroob.
　I've come to this city to kill that vampire.
<Page19>
"I'm not sure what to make of that.

　I'm not sure what to make of this. ...... The fight that night was pointless.
　Killing ...... Vrove hadn't solved anything.
<Page27>
　The ...... vampires were still in town---and I was going to put the blame, if only temporarily, on this guy.
　...... No.
　The emptiness and self-loathing are circling around me.
<Page28>
"It's ...... bad. I know I'm being persistent, but let me check one last time.
　Vrove has nothing to do with the vampire murders, and it's another vampire that's been haunting the city for the past month,......?
<Page29>
"Yes, that's what I meant.

<Page32>
"It's just a question of time. I'm not sure what to make of it. Hey, why did you get three minutes?
"...... Why what?
<Page33>
"You said you only had three minutes, Shiki. I don't understand why it was three minutes at all.
"...... You know what? I told you, that place is like the bottom of the ocean. That's why I said you only had three minutes.
<Page34>
"What?　Three minutes at the bottom of the ocean?
"------
　...... Good.
　If I'd had more energy, I'd have said it back in no time.
<Page35>
"Well, you're right. People, unlike you, can only stay under water for that long.
<Page36>
"What? I've been a little cold myself!
　It's boring to be under the sea for hours on end!
"It was a little cold. Oh, really?
　I thought I was going to die.
"What?　Look down. What's wrong?
<Page37>
"...... No, I'm just dizzy. Don't worry about it. ...... No, you should.
　In fact, if you dive into the sea, even three minutes is doubtful. I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm not sure what to make of it.

　I didn't ...... say that, did I?
　But I feel like it's my fault because he got so mad at me. ...... It was all over the place, too. It's kind of like the worst.

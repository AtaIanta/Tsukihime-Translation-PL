　I climbed up the slope from the residential area and reached the perimeter of the mansion.
　It was around two o'clock in the morning.
　It's a great way to get a good night's sleep.
<Page2>
"I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I think it's a good idea.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
<Page3>
"Hmm?"
　I'm not sure what it is.
　I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page4>
　------Dokun.
　The first thing that was there was fear.
　A sense of unreality that makes your heart stop.
　But unfortunately, this liver already has a tolerance for such things.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page5>
　I'm not sure what to do. ------
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. It's a good idea.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's just that you can't see well. The outline is just alien.
<Page6>
　It's getting closer and closer.
　And then, and then, and then.
　You can hear the sound of dry footsteps.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
<Page7>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.

　Immediately --- with a snap, the light from the street lamp goes out.
<Page8>
　The moon is certainly out.
　The world suddenly became darkness.
　Boom.
　As if to announce death, my heart jumped up.
　An iron blade approaches the line of the upper arm of the left hand.
　It will be a while before my consciousness catches up with me.
<Page9>
　Before the blade that runs in the darkness is fully extended, the tip of the cut is flicked up from below, deflected and surpassed.
"---Ku."
　The mouth of the shadow distorts. You can recognize that it is a laugh.
　But first--
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but it's a good idea.
<Page10>
"......!"
　There is surprise. But the thought is calm. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation. I'm not sure what to do. The time is frozen. Even the fact that I am being attacked is not worthy of surprise at the moment.
<Page11>
　The two murder weapons spark in the darkness.
　The unnatural darkness hides even the appearance of each other.
　And yet, in the midst of it all.
　The connection of life shines clearly.
<Page12>
　The knife that comes out is cut away as predicted.
　---Amazing.
　In this darkness, the deadly weapon wielded without a pause was precisely stopped by my own body.
<Page13>
　Is it easy to read the opponent's behavior?
　That too. No, no.
　It's just that my arm is following the lines and dots that I can see with my naked eye.
　The only thing I can see is that, so I'm just swinging my dagger at it as fast as I can.
<Page14>
　My head.
　My head hurts.
　White hot thoughts.
　My chest hurts.
　My head hurts. The old wound in the chest is hot.
　My eyes feel like they're going to spill out of their sockets.
<Page15>
　But I remember.
　There was a time, I'm sure, when this happened.
　It was, yeah.
　The corpse of a child covered in blood.
　And Akiha's crying face covered in blood.
　And my hands, covered in blood...
<Page16>
　The impact of metal biting metal.
　The instinct that transcends reason plays the blade.
　Watch out. I've just lost consciousness for a moment.
　But I won't screw up again.
　Because I know where I'm being targeted. As long as you know, your instincts will cut through this before your reasoning.
<Page17>
　The reason why I know is simple.
　The part he is targeting is the "line" of my body.
　So, you don't need to read where he is aiming.
　It's just a matter of preventing the most appropriate line to aim at in this posture and at this distance.
<Page18>
　When I became aware of this fact as a strategy, I finally realized that
"You... you can see me?"
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
<Page19>
　----.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　This is a great way to make sure that you do not have to worry about your own safety.
<Page20>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　The heart sends blood higher than ever.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　I'm sure you'll agree. I'm not sure what to do. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page21>
"Ha, ha."
　It doesn't matter. What do you care now? It's a great way to make sure you get the most out of your vacation. I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you. Remember that cold wave. The Vrouve was amazing. He's nothing compared to that vampire. Yes, he is. Even if you are Alcade's objective.
　Under these conditions, I'm definitely the better...!
<Page22>
　I'm attacking.
　I'm attacking.
　I'm the one who's attacking.
　And this guy is responding with everything he's got. In other words. It's not that I'm preventing it, it's that this guy is preventing it.
<Page23>
　You can win ----.
　I don't know who you are, but I'm pretty sure it's you.
　I'm the one who's pressuring him now.
　I have goosebumps. I'm elated with the overwhelming advantage.
　I can win. I'm stronger than this guy.
　Because I'm stronger than him.
　If he tries to kill me, I'll just kill him back.
<Page24>
　I'll pop the enemy's weapon and send it flying.
　Take a step forward. In order to cut the "line" of the defenseless chest, thrust the dagger like a fang.
　Oh, but it's natural.
　In this situation, why is it that there is no stagnation in the hand that wields the murder weapon?
<Page25>
"What?"
　As the lights of the city lights returned, the thoughts that had been heated up switched to normal.
<Page26>
　There is no one in front of you.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　A long, thin object had stabbed him in the stomach and sent him flying to the wall of the mansion.
<Page27>
　---I can't grasp the situation at all.
　The person who attacked me,......, is that a man,......, was pierced by something like a pipe that flew from the side.
<Page28>
　The impact of this may have sent you to the wall.
　It's a fatal wound if you are a human being.
　But no matter how you look at it, that man can't be human.
<Page29>
"Jamma, Wo".
　The voice was hoarse.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　There.

"------"
　Our gazes meet.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.

<Page34>
"'Cathedral, that'."
　With the words, a light rose up.
<Page35>
　The sound of the wind reappearing.
　She readied her huge spear.
　She had jumped down from the top of the street lamp at the man.
<Page36>
""Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!""
　The man who was cut off shouts.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
<Page37>
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　The bloodshot eyes with nothing but murderous intent.

"-----"
　You can't help but be stunned.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　There was no trace of ...... anything, and he disappeared from the world.

"Good evening. I've heard that it's safe at night in this country, but things can get pretty crazy around here. When I was taking a walk for a while, a monster like a vampire attacked my cute student.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page42>
　The woman in the nun's uniform looking back.

"Noel teacher ......, are you sure?"
"I'm sorry. That's right. It's not bad to be a teacher, but this is outside the school.　I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one.
<Page44>
　You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of.

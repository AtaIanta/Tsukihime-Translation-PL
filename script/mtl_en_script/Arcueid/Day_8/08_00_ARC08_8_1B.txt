"...... Hmm. No lip marks on the neck. No rejection of the holy water smeared on my shoes. In addition, there is no transformation of the fanny face that I like.
　Yes, heresy screening is over. You can stand up, Tono Shiki?"
<Page2>
　The foot placed on the chest is separated.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page3>
"You'll be able to find a lot more than just a pair of glasses. Be careful not to drop anything, okay?"
"...... I see. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page4>
　It's a good idea to take the glasses from Noel and put them back on.
　I'm not sure what to make of this. ......
　What is the situation with this?
<Page5>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. I threatened him with my advice, but he almost ate it.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
"..................
　I can only be stunned.
<Page6>
"What's that?　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　I'm not sure if you've heard of this vampire?
"..............."
<Page7>
"You're not listening. I'm sure you've heard of it. ...... Oh yeah, they don't care about small fry like me. Well, that's fine. I don't want to be talked about.
<Page8>
"It's a good idea. I'll give you a quick lecture.
　I'm sure you've heard of it.　Like that?
　It's a good idea to have a shadowy organization that protects human society from those damn vampires.
<Page9>
　I'm not sure how serious I am about this, but Noel says with a chuckle.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page10>
"I'm sure you've heard of it.
"Yes, that agent.
　I'm sure you've heard of it.　In the event that you're in a position to do so, you'll be able to do so with the help of a professional. Even in this land of the end times."
<Page11>
"I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page12>
　I'm sure you've heard of it.
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where and the best way to get in touch with us, please do not hesitate to contact us.
<Page13>
"...... I understand. It's hard to believe that it came out of nowhere, but I believe it. It's the second time I've done this, no matter what.
　Thank you for saving me from a dangerous situation."
<Page14>
"Second time ......?　Oh, ......, that's right.
　But this time it's different. It's not like I stumbled into a dangerous situation. I was aiming for you from the beginning.
<Page15>
"You've been trying to kill me since the beginning. ......?
"Yeah. I've been following you since you left the house.
　My job is to destroy vampires. If someone is following a vampire, it's natural to keep an eye on them, right?
<Page16>
"------"
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page17>
"Well, that's...
"I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.　I can't do it alone, and my master was sent away by his boss.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.
<Page18>
"....... Are you talking about me, the smaller fish?
<Page19>
"Yes. You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier. It is a handsome and tasty prey for both vampires and us.
　---I'm not sure what to do.
　I've been watching you for a few days now, but you don't seem like you're being forced to obey me, and you're not sucking my blood, are you?　You know, Shiki?　I'm sure you're not the only one.
<Page20>
"------"
　I furrowed my brow and swallowed my words.
　You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page21>
"I'm not sure what to say. Do you want to be one of the vampires?
　You want to live forever?"
<Page22>
"What about ------?"
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time and money.
<Page23>
"...... No, but...
　It's a great way to get the most out of your money.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page24>
"It's not the same.　Then why?"
"'...... It's obvious. I'm just trying to help hunt down vampires for the city we live in.
<Page25>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not going to ...... fight with this person.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page26>
"I'm not sure what to say. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　Unfortunately, you can't do that to a mere mortal. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page27>
　Noel turns his back and walks away.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. I'm not sure what to make of this. ...... No, or. You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page28>
"But be warned. I'm not sure if you've heard of it, but I'm sure you've heard of it. I meant something deeper than that.
　The mortals that have nested in this city have been taking root for more than a few years.
　My mentor says they didn't just arrive yesterday like the true ancestors.
<Page29>
"Vampires don't just come from outside.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web. They're often in the homes of the most powerful people in town.
<Page30>
"You know?　You said that they are protecting their own city.
　I don't think that's so vague. I think you need to protect yourself.
"Well, what do you mean?
<Page31>
"What do you mean?
　I'm sure you're not the only one. You're not the one who's going around killing vampires, you're the one who's human.
"------"
"Hmm. I'll see you again when I'm alive, Tono Shiki."
<Page32>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　As she left, she cast her gaze over the lamppost.
"Alright, let's jump home in style. Oh, but I can't.
　It's impossible to jump that high without a runner, if you could, you wouldn't be human."
　I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one who's had a bad experience.
<Page33>
"That's the ...... one that seems like a great person ......."
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page34>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　But it's not.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page35>
"I'm not sure what to make of it." -----
　I was released from the tension and the dizziness returned.
　Leaning against the fence, I begin to walk toward the main gate.
<Page36>
　...... My chest hurts.
　While I'm still conscious, I'll manage to get back to my room before my body collapses from my feet.
　You can think about the ...... hard stuff afterwards.
<Page37>
　...... But the main gate was farther away than I expected.
　The comfort of the headache fading away.
　It's a horrible feeling when your headache fades and your whole body relaxes.
　I left my back against the wall and stared at myself as I drifted off to sleep.

　When I returned to the classroom after lunch, I saw Arihiko.
　He wasn't there in the morning, so he must have simply come to have lunch.
<Page2>
"Oh Tono, good morning.
"..............."
　The president's attendance is also very high.
　In the event that you're not sure what you're looking for, there are a few things you can do.
　I'm really glad that Alcade went home quietly.

"I'm not sure what to say. What's with those cold eyes?
"It's a shame, but if you take out the autograph ticket, it's a CD that sells for 10 yen a piece.
<Page4>
"Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I had a little trouble and I was tired, so I couldn't hide my true feelings. I'll be careful next time.
"You're serious? But what you should hide is what you just said.

　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your day.
<Page6>
"Well, thanks for another day. I'm going to go save the world for a bit with a bunch of friends over the internet.#I'm going to save the world.

"What's with the suddenness?
There are not many spots that are as dangerous as the North Exit Department Store. ...... If I had to guess, I'd say that. I'm not sure if it's the abandoned hospital in Kushizuka.　It used to be a meeting place for a group of bikers until two years ago, but no one's following it anymore.
<Page9>
"I'm sure you've heard of it.　But it's only natural that an abandoned building would be noisy, but normally no one would stop by.
<Page10>
"No, that's why. No, that's why. No one is there anymore. One day, all the Yankees suddenly disappeared. Nearly thirty people are missing, and they're still being reported missing.
　Well, this is a ghost story, not a violent incident like the one at the north exit. Now it's a place where even vagrants don't settle down, like a bad loan from the government."
<Page11>
　The homeroom meeting to decide the program for next month's cultural festival was unexpectedly difficult.
　As a result of the various opinions flying around and the conflicting opinions of the boys and girls, the decision was postponed until next week.
<Page12>
　After-school club activities are prohibited.
　All students will be dismissed from school as soon as possible.
<Page13>
"---- Well..."
　There's no point in sitting around in the classroom in a daze.
　After this.
C:>...... Shall we go to the abandoned hospital or something?
C:>Let's just go back to the mansion for the night.

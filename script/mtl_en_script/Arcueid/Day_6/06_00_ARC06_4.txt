　The afternoon of the holiday passed without incident.
　After that, I went back to my room to dawdle, and before I knew it, it was time for dinner.
<Page2>
"'...... I'm dumbfounded. Forget about it, I ......"
　I shake off the blonde woman that has stuck in my brain.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a good idea to take a look at a few of the most common types of shoes and boots.
<Page3>

　It was about an hour ago that Akiha returned.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page6>
"...... Jade. I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page7>
"I'm not sure what to say. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
"...... So Akiha's silence is simply because she's in a bad mood?
<Page8>
"...... I'm sorry. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. ...... I'm just guessing, but I think Akiba is tired.
"...... I see. I'm sure you're right. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. It's really a lot of hard work.
<Page9>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier and more enjoyable. I'm not going to take the chance of shaking the topic. I'm not sure what to do about it.
<Page10>
"I'm sure you can hear me, brother.
　It's not that I'm tired from the afternoon inspection. It's a good idea to eat quietly, because that's our family manner.
<Page11>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　You can find a lot of people who are interested in this type of product. I'm not sure what to do.
<Page12>
"You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
　If you want to talk about the events of the day, you can do so without hesitation.
<Page13>
　I nodded my head and resumed eating.
　I'm not sure if it's because I had a small breakfast and lunch, but my appetite came back in the evening.
　...... Still, tonight's menu is somewhat painful on the eyes.
　Not only the beef fillet and foie gras, but the bright red sauce reminds me of blood, which undeniably reminds me of the events of yesterday.
<Page14>
　A sudden murder. An unlikely reunion. Unlikely monsters.
　The fingers stretched out on the back of so much death, and the touch of death.
　And --- the natural farewell that I knew would happen if I defeated the vampire.
"...............
　I'm not sure what to do. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page15>
"So.
　How did you spend your afternoon off, my brother, who worked so hard on my work?
"''Heh?　Ah, ah, you mean me. I went for a walk in the afternoon, and when I got back to my room I lay in bed all day."
<Page16>
"Is it ...... that, um, anemia again?
"No, I was just thinking and before I knew it, it was night. I don't feel bad, and my legs are fine.
<Page17>
"So you wasted a lot of time for nothing.
　...... Haha. It's a good idea to keep your eyes and ears open. I don't think anything of it, but if other people hear it, they'll just laugh at you."
<Page18>
　It was an unrelenting and irrefutable impression of Akiha.
　Be that as it may.
<Page19>
"You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　You can find a lot more information on the web.
　But Akiha doesn't think anything of it, why?"
　Could it be that he just looks strict but is generous to his immediate family?
<Page20>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not expecting anything from Tono Shiki.
　I know from the beginning that my brother is that kind of person."
<Page21>
"..............."
　It's a great idea.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　This is exactly what I mean when I say I have no idea what to expect.
<Page22>
"No, thank you for the food."
"Thanks for the food. I have some lessons to learn after dinner, so I'll leave you to it.
Brother?　I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.
<Page23>
　Akiha stood up from her seat and left the dining hall.
　The evening's lesson was a violin performance that was scheduled for the evening. This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page24>
"I'm not sure what to say.　Don't lose to Akiba-sama!
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where and the best way to get in touch with us, please do not hesitate to contact us.
<Page25>
　After dinner, I took an early bath and then returned to my room.
　I sat down at the study desk provided.
　As Akiha said, I spread out a reference book to pay for the daytime I spent in self-degradation.
<Page26>
　I'm not sure if you've heard of this, but I'm sure you've heard of it. You can find a lot of things to do.
<Page27>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to do.
　But no matter how you try, you can't concentrate.
　What comes to mind is.
　I have no need for her anymore, and she should be forgotten.
<Page28>
"Oh God, not today!"
　I gave up and lay down on my bed and stared at the ceiling for no reason.
<Page29>
　...... It's okay. This is only until tonight.
　For better or worse, it was a turbulent two days.
　It's crazy to forget that so easily.
　You'll need a day to cool down.
<Page30>
　For now, I'm drifting in and out of consciousness without doing anything.
　This is a great way to make sure that you don't have to worry about your own safety.
　You will find that most of the events will be in the past. ......
<Page31>
"......
　Eventually, your eye lids begin to fall.
　Consciousness slowly closes in.
　An unbearable darkness envelops the senses.
<Page32>
　The ...... peacefully passed holiday ended like this.
　As I lay in bed, I fell into a vague sleep, as if tricking myself.

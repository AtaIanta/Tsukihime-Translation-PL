　Let's take a look at the museum.
　I think there is not so much change from seven years ago, but there may be discoveries that can only be made from the perspective of now grown up.
<Page2>
　---Well.
　As a conclusion of looking around the mansion for about one hour.
<Page3>
"Isn't there too many off-limits sections?
　I couldn't help but ask for consent even though there was no one around.
<Page4>
　The Tono mansion's main building was as wide as a hotel, and there were also many rooms that were 'off-limits only to those concerned' like a hotel.
<Page5>
　Especially, the second floor of the east wing was terrible.
It's not "terrible" but "amazing".
　What can I say, there is pressure.
　The other rooms are locked so you can't get in, but the second floor of the east wing is not blocked by a lock or door.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to take advantage of it.
<Page6>
"If you enter without permission, you will definitely be killed.
　If you enter without permission, I will kill you. ......"
<Page7>
　Mostly from Akiba.
　In the event that you're just paranoid, or perhaps I'm just being overly cautious, then I wouldn't enter the second floor of the East Wing because I feel that it's a social life crisis.
<Page8>
"Yeah, that's the right answer.
　You should not enter the living space of the head of the family without permission. Even if it's a family member.
　I'm sure that's how it's always been here, Shiki.
<Page9>
"---"
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　I turned around and there it was.
<Page10>
"It's a good idea to take a look at the details of your own personal life.　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
"Thank you for that. I wouldn't want a stranger walking around my house, either.
<Page11>
"You're the only one who doesn't know me, but we'll let that slide. We are not in a position to get deeply involved with each other. It's an itch.
　Today---yes, I know.
　I've been a little distracted myself. I saw the back of your head, and it reminded me of old times. I called out to you.
<Page12>
"Did you ...... see me and remember the old days?"
　...... Could that be...?
<Page13>
"I'm not sure. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. This is how he used to walk around the mansion.
<Page14>
"Did I tell you that Makihisa-san had a deep knowledge of plants?
　I've had a few nibbles myself. We used to go to the botanical garden there and talk.
"The ...... entrance to the botanical garden is locked up tight.
<Page15>
"The entrance. The back door can be opened with a simple key.
　The back door can be opened with a simple key, and I think it's Miss Amber who has it.　Thankfully, she's still taking care of it as best she can.
<Page16>
"............
　That's a little surprising.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's not a personality that is excessively looked down upon just because it's a servant,......?
<Page17>
"Are you close to Amber?
"I am?　With that servant?　...... is.
　Ha, ha. Ha-ha-ha.#Hahahaha!"
<Page18>
　The man chuckled sarcastically, then began to laugh in earnest.
　I don't need to ask what was so funny.
　The ...... Saiki Gyojin is now laughing at the ridiculousness of the person in front of him.
<Page19>
"Did I say something ...... funny, me?"
"I'm not sure what to say.
　Yes, that was my fault. After all, it's not your fault. It was just a bad question, that's all.
<Page20>
"I'm not that close to Miss Amber. It was only after Akiha became the head of the family that I began to talk to her.
　She is also the secretary of Akiha. Inevitably, there are more opportunities for conversation.
　If anything, though, I'm more acquainted with Miss Jade."
<Page21>
"Eh?"
　This is the second unexpected.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web to get a better idea of what you're looking for.
<Page22>
"It's a long time ago, that's for sure.
　I'm not sure what to do. I'm sure you'll agree.
　Well. I've been in the sun too much. My skin mustn't itch."
<Page23>
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.
<Page24>
"I forgot to ask the main question.
　How do you feel, seeing the mansion for the first time in seven years?
"I'm not particularly surprised. It is only on the first floor that you can match your memories from when you were a child.
<Page25>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　...... But yes, it is. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page26>
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page27>
"I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it. ...... I'll try to get into that next. ......
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a good idea to have a little bit of information about him or her as a means of self-defense.
<Page28>
"Well, that's the thing.
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.
　It's a good idea to regain your composure and resume your search for the mansion.
　This time,......, let's go out to the courtyard.

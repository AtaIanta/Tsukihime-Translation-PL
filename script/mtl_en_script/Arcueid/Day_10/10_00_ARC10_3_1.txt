<Page13>

"I don't care what it is. They all look the same to me. I'll put up with boredom. It's a boat ride, isn't it?
<Page14>

<Page18>
"I'm telling you, it's daytime, it's hard, you're sleepy, it doesn't matter.
　I'll be fine here for ten minutes. Next time you say something like, "You're a vampire," I'll get angry!

"...... So, what kind of princess are you? What's something, for example?
"Like, uh, squirrelly?
"What?

<Page24>
　....... A couple of men and women by the wall a short distance away were just playing such games.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web, as well as the information on the internet.
　This is why ...... couples who don't mind being seen are ......!
<Page25>
"It's not a good idea. Shiritori is not good."
"Why not?　They said that couples waiting for a movie are supposed to play hide and seek.
<Page26>
"That's just nonsense, don't worry about it. It's just a joke. Get your cell phone and scour the Internet for news.
"Really?　They look like they're having fun, those two.
<Page27>
"Those two look like they're having fun no matter what they're doing!
　I've never been good at playing Shiritori. It makes me sad. That's the only thing I'll reject no matter what."
"Shiki, you're weak at Shiritori?　Do you have a limited vocabulary?
<Page28>
"It's not that I'm weak, I'm just bad at it. It's not that I'm weak, it's just that I'm not very good at it.
　...... It's five minutes ago, so let's go in. Here's your ticket. You can show it to them when you go in. They'll take half the ticket, but that's the deal, so don't get mad.

　---They leave the cinema.
　The movie that Alcade and I saw was a love story, and while it wasn't boring, it wasn't particularly interesting either.
　It was a typical French film, with no exciting scenes, and an emphasis on a calm atmosphere.
<Page33>
　Alcade is walking next to me in silence.
"............"
　...... The silence is awkward.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

　---I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page36>
"No, but...
　It's up to the individual to decide whether it was funny or boring, but was it really that funny?
<Page37>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I mean, I knew about it, but it was just a trivial fantasy.
<Page38>
"I think it's good that it's dark. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　But above all, the content was good!
　I was amazed at how they were able to create such a fictional story. Compared to the detail of that scene, the images I create are like child's play, and I'm really impressed.

"I'm sorry.　I'm not sure what to say.
　Are you saying it was boring?
"No, it wasn't boring, but it was ordinary.
　If it was, there are more interesting things to do.
<Page42>
"No. You know, that was really good.
<Page43>
"...... Well, I think it's a low point for .......
　It's not on right now because it's out of season, but the big movies are several times less boring than that. For the record, the one I just watched ranks right around the bottom of the middle."
<Page44>
"Amazing."
"...... You express your emotions in a way that's easy to understand, Alcade."
<Page45>
　It's not that I was surprised, but I was taken aback.

"'...... Too bad. It's a shame, because up until yesterday there was a good movie on. If I had known you would be so happy, I would have brought you here at night."

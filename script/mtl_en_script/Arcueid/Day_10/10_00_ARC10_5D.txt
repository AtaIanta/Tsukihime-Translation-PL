　The hands of the clock are advancing steadily.
　I'm not sure how long it's been since I came to the park, but it's been nearly two hours.
<Page2>
"---Huh."
　My body has long since calmed down, and there are no more people in sight.
　This is the time when the night dwellers, whether human or vampire, start to move.
<Page3>
"'Alcade, isn't it about time?
"''Yes, I think it's about time.''
　While agreeing with my opinion, Alcade still does not seem to be on board.
<Page4>
"I'm not sure what to make of that. I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to say.

　This was a complete turnaround.
　What is this, a spinning kaleidoscope?

"I knew it.　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. I'm not sure what to do.
　So, after a while, I found out that you are just a human being.
<Page12>
"It's just a hair's breadth, that one. See? I'm not sure what to make of it.#
<Page13>
"...... Wait a minute.
　I don't think you did anything to that guy who was trying to pick you up.
<Page14>
"No, I didn't do anything. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　...... If I hadn't remembered Shiki's words, I might have done something about it.
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.

　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to use it for a lot of things.
<Page18>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　The search for vampires and the line of death is a little bit in the corner now.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page19>
"I'm sure you'll agree. I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to do.
"I'm not sure what it is. Is there something wrong?
"Yes. Here, that clock. It's just in time.

　In the event you're not sure what to do, you'll be able to find out.

<Page21>
　The time of the appointment.
　It is a verbal promise to meet here at ten o'clock in the evening.
　I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one.

"-------"
　For some reason, I'm at a loss for words.

<Page25>
"I'm sorry.
What?
"...... You know, you...
　---- Don't do that boring shit.#"Yeah, what am I?
"...... Are you really a vampire?"
　---- What kind of answer are you expecting, man?
<Page26>
"Are you a vampire? ...... Shiki, what are you talking about now?
"It's not a new thing. It's just that now I'm thinking about it.

<Page27>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　It's not that I don't care, but it's a terrible insult. What is your basis for saying such a thing, let me hear it.
<Page28>
　There is no basis.
　But just as importantly, there is no proof that you are a vampire.
　So...
<Page29>
"You don't even like the sight of blood, do you? There's no such thing as a vampire. You say you're half-human, but I think a vampire who's never sucked blood is less than half-human.#No.

　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.　I'm sorry.
<Page35>
　...... I was relieved.
　I spit it out uncontrollably, but I couldn't help but think that this question would hurt Alcade, or so it seemed.
　Thank God Alcuade took it as a joke.
<Page36>
"'It's ......, isn't it? Alquade doesn't look like a vampire by any stretch of the imagination."
<Page37>
"'Well, let's give it a try then.'
　Laughing mischievously, Alcuade mouthed the words.
"Yeah, sure, if you want to try it out...?"
<Page38>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what's going on.

　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's not Alcade's power, but my own, I swallowed the words.

　It's a good idea. Another step.
　I'm not sure what to do.

"I'm not sure what to say. It's easy to suck blood.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page43>
　The breathing comes closer.
　The fingertips touch.
　You can feel Alcade's weight on your shoulders and all over your body.
"-------"
　It is. It was a heartbeat that nearly knocked me unconscious.
<Page44>
　I want. I want. I want it. I want.
　Desperately suppress the emotions that come out of control.
　The left arm which shivers to stir the back, and
　The right arm which wants to embrace and is irresistible, and
　I suppress it hard.
　I want it so badly. There is no way I can stand it. Still, you should not seek this woman now.
<Page45>
　Because everything is different.
　Stronger than that time. More intense than that time.
　The thing you want is fundamentally different from that time.
　It's not that I want to kill her.
　It's a different impulse, and if you're saying that she's going to go this crazy.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with us.

"Al -----."
　I try to call her name, but she shuts up.
　It means that you don't trust her.
<Page49>
　It's over.
　This is the end of such shenanigans, and with his usual smile, Alcade should say.
"I'm not going to suck your blood, after all.
<Page50>
"------"
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　The soft touch becomes a sharp pain.
　You will find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page51>
　---It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　My thoughts are clean, and there is nothing to fear. Not now, not yet.
　But only Alcade was trembling.
<Page52>
　Painful breathing.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
　I can't see his face.
　Only the breath on her neck overlaps with the trembling of her body.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page53>
"Al---quaid?"
　I couldn't ...... stand it, and I said the name.
"It's a joke -----."

　---I'm not sure what to do. It's a good idea.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　The reason why the alarm bells ring.
　The arm moves to push away the body of Alcade.
<Page57>
　But it is too late.
　Everything is too late.
　When is it.
　Now? Was it just five minutes ago? Or was it a day ago... or was it when we first met?
<Page58>
"Ha-ha-ha-ha... Ha--"
　The disordered breath rises from the neck to the brain marrow.
　It tells her arousal like a substance in the brain that runs around.
<Page59>
"You're... you're..."
　The sound of instinct slipping into the earlobe.
　There is no need for crude arm strength. The sweet panting is all that's needed.
<Page60>
"Shiki...want..."
　The whole body, the spirit is melted.
<Page61>
"-- ------, -------"
　Touch the neck.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　The moment.
"------, ah."
　My reasoning collapsed.
<Page62>
　It was a fundamental fear.
　It was a providence that could not be resisted.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do.
<Page63>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　Teeth that spiked like a mountain range.
　The flexing of the power like a waterfall that cannot be communicated.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to make use of it for a lot of things.
<Page64>
　In the body of a person who has escaped the natural order, return to the primitive order.
　I can't do anything.
　Even the fingertips do not move.
<Page65>
　What does it mean to be eaten?
　Is this what it means to be in the position of just being preyed upon?
　In front of this life.
　In front of this life, we're nothing more than droplets to be swallowed...
<Page66>
"Hee...#"
　The fangs pierce the neck.
　The only thing in my head was fear.
"[ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00 ber00][ber00][ber00]"
<Page67>
　I scream.
　The moment when I thought that I, myself, heard my own voice and was pathetic.
　I'm not sure if it's just my imagination, but it's a good idea.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.

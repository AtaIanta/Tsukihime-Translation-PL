　---Let's go to Alcade's apartment.
　He might have given up hunting for the dead tonight and returned to his room.
<Page2>
　Press the ...... doorbell.
　There is no answer to the call no matter how long you wait.
　Throughout the door, you will not feel any sign of movement.
　Are they not coming back?
　Or is it that they just don't come out?
<Page3>
"------"
　A slight hesitation.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page4>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　Before that, I put my hand on the knob just in case.
<Page5>
"......?"
　There was no lock on the door.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page6>
"...... Arquaid, are you there?"
　There was no reply.
　The bed is undisturbed.
　I've been waiting for him in the park since last night, and he came to my room in the morning.

"......!"
　I punched the wall with a gun and immediately ran out of the room.
　It's not the time to be disappointed in your own stupidity.
　If you have time to take it out on the wall, you should go to the city to look for him.
<Page8>
　I walk out in front of the station.
　You can find a lot of people and artificial brightness.
　...... speculation and feet to find a woman.
　It's hopeless, but there's a small chance I'll make it.
　Literally, follow this thin line to find her.

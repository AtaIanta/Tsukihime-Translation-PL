　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to make a living.
<Page5>
　The destination is only a few steps away.
　It's just a matter of getting away from the main street and going down a deserted alleyway.
<Page6>
"What?　What's wrong, Shiki?"
"No, the people around me were staring at me.
　I didn't get this much attention at night.
<Page7>
"Oh, that's not a bad idea.
　I'm trying to preserve the nature. I'm not sure what to do with it.
　I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure if there is a problem?
<Page8>
"By the way, what is the maximum amount of this nature protection?
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
"It's fine. This was a problem of my small mind.
"What?
<Page9>
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page10>
　That's fine.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　It is also somewhat pleasing to see that people on the street look at this white figure with envy.
　But.
<Page11>
"I'm not sure what to say. I want to have you all to myself today."
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page12>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.

　Auchi.

<Page14>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for and how to get it.
<Page15>
"''Well, wait a minute, Mr. Alcade.
　What request do you think I'm going to make here?"
<Page16>
"You want me to change into a dress.
　Then we'll have a photo shoot.
"Seriously, what's your basis for being so perceptive?
"You've got that look in your eye!
<Page17>
"Yeah.
　It's hard to believe that he would see through that alone.
　They probably got the information beforehand.
　There aren't too many people ...... who know the information here.
<Page18>
"No, I just happened to find out about it myself.
　I was browsing the net before I went to bed and found out that this place was used as a location for a movie about a year ago.
　Since then, sometimes amateur photographers come here with their model eggs to get good shots.
"It's called cosplay. I know it. You don't have to cover it up.
<Page19>
"No, I'm not. I just want to give you the right information.
<Page20>
　Shit.
　I just got hit by a thing that could make you mincemeat.
<Page21>
"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you well.
　Did you say something stupid?

<Page24>
"I'm sorry. I wanted to take another look at that dress you wore when you fought Vlove. ......
<Page25>
"''I'm sorry, please show me the dress you wore when you fought Vrouve again.''
<Page26>
　So, I confessed honestly.
<Page27>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I almost got my revenge in the back alley.
　Regardless of what you mean by revenge.
"Will you change into that outfit?"
<Page28>
"If Shiki wants to see it, fine.
　Turn around and keep your eyes shut.
　It's a recipe that's already five days old, and it's going to take me a few seconds to remember it."
<Page29>
　In one second, I do as Alcade says.
　You're embarrassed to change into your dress.
　Are you embarrassed to change into the dress you lost to Vrouve?
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page30>
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it again.

<Page32>
"I was able to take as many pictures as I wanted.
　It's the first time I've used the camera function on my phone this much.
　It's not often that you get the chance to see such a beautiful dress in person in your life.
Aaah!
<Page33>
　Wait a minute, wait a minute!
　The pictures I just took are all out of focus ......!
<Page34>
"Oh. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
　Have you ever heard of vampires not being reflected in mirrors?
<Page35>
"I've heard that .......
　It's not a mirror, but it's a photograph, it's data!　Isn't that different from a mirror, that hen?
<Page36>
"In terms of being impervious to people's cognitive output, a photograph is more like a mirror, isn't it?
　If it's a portrait, it will remain exactly as it was at the time.
<Page37>
　You want me to draw a picture? .......
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page38>
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
"What?　Of course you can, but what kind?
<Page39>
　What a change of heart.
　I'm sure you'll agree.
<Page40>
"I'm not sure. I have an idea of where I want to go."
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page41>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　The nightmare of the triangle jump on the side of the building came back.
　It's not even a leap this time.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page42>
　In broad daylight, he landed on the roof of the building in a dignified manner.
　Fortunately, or perhaps naturally, there are no people on the roof, so there was no commotion, but
<Page43>
"You know, before you jump, you should say a few words.
<Page44>
"Yes, thank you for your patience, sir.
　Welcome to our secret ballroom.
"------"
<Page45>
　...... I'm speechless.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　If this were a banquet hall, I'd give him a cushion.
<Page46>
"...... Damn it.
　You really have the character to do it back when you get hit, don't you?
<Page47>
"I'm sure you're right.　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
"...
Well, yeah.
　That's for sure.
<Page48>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　You really don't know what you're getting yourself into.
　You don't need to do it back. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page49>
"But why the hell are we on the roof of a building?
　Do you like heights?"
<Page50>
"It was night before, and there was fire.
　It's a great way to get a feel for the city.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page51>
"------"
　It was a surprise, no questions asked.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　As if to be sucked in, the hand to the white body.#Stretch out.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
"I'm sorry. This is a private property.
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page52>
"I'm not sure what to do.　Where did you come from?
"I've been here since the beginning.
　You're really stupid, aren't you?
"What?
<Page53>
"I'm sorry, my words slipped out.
　You have bad eyesight after all. Take a good look.
<Page54>
　It's a good idea to have a look around the rooftop.
　...... Indeed. A tent-like structure was erected near the building's water tower to shield it from the wind.
　This girl was in that tent?
<Page55>
"I'm sure you've noticed. You've been too careless.
　Your whole body must be dull.
　Or are you getting carried away on a date with your girlfriend?
<Page56>
　I don't want you to say anything unpleasant, but what if this guy gets carried away?
　No, I don't mean that now.
<Page57>
"I'm not sure why you would want to put a tent here.
　In the first place, do you know who I am?
　I don't need a stranger to call me "senior".
<Page58>
"We went to the same junior high school. Kagu Junior High.
　He was in the third grade and I was in the first.
　We didn't know each other. We even passed each other a few times in the infirmary."
<Page59>
　...... It seems to be true.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page60>
"But if that's the case, you're not in school anymore. ......
"I'm taking a leave of absence from school for personal reasons. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　You'll be able to find a lot more than just a few of these in the marketplace.
<Page61>
"------"
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. Isn't this a kind of mountain retreat?
<Page62>
I've got the right to say, "Why are you in this place? It's our building. I'll call the cops.
<Page63>
"Gee.
　Then came the worst part.
　It is an indisputable fact that the face and name are known and trespassing if you run away.
<Page64>
　Even though.
　Even if you are brought in out of the blue by that competitive and thoughtful princess.
<Page65>
"Hmm. Are you going to call the cops?"
"............ No, I'm just saying.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I didn't see anything, so you can continue in the next building. I don't want to be bothered by you being here."
<Page66>
　The girl starts walking towards the tent.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother you!
　So, what's your name?
<Page67>
　I call out to her back.
　The girl stops.
"'Mio. It's Saiki Mio.
　You don't have to remember it.
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
<Page68>
　In the end, there was no jumping to the next building after that, and the party time was over.
　This is because I realized the truth that I should go around the stores inside the building instead of on top of it anyway.
<Page69>
　It was also because we realized how much we were getting carried away by the calm suggestion of a third party.
<Page70>
　It was two hours later.
　In response to Arquaid's curiosity, we went to the department store in front of the station.
<Page71>
　For me, it was a familiar scene, but for Alcade, it must have been new.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.

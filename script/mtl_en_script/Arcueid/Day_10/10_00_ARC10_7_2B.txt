<Page2>
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to take advantage of it.
　It's a shortcut, but it's the only way I can do it right now.
<Page3>
"Ugh. ----"
　I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　You can't keep your eyes open for too long.

"I'm not going to be on the main street after all,.......
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.

"I'm not sure what to do.
　Press your fingers to your temples.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your day.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page6>
　...... It's okay, it gets a little easier from here.
　Once you get into the back alleys where people are cut off, the number of lines will be greatly reduced.
　So quickly, let's go to the dark part of this city.
　In the dark, where the moonlight doesn't reach, his white figure should be easy to find...
<Page7>
"Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha ----"
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　You can see the high temperature even in the palm of your hand. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page8>
"......, but here ----.
　The patrol will be the last one around here.
　This is the back alley where I first talked to him.
　If I'm not here, I've made the wrong choice.
<Page9>
"..............., huh?"
　When I stepped into that place, what I felt was a cold air.
<Page10>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　---It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　In the other side of that darkness, sparks are flying with the bee.
　No, to be precise.
　A lot of "deaths" are mixing and matching and disappearing.
<Page11>
"---- No way, that guy."
　The mixed "death line" belongs to the dead.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
"Is he fighting alone in that body ......?"
<Page12>
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　You'll be able to push open the rusty iron door and slide yourself into the dark passage.
<Page13>
　The entrance to the alleyway.
　A narrow path between buildings.
　The number of deaths that burst forth is like a muddy stream.
　Not less than a hundred broken wires in number.
　It's an anomaly. I know the structure of this back. There is no space for a hundred dead bodies.
　So, the scene that is unfolding in the back here.
　It's probably one death being broken up into dozens of pieces.
<Page14>
"------"
　I don't know. I don't think about its meaning.
　What I can't bear.
　It's the creaking of the spine that makes the noise every time you walk down the aisle.
<Page15>
"It is ----- a."
　Saw-like instincts are caressing the medulla oblongata.
　Stop. Don't go. Go back.
　The future is not what you are dreaming of, he said.
<Page16>
"Shut up."
　I know what I'm doing.
　I can't turn back.
　You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
<Page17>
　This is a great way to get the most out of your home.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
<Page18>
"------"
　There.
　There is no such thing as dead flesh anywhere in the world.
<Page19>
　My consciousness freezes.
　My vision is invaded.
　Red liquid waste fills the ground.
　Faceless, arms crushed, guts torn, the traces of the dead violated more than necessary.
<Page20>
　I lose my voice at the smell of blood and the cold air of death.
　The walls, the floor, maybe even the moon overhead.
　Here, it was just red.
<Page21>
　A dull thud.
　The last one, perhaps, the humanoid, whose whole body was painted in cameltoe, was killed by her hand.
<Page22>
　With one hand. Carelessly. Without mercy. Like an ant.
　The dead man's head was grabbed by an invisible hand, crushed in the air, and blood and brain plasma were splattered on the wall like paint.
<Page23>
"Al---Quade."
　A world where even the moonlight is red.
　In the center of it, there was Alquade.
<Page24>
　I'm not sure if you're aware of this.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page25>
"-----"
　You can't call out.
　The creaking of the spine has reached its peak.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
<Page26>
　---- Gee, gee.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's not a good idea to stay here.
　I don't want to die yet, I'm screaming.
<Page27>
　It's too late for anything.
　Neither white nor red, I was a foreign object in this space.
　The white woman looks back.
　Like a single-eyed demon, the eyeball looks at you.
　---I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page28>
　It's not that our eyes met.
　It's just that I saw that "eye".
　Just by that.
　The blood in my body rushed, and the surface layer of reason disappeared.
<Page29>
　The first thing I felt was pure survival instinct.
　I shouldn't be here. I can't let them see that.
　I mustn't let it know. I must not be seen.
　We can't talk to each other. We can't coexist. We can't reach it.
　Tatakae nai. Nigaerarenai. Kanai kokonai.
　The point is. Whatever you do...#You.#Ha.#Tasukara nai.
<Page30>
　That's right. That creature's numbers are different.
　It's not that the level is high or low, but the standard of the level itself is too different from ours.
　Too different. Too different. Too different. That's why...
<Page31>
　All of our veins swell.
　At first, it was fear.
　What came next was a murderous intent akin to rapture.
<Page32>
　A lightning bolt in a clear sky. The clearest answer in human history.
　The cells rejoice at the arrival of an enlightenment comparable to that of an enlightened person.
　Because that thing shouldn't be there.
　It's something we don't need.
　So kill it. Kill it now. Kill it here. Kill it now.
　Put it in the pulse of my blood and get rid of it right now.
<Page33>
　My heart leaps.
　I know I can't win, but my whole body is screaming for me to kill it.
　What a contradiction.
　If you don't want to die, you want me to kill you?
　Do you want me to kill you if you want to be killed?
　Is killing the only thing stuck in this head?
<Page34>
"----, a"
　No. There's no ego here.
　Those eyes. You can't look into those golden eyes.
　You can't. There's no escaping her eyes.
　Boom, boom, boom, boom, and the blood boils.
　The irresistible rush of blood.
　But more than that, there is something that tries to break the shell of reason.
<Page35>
"A ----, a---"
　What is it that makes you want to kill?
　You don't want to die, so you kill them before they kill you?
　Die laughing. It's utterly stupid.
　You don't need a reason to want to kill.
　Come on, be honest, Tono Shiki.
　You should've killed that woman a long time ago.
<Page36>
"Don't..."
　No, it's this reason that should shut up.
　You're right.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page37>
"A ----- ah."
　Yes, I want everything.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I can't breathe. I can't stay conscious.
　Gold eyes wavering in a daze.
　It is...
Even if you kill it, you can't kill it.
<Page38>
"---Shiki......?"
　The woman's eyes return to red.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page39>
"You will be able to get a lot more out of it.
　You can find a lot more information on the web.
　It doesn't matter. You can get a knife and push down the woman's body.
　The woman's body has no strength. It is easy to hold them down.
　I get on top of her, put one arm around her neck, and swing the other arm with the knife high in the air.
<Page40>
　The rest.
　It's a great way to make sure you get the most out of your vacation.
<Page41>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page42>
　I'm sure you'll agree.
　---I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one.
<Page43>
"Shut up,......!"
　I'm not sure what to do.
　The woman raises her chin in agony.
　I ...... can't believe it.
　Such a strong life, but now I can't even shake off this one arm.
<Page44>
"Zhi---you."
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for a great deal more.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　The heart pulsates with the rush of blood.
<Page45>
"Haa--- haa ---- haa! ----!"
　Her breathing is disordered.
　I can't work my vision properly.
　My body seems to have turned into lava.
　It's hot, hot, hot, and I want to be released right now.
<Page46>
"Ha--- ha ---- ha! -----"
　I shift my body.
　Slide your hips on the woman's hara.
　Let Alcade's legs open and sink her body between them.
<Page47>
"Zhi ......貴......!"
　He stares at me anxiously.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it'll help.
<Page48>
"Haa---- haa---- haa. ----"
　Bloodshot. I feel like I'm going to faint.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't lose your mind.
<Page49>
　The cheeks with vermillion.
　A soft neck.
　The body of the woman who became under me, no more than this.
<Page50>
"Haa---haa---haa--! -"
　I can feel the movement.
"Haa--- haa--- haa-- -"
　Golden. Even my soul was about to be sucked in, eyes.
<Page51>
　The arm leaves the neck.
　As it is, I touched the woman's chest.
　I touched the body. I touched the legs.
　I crawled my fingers on the white belly and felt the body heat of the flesh.
<Page52>
"No..."
<Page53>
"No, no, no... this is not Shiki. .........!
　A feverish voice.
　The red eyes pleading.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page54>
"You can get a lot more information on the web.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　The woman desperately tries to push away with both hands.
　Grabbing both of its arms.
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
　Would it have been better if there had been a nail?
　The figure of the woman who was held down by both hands is like a sacrifice of the crucifixion.
　The eyes glare back at the man who leaned on it hatefully / obviously regretfully.
<Page55>
　That figure is even more glamorous.
　You can't use both of your arms either. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a good idea to have a little bit of fun.
　It's the antagonism that kills each other rather than rape that is appropriate for animals.
<Page56>
"I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it. -.
　One arm grabs the woman's white, white, white, white, beautiful throat.
　The only mouth that will be free will be the teeth on the woman's chest.
<Page57>
"You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to go about it.

"Oh ---- n ............!"
　This is a great way to get the most out of your money.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　I suddenly remembered that I was hungry.
　That's right. Her stomach had always been empty. I had always been hungry.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page59>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　The woman's arms are strengthened, but the appetite is stronger now.
　I'm sure you'll agree. You will find a lot of things to consider.
　It's the same as the meal you just had.
<Page60>
　It's a good idea to have a good time. Now I'm on the side of eating.
　There may be differences in life, but what we do biologically is the same.
　The blood sucking in the park, this foolish impulse, and the hamburger at noon are no different.
　We eat because we need to. We eat because it's fun.
　We eat because we want to. ---They devour each other because they love each other.
<Page61>
　That's all. That's all animals are.
　Resistance is inevitable.
　The two breasts rise and fall with a bang.
　There is the proof of a good shape and a sure woman there.
　In addition, it is possible to make use of a lot more than one of these.
<Page62>
"You can find a lot more information on the web.
　The woman's voice rises.
　It's a great way to make sure you get the most out of your vacation.
　It is not a problem.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page63>
"I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
　The woman's body temperature rises.

"-------!

"This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your time and money. This is not allowed,......, or else,......!
　A sorrowful voice.
　I don't know. I don't hear that.
　The knife goes up. The vermilion color blots the eyeball.
　---I want to kill myself so badly.
　I can't stop my own body.
<Page66>
"I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
　It's a regretful voice.
　In the event that you're in a position to, you'll be able to.

　But I'm crying.
　The one who smiles so straightforwardly that it can't be helped is crying.
　I can't believe it. I can't forgive it.
　If I were you, I would never, ever make you cry.
<Page69>
　A headache runs.
　I scream for you to run.
　My consciousness is dizzy with conflicting impulses.
　What do you want to do, you ask yourself at last.
　I think Alcade is -----
C:>I just want it.
C:>I can't do anything I don't want to.

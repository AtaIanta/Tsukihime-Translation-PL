　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.

　Like a stake through a vampire's chest.

"Ah -----"
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to make of ----.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　The last moment.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.

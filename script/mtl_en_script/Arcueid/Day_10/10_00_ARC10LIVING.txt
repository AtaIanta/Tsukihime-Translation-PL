　I dreamt I saw the moon.
　I can't remember where or why I was looking up at the moon.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page7>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　The midwinter temperature rushing through my veins.
　Alone in the dark, I feel dizzy.

"---Shiki-sama."
　...... In the morning light, I can hear the call of the jade.
<Page9>
"It's time for you to wake up.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.

"------"
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.

"I'm not sure what to say.　Are you feeling unwell?"

　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page14>
"It's a good morning, Jade.
　Thank you for coming to wake me up this morning.''
　As I raise my upper body from the bed, I smile as naturally as I can.
<Page15>
"I'm not sure what to do with it. I'm not sure what to do with it.
"I'm sure you'll agree that it's a great idea. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page16>
　That's what woke me up this morning.
　I got up from the bed.
　It was just before seven in the morning, ten minutes earlier than usual.
<Page17>
"Breakfast, right? I'll be right there, so you can go ahead.
"Yes, sir. I'll be waiting for you in the dining room.
　As usual, the jade bowed and quietly left the room ......#I'm sorry.
<Page18>
".................. Um, Shiki-sama."
"Hmm?　Is there anything else you want to tell me?
<Page19>
"............ No. No, nothing at all.
　I'm sure you'll have a great time.
<Page20>
　I'm not sure what to say.
　---I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's not so bad that I can't go to school.
　You can get back your strength by eating the breakfast that Amber made for you.
<Page21>
　In the living room, there was Akiba sitting on the sofa and Jade waiting by the wall.
<Page22>
"I'm sure you'll agree.
　Did you get a good night's rest last night?"
<Page23>
"I'm not sure. Good morning, Akiba.
　In the event that you have any kind of questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can contact us at our own web site.
　It's good for your mental health to be in a good mood, and I'm glad to hear that.
"What's wrong with you? Don't you have to change into your uniform?"
<Page24>
"Yes, we've decided to close the school for the day. I've got some work to do at the villa.
　Is your brother at school as usual?　Please, go ahead and enjoy being a student at your leisure."
<Page25>
"What?"
　You can see that he is in a good mood, but even so, the tension is strange, Akiba's guy .......
<Page26>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　I'm not sure if it's because I've had a good night's rest last night?
"Well, yeah. I was up early this morning. ......

"Hmm. Then you don't need to worry anymore.
　I'm glad you're a man who listens to me."

"I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to go to the cafeteria and get some breakfast.
　I'll go to school after I eat, so you don't have to worry about me.
"I understand. But if you still have any questions, please don't hesitate to drop by.
　I'll wait here for a little while longer."
<Page30>
　You will be able to find a lot more information on this website.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family.
<Page31>
　I finished my breakfast and left the house.
　It was a naive idea to think that breakfast would make you feel better, but I couldn't eat breakfast well to begin with.
　My appetite was not working at all.
　This is why it took me a good 30 minutes to have a leisurely breakfast, even for a student.
<Page32>
"Ugh ......, I'm sorry for not preparing a proper meal for you this morning .......
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, I will definitely prepare a breakfast that will scatter stars in Shiki-san's eyes,......!

"Oh my God. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　But you really should not overdo it, okay?
<Page40>
"It's ....... It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web.
"Yes. I'll be waiting for your return."
<Page41>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It is not the truth that came out of a lie, but let's come back without a detour today.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money to spend, you'll be able to take advantage of it.
<Page42>
　I headed to the school.
　My limbs are still heavy and I feel as if I am wearing someone else's body as I walk down the hill.
　The stagnation in my limbs, which I thought would soon recover, doesn't seem to be going away.
<Page43>
　　　　I reach the classroom.
　It was the middle of the second period.
　The teacher told me I was late, but I sat down in my seat.
　I leaned back in my chair and was finally able to do so.
<Page44>
　It was lunchtime.
　Arihiko seemed to be absent. The two absentees today were Arihiko Inui and Satsuki Yumizuka. I was concerned about the fact that Arihiko, but Yumizuka's absences continued.
　I hope it's a reason that everyone can agree on, that he or she caught a cold.
<Page45>
　By the way, what should I do during my lunch break?
　.............
　.............
　.............
　............ meal.
　Yes, if you don't take food, you can't cure what you can cure.
<Page46>
　But the appetite does not come at all.
　It's not that I don't feel good.
　I feel like I've lost the ability to function itself.
　So there is no need to eat, no reason to get up out of the chair, no energy to get up, no waste at all.
　The strange thing was that I was accepting these illusions without feeling uncomfortable.
<Page47>
　The class has started.
　What kind of class was it? I can't remember the subject of today's fifth period.
<Page48>
　Even when I look at the blackboard, even when I listen to the teacher's voice.
　I can't read the whole thing.
　The letters get mixed up like paint in water.
<Page49>
"Ugh. ............"
　I feel nauseous.
　The entire classroom is tilted.
　The balance is lost.
　You will fall down the slope. I try my best to hold on. But the world is uneven.
　Dazzled, my consciousness becomes sick.
<Page50>
　Without any resistance, I fell off the chair.
　There was an unpleasant sound, hard and heavy, as if a bowling ball had been dropped on the floor.
　A female student screamed.
　I hear the footsteps of a teacher running towards me.
<Page51>
　I...
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page52>
　...... After that, it was all routine.
　I fainted from anemia and was taken to the infirmary where I had to sleep in bed until I felt better.
　A little after seven in the evening, with a fever still near 38 degrees Celsius, the school nurse called Tono's house.
<Page53>
　The pickup came quickly.
　Shiki Tono was taken to Tono's residence instead of the hospital, witnessing a scene like in a movie: a black luxury car parked in the school parking lot.
<Page54>
　He only had a fever, so it was a natural#It was a natural treatment.
　I'm just as heavy as the rest of you, but my consciousness is clear.
<Page55>
　The black luxury car does not mix with the mundane world, and runs through the city at night indifferently.
　The only people in the car were myself and the driver.
　The driver did not speak a word.
　Tono Shiki is fixed in the back seat with a seatbelt.
　The outside air and the inside air are heavy and bitter.
This is like a hearse, isn't it?
　I thought of a joke, but I stopped myself from saying it.
<Page56>
　Through the arch of the dark trees, an old mansion appears.
　Oh," he said.
　A sigh of admiration or even resignation escaped me.
<Page57>
　This mansion has not changed at all since seven years ago.
　In a solid castle, there is always a prison.
　Terrible things. Evil things. Things that are different from common sense.
　Everything that deserves to be kept separate.
<Page58>
"Welcome home, Your Highness.#Shiki-sama.
　I heard what you said. I will take you to your bed immediately, so please be patient until then."
<Page59>
　A servant will meet you in the lobby.
　I managed to get in through the front door, but my knees wouldn't give in and I almost fell on the carpet.
<Page60>
"Look out ......!
　I beg your pardon. Please come this way. You still have a fever, don't you? It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
<Page61>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time and money.

　It is not your fault that Shiki-sama is prone to illness. It is okay for you to be pampered, Shiki-sama.
　Every human being wants to rely on and be relied on.
<Page64>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.

"...... I see. Then feel free."
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.

　...... I want to be relied on. I want to rely on you.
　...... I want to be protected. I want to protect you.
　...... I want to be kept alive. I want to live.

　I see.
　Although they are opposite orientations, they are by no means two opposites.
　It is certainly a desire that everyone has at the same time.
<Page68>
"We are going up the stairs, so please be careful."
　The servant pulls back his hand and begins to walk.
　You can find a lot more information on the web at .......
　In the event that you're not sure what to do, you'll be able to find out how to do it.
<Page69>
"You'll be able to get a lot more than just a few.
　It's different here. The direction is different.
　The next step is the east wing. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　Beyond this...
　This way is...
<Page70>
"This is different."
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　It's not only that, but also the touch of a sweet hand, and even the servant's clothes that should be familiar by now, are gone.
<Page71>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.

　There is no sense of touch.
　You will find that there is
<Page72>
　No entrance, no exit.
　It was just a giant drawer where I keep all my junk.
　I was in a huge drawer.
<Page73>
"Oh..."
　I fall down as if collapsing.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　Because there is no more touch of skin, the truth is probably not known until the next time you wake up.
<Page74>
　The end without any explanation.
　The end of the story is unclear, and no reason is revealed.
　It is abrupt, but this is also a Tono Shiki-like ending.

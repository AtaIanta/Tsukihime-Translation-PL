"'...... Akiba is at school.
　Amber is away on a shopping trip, and Jade is cleaning on the ground floor. ......
<Page2>
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual products and services that are available.
　It's not that big of a deal to go into your father's room.
<Page3>
　The room at the end of the hallway was locked.
　It's a good idea to take off your glasses and cut the "line" on the key.
<Page4>
　There is no going back now,.......
　It's a great way to make sure you don't get caught in the middle of the action.
<Page5>
"What is this room ...... too dark?
　Even with the curtains closed, it is not as dark as this.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page6>
　It is possible that by pressing the switch, the outside world will know that someone is in the house.
　I know I'm being overly cautious, but I'll just use the light from my phone to illuminate the room.
<Page7>
"It's ....... It's more tidy than I thought it would be."
　The interior of the room is the same size as the office used by Akiha.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page8>
　The bookshelf is also kept as it was before his death.
　So, the question that remains is how dark it is.
　I'm not sure what's going on with the curtains.
<Page9>
"------.
What?"
　---there.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page10>
"...... iron ...... grid ......?　Why ......?"
　I can't believe it.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　The window of Makihisa's room was a full wall.
<Page11>
　It's not just the blackout curtains that kill the sunshine.
　The window had a sturdy iron grate hammered into it on one side.
　It's as if they're trying to stop something from coming in from the outside.
　Or.
　It's as if they're trying to keep people in.
<Page12>
".................."
　This is not good.
　I don't know what this darkness shows, but I do know that this is a cage of secrets ...... madness that I must not see.
<Page13>
　I have to get out of this room now.
　No one else must ...... know that I'm here, not even Akiha or Amber.
<Page14>
　If they do know, then--
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page15>
"I'm not sure what I'm doing here.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a bookcase.
<Page16>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's not that there's any purpose to it, but it's the fact that Makihisa is so meticulous.
　It might contain documents about Akiba, me, or the company.
<Page17>
　There was nothing in the drawer of the desk.
　However, up to the second unlocked drawer.
　The third drawer has a lock on it.
　It seems that after my father's death, no one has been able to open it and it has been left unattended.
"............"
　I take off my glasses again and "kill" the lock.
<Page18>
"...... book?　A diary, this?"
　Inside was a bundle of old papers and a thick diary.
　The paper seems to be a ...... family tree of the Tono family.
<Page19>
"You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　There is no doubt about it.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your money.
　There are, but---
<Page20>
"...... what's this. Makihisa's guy adopted a child nine years ago. You can find a lot more information on the web at ......, but you'll soon die of illness.
<Page21>
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but it's a good idea.
　...... could it be a concubine's child, a ...... who was surrounded outside?
　That earnest Makihisa?
<Page22>
"I'm sure you're not the only one. ......
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why. In the event that you have any questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　---- No, wait.
　This is not right, no matter how much.
<Page23>
　Look through the family tree again.
　It's not a ...... mistake.
　All of the people in the Tono family died in unusual ways.
　Suicide. Accidents. Other deaths. Missing in action.
　Not one ...... of them has lived out their lives in peace.
<Page24>
"............"
　The series of records can only be described as cursed.
　What's unusual is that the majority of deaths are suicides.
　The heads of the Tono family took their own lives either before or after reaching adulthood.
<Page25>
　The light fades from my vision.
　It feels like blood is pooling in the back of my head.
　My limbs lose strength, and my breathing becomes more and more choked.
　As if to escape the dizziness and the bad feeling, I turn to my diary.
　I turn the page. The date at the beginning is 2004.
　This is the year in which someone adopted by ...... Makihisa died of an unknown illness.
<Page26>
　I'm going to follow the words written in the diary.
　It's the kind of neat but nervous handwriting that is typical of Makihisa.
　I read out the day's contents as if buoyed by a fever.
<Page27>
"...... Tono's clan is cursed.
　Since the move to modern times, every child born has a separate genetic ...... heritage from the ......".
<Page28>
　It's ten years old. The ink is so faded that I can't read it well.
<Page29>
"It's a great way to get to know your family and friends.
　In Akihabara, you can see a special ...... strong ....... It's sad to think about my child's future. ............ According to the doctor who introduced me, if you educate your child strictly from an early age, the expression will ...... ..."
<Page30>
"I can't tell ...... Akiha that she needs another surgery tonight. ...... That girl will hate me. I'm not sure what to make of it. It's all Tono's .............
　But I am relieved. No matter how close ...... Akiha is to the blood of ......, compared to that brother, Akiha is far more human.
<Page31>
　What ...... is this?
　Tono's clan is cursed ......?
　Segregation?　Did they perform surgery on Akiha?
　And --- who's that last line about?
　That brother. That brother. That brother.
　No matter how you look at it, it's about me...
<Page32>
"Hello, Shiki."
　...... belly, hot ......?
　You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page33>
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your money.
　In addition, the sense of touch that is lost from the toes.
　My body collapses as if leaning against the desk, and my outstretched hands lose their footing as I fall to the ground from my back.
<Page34>
"The diary is not good. After all, it hasn't been censored yet. I don't even plan on you seeing it."
"....................."
　My mind wanders.
　That man was...
<Page35>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one who's had a bit of trouble with the inexperienced head honcho.
　I don't know how, but it's your misfortune that you got the key."
<Page36>
　...... I realized that my breathing had long since stopped.
　The death rays and headaches that were so certain are now lost.
　...... So.
　It's not until you've done this that you realize.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page37>
　Because without it, you can not wake up forever.
　The body of the originally dead body of Tono Shiki, as it is, will fall into a sleep that will not wake up ...

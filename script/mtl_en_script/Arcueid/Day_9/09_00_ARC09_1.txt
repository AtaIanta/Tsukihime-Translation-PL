　---White.
　　　　The white color evokes nostalgic memories.
　　　　What I had forgotten.#　　　　What I had to forget.
　　　　What my father ordered me to forget.
<Page2>
　A hot summer day.
　Blue sky and a big, big cloud.
　The slowly wavering landscape
　And the faint sound of cicadas.
　The sound of cicadas.
<Page3>
　mmm mmm mmm
　mmm mmm mmm mmm
　Mmm, mmm, mmm
　It's so loud it makes me want to die.
　In the square are the husks of cicadas.
　The sun seems to be right beside me.
　The square is gradually burning.
<Page4>
　A hot day in the middle of summer.
　It's as if the world has turned into a frying pan.
　Een, een, een
　Enn Enn
　Een, een, een...
mmm
　Akiha is crying.
　Akiha, who's always been quiet and always followed me...
　She's crying like a baby.
<Page5>
　In the square, a child is lying alone.
　The white shirt is dyed bright red, and does not move even a little.
　I'm looking down at it.
　My hands are as red as the fallen child's.
　No, no.
　These two hands are red with the blood of the fallen child.
<Page6>
"■■-----!"
　The adults come over.
　They notice this tragedy and come over with blood.
<Page7>
"What a mess. -----
　The adults take Akiha with them.
　The fallen child remains dead.
　In the distance, there are white, white, white clouds in the sky.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page8>
"Did you kill him?" ----
　The adults are shouting.
　They are shouting the name of me who killed a child.
　They are shouting the words of only two letters as if they were mad.
　Just two words.
　The adults all called me Shiki and held me down, my hands dyed bright red.
<Page9>
　I still don't understand why.
　Killing things that can be killed.
　Killing things that are alive.
　What the hell was wrong with that?
<Page10>
　Open the eye lid that was blocked.
　I think I saw a nostalgic dream that I don't understand the meaning of well.
<Page11>
"..............."
　I'm in my room.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page12>
　My brain is still not working.
　The events of last night come back to me in a jumbled mess.
　Everything is so impossible that I can't sort it out, but if I had to think of one thing in particular, it would be.
C:>It's Alcade.
C:>It's about the Man in Black.
C:>It's about Dr. Noel .......

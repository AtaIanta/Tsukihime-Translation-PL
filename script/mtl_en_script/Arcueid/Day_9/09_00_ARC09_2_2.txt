"I'm sure you're right. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. I'm not a neat freak by any means.
"I don't know.　Shiki-san's room is very clean.
<Page10>
"It's just that I don't have many belongings. Well, it's just a coincidence.
<Page11>
"I'm not sure what to do with it. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.

　When you were left at Arima's house, Makihisa-sama took away your personal belongings,......?

"What?　I've been doing this for a long time. You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　But I don't remember what happened before or after the accident, so I don't know what happened then.
<Page15>
　I remember the time when I was alone in the hospital room.
　No one showed up to visit me, and I ran out of the hospital room, terrified that I would see the line of death.
　It was because of this that I was able to meet the doctor, and as a result, I can say that I was more than lucky.

　I would like to thank the doctors who saved Tono Shiki's life and the nurses who took care of him with kindness.
<Page21>
"I'm sorry, I got carried away.
　I'll be back soon, so please be quiet, okay?　In the event that you've got a lot more than one of these, you'll be able to get a lot more.
<Page22>
　Leaving a starry smile, Amber went to get a poultice.

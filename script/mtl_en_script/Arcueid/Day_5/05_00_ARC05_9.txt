"------"
　The cold air that cuts the skin.
　It's a great idea.
　It is extremely cold and difficult to even just live.
　As if pressurized inside the skull, the brain is raising a creak.
<Page2>
　I predict the end of two minutes later, and scratch my heart, which is about to burst.
<Page3>
　The corpses swarming Alcade.
　A procession reminiscent of midsummer in the extreme cold.
　It is the ant itself which hangs on sugar under the hot sun.
　Alcuade is killed.
　A limb is stripped by those corpses, and it is dismantled and offered like I / you did.
<Page4>
　And I'm watching it from a safe distance.
　Just like that.#Like this?
<Page5>
"I can't.
　That thing was just a disaster in the form of a human being.
　You should not have cornered it.
　The idea of defeating it was a bit of hubris.
<Page6>
　No more killing anyone?
　Solve the problem with no more casualties?
　How foolish. I had to let that monster go. We shouldn't have confronted it. We had to wait for it to pass us by like a typhoon. If we had done that, at least the city would have burned.
<Page7>
"------, but it's impossible."
　Someone who could do nothing. I'm not going to do anything.
　Someone who didn't even have a weapon. I have a weapon.
　In the pressurized brain, common sense and insanity flail about.
　Consciousness turns to the rear to escape. There is myself who cannot be stopped.
　It can't be helped. What can I do against that thing? That woman. This much is enough. It's too much from here on. That woman. All you have to do is run away. Just turn your back on it. That's what decent people do. That woman is going to be killed.
<Page8>
　I look up at the sky. In my field of vision, there are frozen buildings.
　The people who died in an instant. They wouldn't even have time to scream.
　The scene at the hotel last night. I think back to the pleas of the people who were killed for no reason.
　The sight of the fallen woman. The corpse which drools sloppily and rubs up against a woman. The river of ice which spreads. In spite of it, that vampire observes the death of the town indifferently even now.
<Page9>
"------ no doubt."
　The skull cracks. In this low temperature, the heart is pumping out blood like a raging bull.
　It's like...
<Page10>
"------ I can't do this."
　The fear running down my spine has all been translated into anger.
　It's defective. It's a comedy. I'm too immature to be human.#Because.#I don't have the capacity or the judgment to stand by and watch this happen...!
<Page11>
　I take off my glasses.
　I desperately cover the trembling that rises from my mouth with my left hand and the body heat that is being expelled.
<Page12>
　One minute, no, three minutes.
　That's all the time I have to be active.
　It's not a matter of mental strength. In that underground, that is the limit of human life activity.
<Page13>
"Fuck... fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
　What am I doing...!
<Page14>
　He descends the slope, torturing himself.
　It's ridiculous. I was ridiculous. I was really ridiculous.
<Page15>
　Do not want to die, so you run away?
　It's the opposite. If that was the reason, it was exactly the opposite.
　It was something that should not be tolerated.
　It's something that can't be allowed to go unchecked.
　If you run, you will surely die. Not only you, but this whole town.
<Page16>
　Then the action to take was obvious.
　If you don't want to die, kill it. Run to stay alive.
　Kill that thing here and now, even if it's just for a second.
<Page17>
　I had reached the end of my patience.
　You unabashedly killed, robbed, and survived.
　I can't tolerate them as different creatures, as the same life.
　Whatever it is, if it's alive, it's my prey.
　Here, I'll stop his lifeblood. ......!
<Page18>
　I run towards Alcade.
　The corpses are trying to sink their teeth into the woman's body.
<Page19>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　Can you kill something that looks like a person, whether it's human or not?
<Page20>
　---It doesn't matter.
　Right now, I just have a headache.
　This is the first time I've exposed my naked eyes for this long.
　It's the first time I've moved with objective thinking this far.
　I've never been so manic, looking down the line of death.
　I commit to memory the image of the corpse to be killed.
　Don't touch it. It's an eyesore. Don't let the dead eat the living.
　In the first place...
　Don't let any creature but me prey on that woman.
<Page21>
　I'm going to break the line between the three bodies.
　Divide each torso into three. The corpses will be split like butter and killed.
　It's that simple. Because their consciousness was focused on Alcade. It's not like they were defenseless.
<Page22>
"Wake up!　How long have you been asleep ......!"
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page23>
"I'm sure you're not the only one.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family.
<Page24>
"This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your vacation.　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page25>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
　I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to do.
<Page26>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's not me who should run away, it's him, but unfortunately, I can't afford to let that happen.
<Page27>
"Okay, you're fine. That's fine. Cover for me if you can."
"I'm sure you're not the only one.　I mean, are you insane?
"You can't be serious.
　Look, I'm at the bottom of the ocean, and I've got three minutes. So in that time...
<Page28>
"This time. Me and you, we're gonna kill him and end this.
<Page29>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to get to know a person. He has not seen me yet.
<Page30>
　---Three seconds to go.
　I'm not going to wait and see. I'm going to finish him with one blow.
　My body's already been altered.
<Page31>
　You have three minutes before your consciousness and body are shut down by the cold.
　That's less than a minute to be fully active.
　That's enough. I know what I have to do.
　I can see the line of death that will kill the monster.
<Page32>
　Finally, he reacts.
　With a swatting motion, he turns his gaze to intercept me.
　The giant spear that skewered Alcade is gone.
　It's only natural. I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page33>
　To Vrouve, I'm no different than the corpses.
　He treats me like an incompetent "thing" that only protects Alcade.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page34>
"------ Ha.
　This is why you have a chance to win.
　The only thing I can do is surprise him.
　They've seen you. You can't attack them from behind.
<Page35>
　But I can take him by surprise.
　He doesn't know about my eyes.
　He doesn't even consider that a mere human has the means to kill an immortal vampire with a single blow.
<Page36>
　Two seconds.
　You only have to risk it once, to cross the line between life and death.
　We duck his first move. That's all he cares about.
　If we can just get through that gamble, all we have to do is break that line...
<Page37>
"...!"
　The last second.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　I'm not sure what to do with it.
<Page38>
　There were two reasons.
　One, I made a bad choice.
　I can't get into his pocket. The cold wave is blowing around him. The closer I get, the slower my body becomes. At the speed I'm running, when I get within two meters of him, I'm one step too far and lose consciousness.
　The minimum requirement for a surprise attack.
　You can't get close enough to him to kill him, but you can't get close enough to him to kill him.
<Page39>
　That's fine. As a matter of fact, I had taken that possibility into consideration.
　However, there is another problem.
　This one is too deadly.
<Page40>
"Bastard---!"
　Personal rage mixed with the headache arising from naked eyes.
<Page41>
　Unbelievable. That bastard, he read through the thing.
　Probably a hunch.
　More insight into death than the beast.
　He jumped back without a second's hesitation because he had a gut feeling that his enemy had the means to kill him, shuddered, and recognized me as a threat in a situation he had no reason to ......!
<Page42>
"...... Why did I retreat ......?"
　My retreat was a mere two meters.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us. I'm still laughing at the difference in life specs.
<Page43>
"It's ....... What are you, ......?"
"------."
　That's what I'm talking about.
<Page44>
　The situation is terrible anyway. The distance between us is unbridgeable.
　I admit it's impossible to beat him.
　He's figured out that I have a way to kill him.
　From here on out, there's no question.
<Page45>
"......." Stay away from me. You're gonna die out there."
　It'll be a one-sided slaughter from a distance.

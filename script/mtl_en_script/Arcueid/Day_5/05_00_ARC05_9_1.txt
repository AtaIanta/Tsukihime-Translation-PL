　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page2>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's simple. If my legs can't get me there, I'll rely on something else: ......!
<Page3>
　I'll run to Alcade in the rear.
"Shiki---!"
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　In the event that you're looking for the best way to get the most out of your business, then you're in the right place.
<Page4>
"I'm not sure what to do.　You'll only have one target!''
<Page5>
　It's a good idea for Vlove to have a group of prey.
　It's a good thing I'm not the only one.
<Page6>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
"What?
<Page7>
　I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page8>
"I'm sure you'll understand what I'm talking about.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
"Normally, yes!　But you can get anything you want out of it, you know!
"Yeah, I can, but..."
<Page9>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to do with it.
　If possible, three shots should be thrown at the rubble.
<Page10>
　The first shot is aimed directly at Vrouve.
　The first one is aimed directly at Vlaove, the second one is deliberately aimed off and behind Vlaove, and the third one is aimed again at Vlaove.
　And the third one is aimed at Vrouve again.
<Page11>
　It's the second one that I'm hiding in.
　Just before falling to the ground, I will cut and dismantle the line running through the rubble and get behind Vrouve within two seconds: ......!
<Page12>
"I'm not sure if that's really a good idea.
　If you miss the timing, you'll end up with a dead body?
"If I miss. Hopefully, it's the only way to kill him unharmed."
<Page13>
　The sweep of the ice spear is gaining momentum.
　You can't spend any more time here.
<Page14>
"I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to make of this.
"I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to do.
<Page15>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page16>
　The green ivy that appears from Alcade's fingertips binds me to the rubble.
　The thighs of both legs and my left hand are pinned to the rubble. Only my right hand, holding a knife, is free.
<Page17>
"Fifty meters to Vlove.
　Because the earlier one was like that---"
<Page18>
　Alcade uses both hands to lift up the rubble that's just rubble and the rubble I'm hiding behind.
"'Yeah, hold on for four seconds!
<Page19>
　A ton of rock running through the air.
　Three seconds later.
　As if to twist the stall caused by air resistance with force, the first throw flew at Vroove's head and
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page20>
　But it is not over for nothing.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to do with it.
<Page21>
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it'll help.
<Page22>
　Dismantle the rubble.
　Inertia stops.
　My arms and legs become free.
　I suck on the ground like a lizard.
　The body temperature and blood freeze in this instant.
<Page23>
"---Huh."
　I can see Vroove's back.
　The distance is four meters. I'm not sure what to do.
<Page24>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　One second passed. One meter left.
　If you take two more steps, you can reach the line that will end his life.
<Page25>
　But.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page26>
"------"
　I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your time with your family.
　It's not that I'm not a good person.
　There were countless thorns of ice growing around Vrove to greet the attackers.
<Page27>
"---You foolishly picked up the safety."
　A disappointed voice arrives.
　I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to do.
　I thought of a way to save myself.
　Alcade, out of concern for me, held back a second, slower than the other throws.
　I ...... failed. It's not as if I'm shallow.
　This is not a surprise attack or anything like that.
<Page28>
　You don't need to wait to bleed to death.
　My heart was completely stopped from the cold wave that affected Vlove and my disappointment in myself.

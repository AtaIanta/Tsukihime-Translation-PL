"I'm not sure what to make of it. ...... Well, it's not a mistake.
　It's a good idea to get a pair. Two women or a man and a woman.
"That's great, nerds are welcome!
　I've had no challengers lately, so I'm stuck!　If we don't get any money, we'll get killed, too!
<Page2>
　The man called Hal comes up behind me, laughing.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't miss out on anything.
<Page3>
"I'm not sure what to make of that.
　I'll take you to your part-time job."
　The man called Hal pushes the button of the elevator.
<Page4>
　This is the only place where electricity is available.
　This is the only place that seems to have electricity.
<Page5>
"Come in.
"............
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time with us.
　It's a very good idea to have a look at the website.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
<Page6>
　...... Let's be cautious.
　Here are a few things to consider
1. ask for more information.　I'm going to decline.
"......!"
　A sudden shock knocked me unconscious.
　The hypothalamus of the brain malfunctioned.
　The autonomic nerves that control the limbs are disconnected.
<Page7>
"I'm sorry.　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to make of that. ......
　I was hit in the back of the head with something that looked like a baseball bat.
<Page8>
"It's a pain in the ass.
　Don't come this far and get chickened out, damn it."
<Page9>
　The ...... elevator is descending.
　In a daze of consciousness, you can see the "B1" button glowing.
　You are taken to the B1...... B1...... basement floor...... basement, parking garage?
<Page10>
　...... Damn it.
　I'm conscious, but my vision is blurry.
　My arms and legs are flapping up and down, even though I didn't give any such orders.
　I fall down and feel a slimy, uncanny sensation on my face.
<Page11>
　As the elevator opens, it is illuminated by an intense light.
　The light is so bright I can't see what's going on outside.
"I'll get you down. Give me a hand."
"Oh no, you're going straight to M, not P!　I'm not going to let you get away with this!
<Page12>
　The ...... duo lifted my body and carried me out of the elevator and placed me on the floor.
　I thought they were going to toss me, but they were strangely careful there.
<Page13>
　The ...... sound of footsteps moved away.
　The ...... duo took the elevator and left the place.
<Page14>
"----, ------.
　Whatever it was, it was saved.
　There is still life. It's a serious wound, but not fatal.
<Page15>
　You will be able to find out where you are, but in a few more minutes, the paralysis in your limbs will subside and you will be able to move.
　Then we can fight back.
<Page16>
　Next time, we'll be on our guard. I've got one of those two guys, and now I'm going to find out what's going on...
<Page17>
"What?"
　The only consciousness that was still alive froze.
<Page18>
　What is this place?
　　　　　---The air is like a mucous membrane.
　What is this place?
　　　　　---The smell of fat, meat, and blood.
　What is this place?
　　　　　---A number of iron bars and a living corpse.
　What the hell is this place ......?
<Page19>
　It's not an underground parking garage.
　It's not anywhere above ground.
　There's no way this kind of manure dump is in our city.
<Page20>
"Huh..."
　Something's coming. I hear a lot of footsteps.
　I have a headache.
　I feel nauseous.
　The sound of footsteps approaching.
　My instincts scream that I will only be attacked if I stay here.
<Page21>
"Oh, my..."
　My legs still don't move.
　You will find a lot of things coming, dragging the rotten flesh with them.
"Ahhhh---!"
　It doesn't move. It doesn't move.
　Even if you put all your energy into crying, both legs do not move even a little!
<Page22>
"Ah, ah, ah...!"
　Crawl on the floor covered in blood and shit with your hands.
　It's not important anymore, it doesn't matter.
　I'm going to have to get out of here as soon as possible.
　It's a good idea.
　If you want to get back to your original world, you should go back to the elevator.
<Page23>
　I have to hurry.
　We have to hurry.
　Hurry, hurry, hurry.
　We'll make it.
　I'm sure I can make it.
　To the elevator. To the elevator.
　If I could just reach the elevator, the one that was stopped in midair like a gondola...

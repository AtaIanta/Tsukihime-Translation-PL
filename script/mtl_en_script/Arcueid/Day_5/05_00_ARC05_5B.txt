　It is truly a human missile.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page2>
　No, to be precise, it flew.
　Then it aimed and angled in the air and accelerated like a missile.
<Page3>
　Earth, sand, and debris erupted.
　The wind that arose swept away the surroundings, raising dust.
　The river of flames that was spreading throughout the downtown area was halted by that one blow.
<Page4>
　The policemen who had surrounded Vlove in the distance were blown away and most of them were out of action. They were divided into two groups: those who had been hit on the head and were in a coma, and those who had lost their will to fight because of the sudden bombing.
　It's no wonder.
<Page5>
"S...S..."
　After all, this is what happens when the dust clears.
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page6>
It seems that this is what they meant by "dropping down".
　The depth of the subsidence was more than 40 meters.
<Page7>
　I feel like I've seen the magnificent workings of nature. It's the same level of grandeur as the Amazon jungle or Niagara Falls.
"Cut it some slack, you bastard!"
　Of course, I'm not praising him in the slightest.
<Page8>
"Oh, but it's fucking awesome, coincidence or calculation?"
　As far as I can see from the rooftop, there are no casualties.
　The policeman who was out of shock treated the comatose policeman and retreated from the hypocenter to escape.
<Page9>
　As a result, this whole area became completely uninhabited.
　What a--- what a forceful manhandling ......!
<Page10>
"............!"
　Was that Vroove's flame?
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page11>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　In the dust, a white shadow was challenging the source of the flame.
<Page12>
"Follow me properly after---"
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　...... Thinking about this and that is for later.
　Now we must hurry down to the ground,......!
<Page13>
"Ha, ha, ha, ha---!"
　Run down the stairs.
　The key to the door that locked the rooftop was cut with a knife.
<Page14>
"...... Ha, ha, ha---ah."
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page15>
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　That's where I come in.
　All I have to do is run up to him, cut the line, and dismantle it.
<Page16>
　That was a hell of a drop by Alcade just now.
　It's only because he said he could suppress Vroob.
　But...
<Page17>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　...... Still, Vrouve was alive and well.
　It's also a great way to get the most out of your business.
　If not, Alquade has the handicap of a wound.
<Page18>
　In the worst case scenario, ......, I'll be able to take Vrouve by myself...
　No, it doesn't.
　We don't assume the worst. It's not that we didn't think about it, it's that we didn't need to think about it.
<Page19>
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you're going to need to be able to pay for it.
<Page20>
"Ha ----- ah."
　I've reached the elevator.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's not the time to get lost in the first place.
　I'll take a deep breath. I check my body. For now, it's working properly.
<Page21>
　However, the fingertips that hold the knife are frozen in place, as if they were not my body at all.
<Page22>
"------"
　Is this fear?
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　If that's the case, there's no problem.
　It is normal for people to be afraid of them. The other party that is killed just by approaching is faced. How can you be a decent human being without fear?
<Page23>
　So.
　If there's a problem, it's...
<Page24>
"------"
　...... it is.
　Only if you're more afraid of killing than of being killed.
<Page25>
"It's ----."
　Breathing faster.
　My heart is racing like it's a different part of my body.
<Page26>
　I arrived at the ...... ground floor.
　I grabbed my knife back and started running to the freshly made bombing site.

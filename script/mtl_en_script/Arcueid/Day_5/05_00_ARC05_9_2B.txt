　He bends down in front of Alcade.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page2>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page3>
　It was an upheaval of the earth itself, reminiscent of an explosion.
　A power move of wood chips. If Vroob's cold air is a snowstorm, then Alcade's act is a tsunami of earth.
<Page4>
　A flying spear of ice is nothing but a spray in front of this wall of earth and sand.
　Fifty meters high, the equivalent of 7,000 tons of mass rushes in to swallow Vrove.
<Page5>
　However, the knight is unmoved by the natural disaster that returns the earth.
　They pierce the massive wave of dust and sand with a single stab of their steel spears and push it back.
<Page6>
　In the downpour of debris, Vroove was visible.
　In the event that you've got a lot of time, you'll be able to take a look at a few of the best ways to make the most of your time.
<Page7>
　In the face of the towering wave, Sole regained his former thoughts.
　No, more precisely, from two minutes ago.
　The brain that was supposed to have been invaded by the constant cold wave and lost its sanity had been trying to operate normally since that moment when it had jumped back from the human that was right in front of it.
<Page8>
"That human is prepared to kill me."
"I don't know the logic behind it, but I'm sure of it."
　A residue from when he was once normal.
　The experience of struggle as a knight cultivated in the dark days of the Middle Ages beat away the curse that circled his whole body.
　The pride of only about twenty years had defeated the madness of over a thousand years.
<Page9>
　He knows very well what kind of miracle that is.
　This is just a moment. It's just a blink of an eye until he kills that person. It's an afterlife dream that can never happen.
　In a few seconds, the human joy of fighting will be frozen.
<Page10>
"------, c".
　This is why you can't help but get excited about this development.
　The aim of the enemy is obvious.
　It's a good idea to use this earth and sand as a shield as the enemy approaches.
　The enemy's weapon is cutting. This wall is also like a door for him. He will cut through it and step into the gap between us.
<Page11>
　I hold up my spear.
　I understand that originally I should crush the enemy hiding behind it with this huge wave.
<Page12>
　There is no need to respond to the enemy's methods of warfare.
　It is his method of warfare to crush the enemy's methods.
　He still has a lot of energy left in him.
　He has a stock of the finest blood, enough for 10 people.
　But...
<Page13>
""That, I can't do. I can never consume this soul."
　Warmth for him. Blood to burn, to be preserved forever.
<Page14>
　I don't mean to insult the human.
　I already understand that it is a special case that cannot be named.
　He knows that the moment he is approached by that thing, it will be the end of him.
　Even so, there are some things that cannot be compromised.
<Page15>
"Crush!"
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page16>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's not enough. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　This is a blow that only secured your own safety. There is no way that the "enemy" will be hit by such a blow.
　It will surely come. No matter what the cost, they will come.
<Page17>
"But..."
　Sadly, that is the limit of human beings.
　You can't go through the rain of rubble with a human body.
　You can't even use the support of the True Ancestor Princess to your satisfaction.
<Page18>
　If this downpour stops, that will be the end.
　As long as we can see her, we will never allow such a surprise attack again...
<Page19>
""------""
　The two eyes that perceive a thousand miles ahead are opened.
　---I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page20>
　It's not even a shadow running away.
　It's a great way to make sure you get the most out of your vacation. No way. It's not just the enemy, and I blame myself for that.
　If anything, a stronger chill of death is running down his spine.
<Page21>
　In just one second, his thoughts left the "enemy".
　It is obvious that they are approaching.
　If you can't spot them, you're assuming the wrong thing.
　He read that this sediment would be used as a shield.
　But if it wasn't a shield...
<Page22>
""------ road, huh!""
　He looked up at the sky. His enemy is against the moonlight.
　There is a direct death magic eye that lights up blue like a ghost.
<Page23>
　The thing that Alcade flew is not only the rubble that swallows Vroove.
　The real deal is this rock formation.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page24>
　Thirty meters below the ground, a tsunami of earth and sand crushes.
　Him and me. The final void between us.
　I reconfirm my choice and its consequences.
<Page25>
　If I succeed, Tono Shiki will lose both his legs.
　Even if he survives here, he won't be able to walk for the rest of his life.
　I imagine that life clearly.
　---It doesn't matter. If it's the price of these two seconds, it's a satisfying ending.
<Page26>
　Only one second of searching.
　I respect your insight, but one second is too late.
<Page27>
I'm not sure what to do.　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
I'm not sure what to do.　I'm not sure what to say.
<Page28>
"You'll have to make a path for me.
<Page29>
　It's a great way to get to know a person's personality.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your day.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page30>
"Come on."
　Measure the average survival rate.
　Before you begin, determine that one point.
　The route has been decided.
　Only two seconds, 30 meters of one-way traffic.
"It's showtime, vampire."
<Page31>
　The glide fall begins.
　A slider for one breath, approaching death.
<Page32>
　At this point, I've abandoned my response.
　With my speed of thought, I can only make one decision per second.
　In the two seconds leading up to the fall, I focus all of my abilities on only two points.
<Page33>
　In this choice, every action is facing death.
　The point with the highest concentration of death, of all of them.
　Assume a moment where you cannot survive no matter what you do.
<Page34>
　We have decided that there are two minus points.
　Other than there, the survival rate is probably about 10%. We don't take that into account. If there is 10%, there is no problem.
<Page35>
　The problem is the zero point.
　It's the point of absolute death, where no matter what the human performance is, you can only die.
　That's where we pour all our abilities into, and raise the zero to one percent.
<Page36>
　In order to step over these two lethal points, we solidify our consciousness.
　There is no consciousness to allocate to other events.
　So now that it's starting to come down, I don't have the ability to think of a response.
<Page37>
　What if the negative doesn't stay in two places?
　I don't consider that. I don't have the capacity to go over three places of death. Then he wins. It's just that his abnormality is beyond my imagination.
<Page38>
　The ice spear folds up and rushes to the falling prey.
　It's like the jaws of a beast. It's terrifying, but it doesn't matter.
　You can find a lot of people who are interested in this.
　The interception that I was sure would come, and feared would be killed if it did, was...
<Page39>
　---Ten meters.
　The first lethal point.
　Sensation of limbs, fine adjustment of muscle power, rapid braking of the trunk and its return.
　The fall trajectory, which is essentially unchangeable, is changed after "seeing" its angle of fire. ......!
<Page40>
　The iron lump that passes right next to you.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
　One second left. I've won. He has no more means.
<Page41>
　I've decided that the second minus is 'that moment'.
　I have to deal with the impact of this fall and kill him before my body shatters.
　I don't know what happens after that. I'll just focus on piercing his line.
<Page42>
　So.
　If he makes one more move than I predict.
<Page43>
"------"
　No thinking. No need to duck. Even if I could change the point in the middle of the game, I don't have the time to do that.
　It's the reason I abandoned the thought.
　If I was going to die, I would have died when I started running.
　Good.
　Even if my brain is skewered here, I'm sure I won't notice it at all.
<Page44>
　---Second.
　The emergency law of minus 100 degrees Celsius stops the whole body.
　The instinct to prepare for landing.
　The reason to advocate the significance of life has already been left far above.
<Page45>
"Vrove......!"
　The kinetic energy from the thighs to the hips, the hips to the back, and the back muscles is transferred to the swing of the right hand holding the knife.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　In other words, it is a killing machine that works only with sensitivity. It is only the brain which catches a line that it swings.
<Page46>
　In the limit, I saw light.
　The will of the atom which whirls. The life of the fixed material.
　The "point of death" like a pit.
<Page47>
　The brain which abandoned thought understands by instinct.
　If it is said that the line is the death of the life activity, that is the death of the origin of existence.
　It is nothing but the end of the universe, the most horrible thing in this world, which "kills" any immortal or any monster with one stab.
<Page48>
　But I really don't care about such a discovery.
　My whole body shakes with a stronger emotion than that.
<Page49>
　The machete was held in Vlove's hand. I'm not sure what to make of it.
　In this phase. To a foul opponent like me.
<Page50>
"------"
　It's a real thing. I don't know what the standards are for vampires. I'm not interested in that. He's simply a killer par excellence.
<Page51>
　I can't help but hate him.
　If he were sane, if he were not a vampire, he would have been a knight to be jealous of.
　Even if he's not even a shadow of himself now.
<Page52>
　I'm not sure if I'll ever get the chance to see that weapon again.
　Like turning, dodging, twisting.
　My eyes line the middle of his.
<Page53>
　In an instant, the temperature switches to its normal level.
　The cold wave, far from a natural phenomenon, disappears with his life.
　In it.
"---what the hell is this?"
　The vampire's monologue.
<Page54>
"'...... do not know this wound. I cannot remember this loss.
　This --- the touch of an atmosphere that cannot be verbalized is something I lost one day."
<Page55>
　I don't know what he's talking about.
　I don't know what he's saying or where he's speaking.
　But the gentle voice was like a poet celebrating spring.
<Page56>
"Oh... I feel no pain, no cold wave.
　It's horrible, but I miss it.
　It's as if I've become a dead man."

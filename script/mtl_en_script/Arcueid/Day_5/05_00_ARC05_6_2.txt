　I can't go down with this.
　The underground is filled with blue flames.
<Page2>
　A tall vampire stands in the center of it.
　Vroob Arkhangelis.
　He was right in the middle of that bombing and didn't have a single scratch on him.
　If you measure it by the human scale, it is almost an immortal monster.
　And yet...
<Page3>
　There is a white shadow that tosses it from the front.
　A beautiful hunter gallops through the garden of debris flickering with flames.
<Page4>
　Of course, the white shadow is Alcade.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page5>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It looks like a long sword, but that blade is from a machete.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　With his legs alone, he closed in on Vroob, and
<Page6>
　It's also a great way to get the most out of your time and money. ......

"---" "---, ---, ---."
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page13>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　But there is a limit to what you can do.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page14>
　His body regenerated, but that was the best he could do.
　It's reasonable to assume that he spent most of his strength trying to revive himself, just like the Alcade who was killed by me.
<Page15>
　In fact, that's how Alquaid sees it.
　That's why he's keeping his distance with each strike.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page16>
　I'm not sure if you've heard of it or not, but I've heard of it.
　I'm not sure what to do.
"---No, that was---"
　An indescribable sense of discomfort.
　I'm not sure what to say. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.

　It's the fact that he's already completely seen through Alcade's speed and movements, and most importantly...
　He hasn't even shown his flaming hands yet. ......!
<Page20>
"Qu------aaaaaaaaaa！！！！！"
"---!"
<Page21>
　I'm not sure what to say.
　You can find a lot more than just a few of them.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page22>
　The underground arena has turned into a fire forest.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　And then.
<Page23>
　I'm not sure if you've ever heard of it, but I'm sure you have.
<Page24>
"Alquaid...!
　One moment.
　The battle was turned upside down in an instant.
<Page25>
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page26>
　I'm not sure what to make of it. You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing. There is no place to escape, the flames become a licking tongue and lick the prey.
　The white shadow burned away without a trace.
　---If that's what happened last night.
<Page27>
　The flame cracks.
　The white skirt fluttered.
　The sight was glued as if fascinated by the transformation of the appearance.
<Page28>
　She said.
"The countermeasure is ready. I'll remake my body in advance."
<Page29>
　The black and white battle costume that could not resist the flames of Vrove.
　Will that costume swallow the flames, or will she just become that way as a result of remaking her body?
<Page30>
　Either way, the flames can't get through to her now.
　Alcade's countermeasures are perfect.
　As soon as she found out that her opponent was a flame monster and escaped from that hotel, her victory was confirmed.
<Page31>
　A hand of flame is unleashed.
　Alcade's left hand is thrust out haphazardly.
　With a hair-raising motion, she caused the towering walls of flame on either side to dissipate.
<Page32>
　A wall of flames that obeys the white dress and hangs its head.
　Her golden hair runs like a meteor.
<Page33>
　The power of the claws that flew and swung down is not comparable to the past.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with us.
<Page34>
　The overwhelming difference in performance.
　It's no longer a battle.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't get caught in the middle of the action.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page35>
　It's a good idea to keep your eyes on the prize.
　I'm not sure what to do. In addition, there are no more resources here that can be extracted from humans.
　The only blood that remains is that which flows through his own body.
　That will be gone in a few more blows.
<Page36>
　In other words, we're bankrupt.
　If it loses the heat it needs to revive, it'll become a corpse.
<Page37>
"...Stop, stop, stop..."
　A begging for life without any pretense.
　It is like a child who is spoiled.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　The vampire wields the machete in a bullshit way to shake off the fear in front of him. I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page38>
"It's cold---it's cold---it's cold here--! -!"
　The vampire leaped while screaming.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea. No, he jumped up.
<Page39>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　Even a height of 40 meters is not enough to stop the vampire.
　It is probably a plan to replenish blood on the ground.
<Page40>
　The green ivy twines around its legs.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page41>
""A---a, a---!""
　A river of flame appears at Vroob's feet again.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　The ash is made a nursery, and new ivy is twined.
<Page42>
　No matter how many times it burns up, the fetters are not broken. It loops like a phoenix.
　Yes. If a vampire is immortal, the work of nature is also an eternal infinite cycle.
<Page43>
　That ivy is the crystal. You can't escape without the "fire" that burns up this planet.
　I'm not sure what to make of this. I'm sorry.
<Page44>
　---I'm not sure what to do.
　You can find a lot of people who are interested in this type of product.
<Page45>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　She judged that this was the end of the matter.
　I agree with her.
　There's no need to wait for Tono Shiki's cooperation. I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page46>
　Even though .......
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　There is something wrong with it.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page47>
　Vlove's complexion and suffering are now morbid.
　The world is different for one person in that scorching heat.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page48>
　...... I know that hand's eyes.
　Obsession and defense instinct.
　It is the victim's side while he is the perpetrator's side.
　So...
　------ I'm sure we're making a fatal mistake.
<Page49>
"You idiot ......, what are you thinking, I'm ......!"
　The victory of Alcade is unassailable.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page50>
　It's a great way to make sure you don't have to do anything else.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　Even though I know that, I...
C:>We have to see how the battle goes.
C:>Call off Alcade.

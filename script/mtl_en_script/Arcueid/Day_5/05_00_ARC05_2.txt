"It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page3>
"I don't know any vampires.
　I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one.
"...... Hmm. But he seemed to know you.
<Page4>
"I've never seen you before. It's a good idea to take a look at the actual vampires and also their own personalities. I'm not sure what to do. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　But I know their names and identities. I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page5>
"I'm sure Vrouve is the opposite, a newcomer who hasn't even been given a name yet. I'm sure you're not the only one.
<Page6>
"That word again? What's an ancestor?
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It has nothing to do with you.
"I'm sure it does. I'm not sure what you mean by that.
　I'm not sure.
<Page7>
"The lord of the castle is not necessarily the same as the founder.
　The more powerful the dead, the easier it is to become the lord of the castle, and the lord of the castle is like a local lord.
　It's a good idea to have a vampire in your life.
<Page8>
"The world of the dead is divided into twenty-seven powers. You can think of it as having twenty-seven countries.
　You can find a lot of different types of vampires in the world. I'm not sure if you've heard of it or not.
<Page9>
　You can find a lot more information at ....... I'm not sure what to make of that.
　I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.
<Page10>
"I'm not sure what to do. I'm sure you'll be fine.
<Page11>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　The Vroobs are still in their infancy, but to you humans, they're still a disaster.
<Page12>
"It's the same with the hotel yesterday. He only went from the ground floor to the top floor. He didn't want to kill humans, he didn't really care about them.
　But that's how people die. Because that flame is like a curse that is generated just by his presence."
<Page13>
"What the...?
　What is that?
　I'm not sure what to do.
　You don't care about people?
　Then what about the tragedy at the hotel?
"...... happened because we ran to the hotel?
<Page14>
"Yes. Vroob came because I was there.
　...... Alcade affirmed.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the web site and see if you can find anything that might help you.
<Page15>
"...............," he said.
　It is easy to denounce Alcade as "your fault". It's a great way to get the most out of your life. I'm sure you'll be able to understand why. It's the same monster as Vroob in that respect.
　It's ....... You will find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
<Page16>
"It's your fault." ......?
　Yeah, you're absolutely right.
　And the people in the hotel were caught up in the disaster that was Vrove.
　And Alcade is in this mess because of you.
　It's all my fault for killing her...
<Page17>
"Shiki. Don't make the same mistake again.
　It would be natural for the weaker creatures to disappear.
　Their deaths are the responsibility of the entire human species, which somehow evolved to be unable to defend itself.
　If a person kills another person, that is certainly a crime in human society. But this is part of natural selection between humans and non-humans. It's arrogant to think that you are personally responsible.
<Page18>
"Arrogant because ...... I'm ......?"
<Page19>
"Yeah. That's fine if you're representing humanity.
　Look, let's talk about the mountains.
　There was a community of predators there. Their diet included humans. Then one day, a group of humans, completely unaware of this fact, came and annihilated them all for their own consumption.
<Page20>
"Who is to blame in this case?
　Are they to blame for not being able to protect themselves from the humans?
　Or the humans who killed them all?
<Page21>
"It's...
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time.
　The place of sin. The weight of life. It's a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page22>
　...... She is saying this.
　There is no sin in humans or animals.
　It's just that in this natural world
　The only thing that is absolutely evil is a species that cannot sustain its own life in this natural world.
<Page23>
"...... But this is a human society.
　It's a human society. It's a human city.
　It's not about humans being too weak or vampires being too strong.
<Page24>
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your vacation.
　In the event that you're not sure what you're looking for, there are a few things you can do.
<Page25>
"...... So. I'm not sure what to say.
　You certainly can't be a murderer, can you?
"...... What's with that tone?
　You think I'm naive?
<Page26>
"That's not the point. So let's make it clear here.
　What are you going to do now, Shiki?
　Fight the vampires?　Or run away?
　Choose whichever you like. I won't force you anymore. My promise to you as a watchman was fulfilled one day yesterday."
<Page27>
　What do you want me to do, ......?
　I don't know.
<Page28>
"But you have to be prepared. I'm not sure if you've heard of it, but I'm sure you've heard of it.
　No matter how much the humans sacrifice, if you can't see it as something that has nothing to do with you, you will surely go bankrupt.
　If you think that's wrong, go back to the way you were yesterday. Because that is the most correct way of being a human being."

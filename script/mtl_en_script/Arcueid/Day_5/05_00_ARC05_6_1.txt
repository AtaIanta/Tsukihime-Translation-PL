　The enemy's location is clear.
　There's a Vrove down there that needs to be defeated.
　And Alcade, the man I promised to fight with.
<Page2>
　The battle between them has already begun.
　...... Don't worry. I'm not here to fight. It's the end of the line.
　When Alcade captures Vrove, he will approach him and break his line.
　To do that...
<Page3>
"Yes, this is no time to be scared. ......!
　I slid down the slope of rubble and descended to the sunken ground.
　You can find a lot more information on the web.
　It's not an intentional thing, but a reflexive way of protecting your life.

"---"
　I can't breathe.
　There is oxygen. This blue flame is like a curse, it is not actually burning material, the hotel battle has shown that.
<Page5>
　But it's still hot. If you just breathe normally, the hot air will burn your lungs to death.
<Page6>
　In front of you, you can see a white vampire and a vampire with a black cloak.
　Swords and swords that intersect.
　In this high temperature, Alcade is attacking Vroeve without fear.
<Page7>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
　The problem is...
<Page8>
"---, ------"
　I'm not sure how much longer my body can hold out.
　My body...#I'm already on fire.#That's what I'm saying.
<Page9>
　But strangely, I'm not in pain.
　I don't need to breathe to know what's going on.
　I keep my knife in my hand and wait for the moment when I will defeat Vroob.
　Like a sprinter waiting for the start signal.
　Or like a ghost that never moves anymore.
<Page10>
　I keep waiting.
　Keep waiting.
　It keeps waiting.
　Even if my eyeballs dry up, get smoked, and turn to ashes, I keep waiting.
　The moment does not come forever.
　Do not even notice that you are only a burned film.

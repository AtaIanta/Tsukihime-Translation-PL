　The city was in a frenzy.
　The streets were crowded with people.
　The fire in front of the station could be seen from here.
<Page2>
　The extraordinary news was repeated on the outdoor vision.
　The fire occurred near the north exit of Soya Station.
　The train service has been suspended, and people who were visiting the downtown area are running for their lives.
<Page3>
　An anchor reports the emergency news on an outdoor vision.
　An interview with a high school girl who has just escaped from the fire.
"It's hot, it's hot, hey, why is it so hot?"
"Yuka, my friend was eaten. My arm, too, I don't know."
"I'm moving even though I'm dead, I'm laughing even though I'm burning ......!"
　Her complaints are treated as delirium from extreme conditions.
<Page4>
　The fire was still spreading, and there were even calls to evacuate the neighborhood.
　Nevertheless, the main street was overflowing with people.
　They had come here out of curiosity, watching and filming the fire from afar, and forwarding the information to their closest friends.
<Page5>
"......!"
　The road to the station had already been blocked.
　Fire prevention ...... no, it's too early for that, and above all, there are too many people.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't get caught in the middle of the night.
<Page6>
"Damn ......!"
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
"I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page7>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page8>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what I'm going to do here.
<Page9>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　Alquaid looked up at the wall of the building.
<Page10>
"I'm not sure if I can do this.
　It's the first time the two of us have flown together, but at this height it should be no problem.
"What?"
<Page11>
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page12>
"I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page13>
"Uh..."
<Page14>
"Ugh!
<Page15>
"Aaaaahhhhhh!"
<Page16>
　It's flying in the sky.
　No, it's bouncing.
<Page17>
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　I'm not sure what to say, but I'm sure you'll understand.
<Page18>
"I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
　High ......!　It's scary,......!　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with your family.
<Page19>
"I don't know.　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
<Page20>
　While nodding his head at my scream, Alcade went on a further savage rampage.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. This is the reason why it's so important to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page21>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　My face tenses at the unprecedented experience.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page22>
　It's the roof of a high-rise building that overlooks the city.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page23>
"I'm not sure what to say...
<Page24>
　The rapid up and down movement is making my breathing uneven.
　I'm not sure what to do. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page25>
"Look. There it is."
What do you mean, "look?"
<Page26>
　I'm not sure what you're talking about.
　The weight of the heart that was rising was also forgotten in an instant.
<Page27>
　---It's on fire.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your vacation.
"------"
　The vision observes the tragedy more closely.
<Page28>
　The main street is wrapped in a red veil.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page29>
　It is truly a river of flames. In the midst of it, he is repeatedly eating. He is bathing in red blood to fill his stomach.
　There are several figures in front of him.
　It is the policemen who are making a siege.
　They held up their pistols and fired all at once.
<Page30>
"Don't..."
　But he doesn't move an inch.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　A lot more figures appeared from behind the monster.
<Page31>
　A burning corpse.
　Perhaps people who were alive just a few minutes ago. Things that have now become moving corpses.
　As if it begged for help.
　As if begging for help, it walked towards the officers firing...
<Page32>
"What the hell is that..."
　White emotions leaked from my throat.
　I lost the chance to even look away.
　The sense of urgency and mission that I had when I was running through the city has been bleached away.
　What was in the human's head now was pure awe.
<Page33>
　That is the true nature of vampires.
　They kill people just by being there.
　And now, the one we must defeat...
<Page34>
"...... aren't they, the Church?
　If you're so indiscriminate, they should have come by now,......, but they haven't been assigned to this country,......?
　In the event that you've got a lot of money to spend, you'll want to make sure that you're able to afford it.
<Page35>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　This guy seemed to be on the lookout for something different, different from me.
<Page36>
"Well, what should we do, Shiki?
　As you can see, Vroob is in that state. I'm not sure what to do with it.
<Page37>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web and also the internet.
　I'm not sure what to do.　Or---"
<Page38>
"Risk it all to save another human?" And.
　You know my answer, but Alcade is the last to confirm it.
　Besides, with all the willpower I could muster, I glared at him with a shudder.
<Page39>
"...... huh. Yeah, there's no change in policy, is there?
　You might not be able to say the same about Vrouve if this doesn't change your mind.
　But what are you going to do?
　I don't mind if we start like this.
<Page40>
　Start like this......?
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
<Page41>
"Can you handle that situation?
"Hopefully. I don't want to be seen.
"Please, ......!　Get him out of here right now! ......!
<Page42>
"Okay, I'll take him down to the bottom.
　There's something hollow under there.
<Page43>
　...... Wait. Down?　What do you mean "drop"?
　I'm not sure what to do.
　We need to get him off the streets as fast as possible. ......!
<Page44>
"But don't forget your promise. Make sure you follow me."
<Page45>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　I'm sure you'll agree.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page46>
　It was like a white flower dancing in the wind.
<Page47>
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'm not the only one.
　The chains of gravity are broken.
　The anchor of gravitation is rolled up.
　The thing which should fall rises gently.
　Or, like a sailing ship catching the wind, she plays with the night sky.
<Page48>
　There is nothing surprising about it.
　The incarnation is the infant of the planet and a copyist.
　All the fluctuations that occur on the surface of the earth are hers.
<Page49>
　The blessings of nature that nurture life
　And the fury of nature that crushes life.
　It is the natural right of her body.
<Page50>
"Alright..."
　The beautiful flower turns herself around to look up at the moon.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　The chains that had been untied and the anchors that had been coiled up struck the surface of the earth.
　A stone tower with fire sparks scattered below.
"----!"
<Page51>
　The flower that bloomed in the night sky becomes a falling star.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.

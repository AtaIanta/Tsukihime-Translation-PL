　The plug of the bathtub of blood called Vrouve is pulled out.
<Page2>
　The burning delusion ends.
　The last boundary is stepped over.
　At last.
　With a scream that rips through the world, the true face of that vampire appears.
<Page3>
　The atmosphere creaks.
　The activity of the atom switches from early to late.
　The electrons that have been bounced off the solidified super cold faults and have nowhere to go react.
<Page4>
　The blue flame that covered the surface of the earth was not a flame.
　That was something similar to vaporization heat, heat that is lost from the earth.
<Page5>
"''---Ah, really,''
　The cold-blooded arm is held up.
　The palms of his hands were spread out, as if craving warmth and heat.
<Page6>

　It took two seconds to reach the city.
　The glacier reached the buildings on the ground and froze them all in an instant.
　...... What if.
　If there were still people in that building who hadn't evacuated, it shut down every person and every heat.
<Page10>
　I shuddered at the sight before me, saying it was impossible.
　I was terrified of what was to come.
　It's just a coincidence that I'm alive right now.
　If the place I am in was in the same direction as Alcade, I would have been frozen alive by now.
<Page11>
　The river of flames radiated out, but it was a slow disaster.
　The fleeing feet of humans were faster than the spreading fire.

　If he goes above ground, what's in front of him will die helplessly. ......!

<Page19>
"I'm not sure what to make of this.
　How dare you take so much fire from me."
<Page20>
　A voice like a blade, filled only with hatred.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page21>
"I'm sure you'll agree. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not. It was a hateful murderer who saved you. Well, that's just the beginning.

　But first, a little courtesy.
<Page24>
"Answer me, my servant of the dwarf cattle.
　The proof of the ancestor. The root lesion. Its cave like a great whirlpool.
　An illegitimate child with a new principle.
　What is blood to you?"
<Page25>
　It was a stern voice that did not fit the occasion.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page26>
"I will respectfully accept it.
　For me, blood is warmth itself.
　It is the heat of life. It is the elixir that heals my frostbite. It turns my world, my principles.
　So be it. Without blood, I would freeze to death in this cold."
　In a respectful voice, he revealed his identity.
<Page27>
"I remembered .......
　It is a strange thing that hates, fears and avoids human beings, drifted in the sea and set up a castle.
　One of the twenty-seven Patriarchs, Zelia Achenbaum.
　I've heard that he ruled the land for over a thousand years without having any children,.............
　So you killed them and took them?
<Page28>
"...... Yes. I'm not an heir. I'm just a knight. I was a knight. Eternity is too much for me.
<Page29>
　The vampire's right hand is pointed at his own shadow.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.

"Yes. It was a short reign.
<Page31>
"...... You're a tough guy. You're so weak you can't even materialize your fantasies, and you want to go toe to toe with me?
"It's not necessary. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

　The air distorts.

　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm going to try.

"But you don't know that.
　His territory is a part of this planet, but it is a life-sphere that was excluded as "unfit to live".

　A number of corpses crawl out from underneath it, groaning.
<Page43>
"This hunt is now mine.
　Go pick up the woman's corpse.
　The adaptability. The all-powerful blood that surpasses all suffering, in my hands."
<Page44>
　Vrouve commands, and the corpses walk up to Alcade.
<Page45>
　The victory or defeat has been decided.
　Our strategy has failed.
　You can't contain him with chains anymore.
　Alcade is defeated, and the city is engulfed in a cold wave.
　Everything is dead.
　I'm standing right in front of it, watching the final scene unfold below me...

　Ice cubes sliding through the air.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　---It's a great way to get the most out of your life.
　Will I continue to conceal it, or will I discard one of my weapons here?
　You can find a lot more information on the web.
<Page2>
"---!"
　A headache tightens up your brain.
　It's a good idea to keep your eyes focused on the weapon.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page3>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　The knife is aligned with the flying icicles. Man is a wild beast. It's a good idea to have a good eye for detail.
<Page4>
　If your body can still move satisfactorily, a weapon like this is just as big as a piece of gravel.
　But...
<Page5>
　But this is the end of the "surprise attack" from the front.
　His eyes are telling us.
　I saw it.
　I don't care about reason or logic. He just said he'd never let you go on from there again.
<Page6>
　With this, I've completely lost my winning hand.
　Was this the right place to discard my trump card?
　---It's not good.
　But there is no other way.
　In order to survive, I have to expose my hand here.
　So you have to search with all your might for something to gain in return.
<Page7>
"Ah!"
　I'm going to use the least amount of movement to cut it down.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page8>
　There are only two minutes left until the limit of activity.
　---The excitement drives out the fear.
　In a desperate struggle to the death, the view of life and death is reversed.
<Page9>
"...... is not a miracle.
　But it's not common sense either.
　What is the logic of letting my thirst pass through me like water?"
<Page10>
　There is a small gap in the sweep of the ice.
　He concentrates the cold waves from his own body into a single point, creating a colder vortex.
<Page11>
"...... Spare me, but just die.
　Don't make my heart race too much."
　Like a pulley gliding through the frozen atmosphere, the ice mass shoots out ......!
<Page12>
　Slash off the deadly bullet.
　As long as you're standing in front of Alcade, you have no choice but to stop what's being shot out here.
<Page13>
　At this distance, it takes 1.5 seconds for the ice spear to reach you.
　As long as my body is moving, I can maintain this state.
　During that time, I'll think of what I can do.
<Page14>
　Vroob doesn't move a single step.
　Why isn't he moving? You'll need to have a good idea of what you're doing. It's the other way around. I hypothesize that it's not that he doesn't need to move because he has flying tools, but that he can't move when he's in that state in the first place.
<Page15>
　He was driven into a corner by Alcade, and ran out of fuel in the form of blood. That cold air should be seen as a last-ditch measure of self-preservation for a monster on the verge of death.
<Page16>
　It's a wild theory. But it makes sense.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
　If you're a living creature, whether it's hot or cold, just approaching him will kill you.
<Page17>
　If you approach within 10 meters, you will freeze to death in two seconds.
　At this rate, I will eventually collapse. It's the same as when a person gets lost in the snow and falls asleep. In the case of a person, if the body temperature is below 34 degrees Celsius or above 43 degrees Celsius, the brain cells stop functioning and consciousness disappears.
<Page18>
　Observe the whole, not the individual.
　No thought is interrupted, and the knife is automatically slipped the moment it is seen.
<Page19>
　---In the midst of this, I revise my earlier guess.
　That cold wave is developing in all directions.
　But is its density really constant?
<Page20>
　The fact that the earth's surface is the coldest means that there are temperature differences within the cold wave. It's a strong or weak standard, but flaws do exist.
　It's an all-around defense, but it's not invincible in all directions.
<Page21>
"...... Protecting the Lord in the depths of death? Brave, but limited."
　The long spear that struck down Alcade was taken up from the shadows again.
　I'm not sure if that was a call to action, but there's a very large ice tree behind him with branches...
"I'm not sure what to say. By the numbers, let's push ......!"
<Page22>
　I stopped thinking and poured all my abilities into intercepting it.
　This is impossible. You can't kill them all.
　There will always be a bullet somewhere. ---It is not allowed.
　Such naivety is not allowed.
　You're not allowed to even try.
　If you bleed out, that's the end. The cold air will not allow even a minute's respite, and will come to stop my life.
　That's why I'm going to kill you. Why are you struggling?
　I keep my mind fresh and only look down at the "line".
<Page23>
　The total number of prey deployed, twenty-six machines.
　What to slash first, and what to miss, I stare at the plan as it is.
　---In the interstices, I certainly saw.
　The location of death that exceeds the line.
　That point is the extreme point of death that creates the line.
<Page24>
"---Ku.
　The wall of death that looms before you.
　But I could see it, and now I certainly saw the same thing.
　Just as I will die here.
　There's a chance he'll die here, too. ......!
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"
<Page25>
　But the conclusion was reached.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　The ligaments that scream from the repetition of rapid braking.
　The cells are also destroyed by the ultra-low temperature.
　The fingertips are gnawed. The limbs can no longer move as they should.
<Page26>
"----, ha---"
　The inevitable predicament.
　A lost battle with no chance of victory.
　I'm not sure what to do with it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　Above all, I myself have no hope of surviving.
　And yet...
<Page27>
"The ------...
　The impulse of the beast that takes root in the depths.
　In this predicament.#Why are you smiling?
<Page28>
"I'm not sure.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to do. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page29>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page30>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm sure you've heard of it, but I'm not sure if you have.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page31>
　As it was, he threw the rock at Vroove as if to say, "It doesn't hurt.
<Page32>
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　After all, you can't kill him with a simple weapon.
　---But.
　With Alcade's counterattack now, the last piece fits.
<Page33>
　I've already come to a conclusion.
　There's only one way to kill him. If I can get close enough to him before my body is stopped by the cold wave, I can kill him for sure.
<Page34>
　But how?
　My legs are too slow to zero in on this distance in under two seconds. I need the help of something faster.
　For best results, I'd like to get into his range through a thin layer of cryogenic. I don't think I can do that with my legs.
<Page35>
　If we don't, we're dead. You don't have a choice.
　The question is not, "Can I do it?"
　It's, "How can I kill it?"
<Page36>
　You have to be ready.
　If there's one way to get close, it's...
C:>It's ...... throwing.
C:>It's ...... sliding.
C:>It's a ...... tow.

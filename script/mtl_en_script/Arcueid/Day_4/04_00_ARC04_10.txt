　Kincorn.
　There was a bright sound that was terribly out of place.
"Ele...... bator......?"
　Another box arrives, next to the one from earlier.
　My exhausted brain does not consider what it means.
<Page2>
　The door opens.
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page3>
　...... Oh, I am so disgusted.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　Inside it.
<Page4>
"------ empty?"
　There was nothing in it, nothing at all.
<Page5>
　...... I guess you could call it a letdown.
　The danger is over.
　Even though it's all over, you can still get an idea of what's going on downstairs.
　You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page6>
"Ah, ha, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who!"
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page7>
　There is no doubt about it.
　From the stairs of the elevator hall, a survivor comes running up, gasping for breath,......!
<Page8>
"Ha, ha, ha ...... yay, this place isn't burning ......!"
　You can hear the jubilation.
　The sound of shoes does not stop.
　The owner of the voice appeared in the elevator hall as if rolling.
<Page9>
"You!　Hey, you there!"
　She notices me in the hallway and starts running again.
<Page10>
"Yay, I'm saved......!　I'm saved ......!"
　Her face, which had been drawn together with fear, began to glow with joy.
<Page11>
"What ......?"
　A pale hand that pulls that hope back into hell.
"No,......, no, no, no, no!
　The woman's voice begging for help while looking at me.
<Page12>
　There was no resistance at all.
　The restraints were not contrived.
　As soon as the hand grabbed her, her consciousness was lost, as if waking up from a dream.
<Page13>
　---Stop it.
　---Stop it, stop it.
　---The woman.#　---I had nothing to do with it.#She was a good person.
　---Don't prey on her.
<Page14>
"Stop.
　The voice of restraint is not in time.
　It will not change when it reaches you.
<Page15>
　I stare at the neck of the woman.
　The star seems to scatter in the eyes.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
　Two bottomless evil eyes spinning in the blood of rage.
<Page16>
　The woman's limbs twitching and twitching.
"I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page17>
　It's a great way to make sure you get the most out of your vacation.
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your vacation.
<Page18>
　You can even hear the gloss of swallowing.
　After enjoying the woman for a while, the woman abandoned it carelessly.
　The woman who wavers like a dead tree.
　The ballerina who dances dangerously on the verge of the abyss of death.
　To that pitiful back.
<Page19>
　No scream was raised.
　Only the sound of bloodshed resounded.
　The back that splits.
　A spray of blood spurts out.
　The vampire is bathed in it and breathes a sigh of relief.
<Page20>
　The world changes completely.
　The physical temperature and reality finally match.
　A film of flames envelops the corridor.
　It's like a river rushing through a weir.
<Page21>
　The skin is scorched to a crisp.
　If I breathe now, my lungs will definitely be burned.
<Page22>
　But something is wrong.
　It is burning. The flames are definitely flickering.
　And yet the building is not burning.
　The only one who feels the flames is me, the creature.
<Page23>
　I get a headache.
　He starts walking towards me.
　He's the source of the river of fire.
　The closer he gets, the hotter the atmosphere gets.
<Page24>
　He's only 15 meters away now.
　Even at this distance, I can't breathe.
　I mean, the creature will die just by getting close to him.
<Page25>
　A skinny shadow walks towards me.
　A bizarre appearance. Elegant clothes and a savage cloak.
　A human figure, but clearly not human.
　Everything is out of place. It's crazy.
　Thirteen meters.
　He's coming at us in silence.
<Page26>
"---"
　I hold up the knife and stare at the man.
　There's no response. I wonder if he can see me in the first place.
　Ten meters.
　I stare at him.
　In the boiling flames, I visualize the line of death.
<Page27>
"---"
　The inside of my skull boils like soup.
<Page28>
　What the hell is that?
　A torrent of death that is intricately entwined, swirling, and dense.
　In the midst of it all, shining brightly, like a jewel...
<Page29>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I turned away from the headache.
　It's not good. It is not a good idea to keep looking at that man's "middle".
　It's a great way to make sure you get the most out of your vacation.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
<Page30>
　Eight meters.
　The distance approaches further.
　The temperature rises. But it's still not enough to cook the meat.
<Page31>
　Six meters.
　At that distance, he stops.
　His gaze focuses on me. After getting this close, the guy finally notices me.
<Page32>
　---Our gazes meet.
　Don't make eye contact with it.
　The white woman's warning flashed through my mind.
　But I can't take my eyes off it.
　I can't ignore that bottomless.
<Page33>
　That thing is different. It must be different from the evil eye that the white woman was talking about. That eye does not have the power to make the person who sees it into a golden bind. Because that is the eye of madness. It is the eye of the thing that is crazy. It's an ugly, hapless, self-inflicted freak of nature that's only driven by impulse, just like me.
<Page34>
"......!"
　Instinct senses the danger.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　But the body still does not move. You'll be able to't respond to a single fingertip.
<Page35>
　This is the reason why it's so important to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　No matter what means, no matter what methods are used, he appeals that he must leave this place immediately or his life will be lost.
<Page36>
　---But it's too late.
　That thing with the sick eyes never pays any attention to me at all.
　It burned me to death with its "hands".
<Page37>
"----"
　You'll die.
　That flame is real.
　The blue flames wetting the corridor are an effect of reality.
　Even if you are swallowed by it, you will not die instantly. Probably, it is like the phantom pain which scorches only life.
<Page38>
　But this is different.
　This flame is real. The skin is scorched just by approaching it. Life is carbonized just by touching it.
　It became the form of a sharp claw and was released.
<Page39>
　My body is cut in two from the body, and it burns up from the cut surface.
　The certainty was clearer than the fire.
　And yet, just before that
<Page40>
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I can do it.
<Page41>
"---Al, Quaid, ......?"
　The question leaked out of my throat in a voice.
　My thoughts have gone blank.
<Page42>
　I know the situation.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page43>
　The act was too unintelligible.
　It was my role to be a shield.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page44>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page45>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　No need to pull me this time.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page46>
　But it's not perfect either.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　Don't tell me that a direct hit will burn even Alcade,......?
<Page47>
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you're going to need to be able to pay for it.
<Page48>
　It's just a five second event.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page49>
"............"
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page50>
　The man has only Alquaid in his field of vision.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page51>
"..............."
　I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page52>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　There's no doubt about it. It was a blade.
　There's a long object hidden under that coat. It's probably the same one that slashed the woman in front of the elevator.
<Page53>
　The man's feet move.
　With the blade hidden under his coat, he tries to take a step towards Alcade.
<Page54>
""Rude. Identify yourself by your name if you are not a pig.
　Or were your parents too shapeless to teach you even the barest of manners?"
""------""
<Page55>
　The man's feet stop.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you're going to need to be able to pay for it.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with us.
<Page56>
""...... I know the etiquette.
　But I have not yet the name to tell you."
<Page57>
"You have no courtesy, but you have enough shame.
　You've lost your original name,......, but you still have a name to call yourself, don't you?　It seems that you have just taken over, but you are still a part of the ancestors.
<Page58>
　The ...... air changes.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page59>
"---Vlove."
　The flame spreading vampire was annoyed.
"Vrove Arkhangelis."
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page60>
"I don't know the name. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. Are your parents suicidal?"
"...... is not so. I've got to go.
<Page61>
"You're the new founder.
　So now you want to kill me to make yourself look good?
"...... honor lies within you.
　I only take what I want."
<Page62>
"That's a fine attitude, but you'll have to limit yourself to me.
　That's a bit much.
"...... No. This city is defiled.
　If I don't burn it down, it's against my principles."
"Oh, yeah. So you're a third-rate mortal, a barbarian.
<Page63>
"...... I'm aware that I'm crude.
　The princess of the true ancestors. Give me your heart."
<Page64>
"......!"
　I'm not sure what that means. You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page65>
"I'm not sure what to do. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　If you don't want to become charred, stay behind me.
<Page66>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what's going on. ...... This is his weapon?　Really?
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to buy a lot of things.
<Page67>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I'm going to concentrate on my consciousness and hold the knife.
<Page68>
　---It's coming.
　The corridor is now a cave of flames.
　Vroob unleashes the blade under his coat right now and .
<Page69>
"Where's ......?"
　---.
　He suddenly turns his back on us.
<Page70>
　He walked down the hall as if nothing had happened, then took the elevator and left the floor without a care in the world.
<Page71>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I don't understand any of this anymore. ......!
　The two dogs that attacked me, the flames that covered the corridor, and the nightmarish reality that hit this hotel!
<Page72>
"You...
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to make of that. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page73>
　---You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
　It was a wound made by protecting me from that man.
<Page74>
"I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
<Page75>
"It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.#---I'm sorry.
I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
<Page76>
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
<Page77>
"------"
　I'm not sure what to say.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to take advantage of the fact that you'll be able to get a lot more out of it.
<Page78>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page79>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
<Page80>
"You're a vampire who doesn't die at night. ...... Yeah, ...... but ...... I'm kind of at my limit.
"Oh, ----"
"I'm sorry, but you have to take me back to my room.
<Page81>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　If you die on your own, I really don't know what I can do for you. ......!
<Page82>
"No, wake up, Alcade. ......!
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　And.
"......."
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page83>
"............"
　...... I lost it worrying about it.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page84>
"...... Huh. I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what's going on.
　But in this case, it can't be helped.
　It's not a good idea to stay in a hotel any longer than you have to.
<Page85>
　It's ...... such a tragedy.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page86>
"............ Gosh."
　The headache does not cease.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page87>
"I'm not sure what to make of this, but it's a good idea.
<Page88>
　I've only been there once, but I definitely remember the place.
　It's a good idea to have a good time.
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page89>
　The sky was brighter.
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page90>
　The reason why the man left was this simple.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page91>
　...... Anyway, we have to let Alcade rest now.
　You can't get a taxi.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page92>
　It's a good idea to get as far away from the hotel as possible and get on a bus to Soya Station.
　It was fortunate that it was early in the morning, so we didn't attract any attention.
<Page93>
　The emergency exit at the back of the building was still the same as the day before yesterday.
　I guess neither the residents nor the caretaker noticed that the key was "broken".
<Page94>
　6:30 a.m.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with your family and friends.

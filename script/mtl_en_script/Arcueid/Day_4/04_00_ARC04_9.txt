"What's wrong with you, Shiki?
"Nothing, nothing. I'm just laughing at you because you're a cowardly chicken.

　This is a great way to get the most out of your business. It's not like you're in a sauna.
　It's a good idea to have a digital clock on hand.
<Page19>
　The clock reads 04:32 AM.
　The temperature had dropped to 11 degrees Celsius due to the morning chill.
　It's strange that I'm sweating in that temperature.
<Page20>
　No, to begin with...
　This room feels as hot as midsummer. ......!
<Page21>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to say.

　She is looking at the monitor with a different emotion than I am.
<Page27>
　The lobby sank into a sea of flames in less than a minute.
　The fire alarm does not go off.
　There is no change in the thermometer.
　I can't stop sweating, and my throat is thirsty with every breath I take.
<Page28>
　I don't even have to think about it anymore.
　It's the enemy. The burning corpse of daylight--that thing has come to this hotel,......!
<Page29>
"Fucking ......!"
　I ran to the window to check out the outside.
<Page30>
　There is no change in the cityscape.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what's going on in your life.
　There is no one coming into the hotel, no one running out of the hotel.
<Page31>
"What's going on, Alcade!
"'...............'

　I ---- can't spare my own life.
　It reminds me of the scene I had yesterday when I killed Alcade.
<Page2>
　A time filled with the smell of blood and death.
　I don't want to go through something like that again.
　If I stay with Alcade, the same thing will definitely happen again. If you don't want that, you have to go back to the mansion.
<Page3>
"------"
　...... There is a major flaw in my choice.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　This isn't running away.
　I'm just trying to get back, I tell myself.
<Page4>
"Let's go back to the ...... house. I'm sure you will."
　By the time the night is over, something will have been settled that I don't know about.
<Page5>
"Hey there. Can I have a word?
"What?
　Just as I was about to get up from the bench, a voice called out to me from behind.
<Page6>
"I don't mind if you leave me alone, but you look so pathetic.
<Page7>
　There was a girl standing there, who looked like she had never seen her before, but looked like she remembered seeing her somewhere.
　They seem to be junior high school age, but they are not wearing a uniform. I wonder if she was boycotting school as well as me.
<Page8>
"'...... What's pathetic about it?'
"The face. It's a color like clay. That's what people look like when they die, right?
<Page9>
"------"
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
<Page10>
"It's not a joke, it's an experience. The old man I know stopped breathing after three hours from such a pale face. If we had called an ambulance, he might have survived, so..."
<Page11>
　The girl doesn't come close to me.
　She kept a distance of about one meter.
<Page12>
"Do you want to call an ambulance?
　If so, please lend me your mobile phone. I don't want to use mine.
<Page13>
"Well...
Ha."
　In the unexpected offer, a breath of relief was leaking out.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page14>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page15>
"No, I'm fine. It's just a little anemia, it'll go away soon.
　---But thank you for calling on me. You saved my life.
<Page16>
"I see. I'll leave you to it.
　...... Are you feeling sick all the time?
"What?
　In the event that you're in a position to do this, you'll be able to.
<Page17>
"I'm not sure if it's ...... natural or not.
　Ever since I was a kid, I get dizzy when I exercise a little.
"'Hmm. Then dogs are no good for me. I can't play with them.
"No, I don't mind a walk.
　I don't have any desire to get a dog, but it's sad to be completely denied.
<Page18>
"Like a walk.
　You still don't look well. I suggest you go home and get some rest."
<Page19>
　The girl walked away.
"Is that ......?"
　As she left, it occurred to me that she might have been feeling much worse than I was.
<Page20>
　In the end, I went to the park to rest my body and then headed home.
　The sun had set and it was getting dark.
<Page21>
　It was past seven in the evening.
　The curfew of the house is eight o'clock, so if I don't hurry home, Akiha will give me a hard time again.
<Page22>
　The streets around the house are as empty as ever.
　Even though the sun has just set, it is as quiet as if it were midnight.
<Page23>
"By the way, this place is ......
　I remember that this was the place where I came to check on the noisy wild dogs on the night I came back to the house.
<Page24>
"What?
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
<Page25>
"------"
　My consciousness froze.
　The question of why here?
　And then, of course, you understand.
<Page26>
　It's not only Alcade that was found in the back alley.
　You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
　I think I covered up my thoughts so that I wouldn't notice that fact.
<Page27>
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't get caught in the middle of the action.
　At that moment.
<Page28>
　It's ---- strange.
　Suddenly, the whole area has turned red.
<Page29>
　I hear a rumbling sound.
　It sounds very close.
　The whole body is bouncing like a spring in intense pain.
　I'm bouncing again and again.
　My consciousness, my body, my vision, my world.
　Spinning like an emergency lamp.
<Page30>
　Gurgling. Rumble. Gurgling.
　The sound.
　Apparently, it's coming from your own body.
<Page31>
"■■■■■---!"
　I fall to the asphalt.
　The limbs do not move. There is no more shape to move.
　The only pain is in the eyeballs.
<Page32>
"It's not even warm enough.
　　You're not even a dog that protects the Lord."
<Page33>
　I heard a muffled voice.
　The sound of fat exploding on the asphalt.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

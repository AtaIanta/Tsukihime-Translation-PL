"Hmm. I'm not a vampire.
　How did you kill me?
"What?
<Page3>
"So I'm asking you what kind of method did you use?
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to take advantage of the fact that you'll be able to get a lot more out of it.
<Page4>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to say. What kind of vintage mysteries did you use to make me incapacitated?
<Page5>
"No, what kind of vintage mysteries are you talking about?
　You can see that Alquade is serious.

"It's convenient to be able to cut steel with a knife, but it doesn't mean you can cut anywhere you want. You can only cut where you can see the line, so you can't even use it for carpentry.
　When I cut you,......, you can cut a woman's skin with a knife, right?

"I don't think vampires are monsters. I don't need a vampire to tell me I'm a monster!
"A monster is a monster. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.

"......?　A ...... that sees the death of things?
"I'm not sure what to do.
　Shiki. I think your eyes are connected to a place that should not be connected to any living thing. Are those eyes something you were born with?"
"...... No, it's been like this for a long time, but it's not something I was born with.
<Page20>
"Then you've tried dying at least once before, haven't you?
"You're not a vampire, you can't die that easily.
　...... But yes, I have. I almost died in an accident once. It wasn't until later that I started seeing lines."
<Page21>
"Hmmm. I'm sure there was a potential predisposition, but I'm sure that's what triggered it. I'm not sure what to make of that. ...... direct death demon eyes, huh?

"Not as well as you can actually perceive them, but I can explain them to you as knowledge.
<Page24>
"What you're looking at is the result of all things, the mortality of things. What you're looking at is the result of all things, the mortality of things, or to put it more simply, the mortality of all things, .......
"----"
<Page25>
　It is.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for a new way to look at the world.
<Page26>
　......The result of all things. The future of things.
　I've never been aware of it.
　I'm trying not to be conscious of it.
<Page27>
"...... What are you talking about? I'm not sure what you're talking about.
<Page28>
"So that line is 'death'.
　Okay, Shiki?　I'm not sure what to do.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　Death is not something that comes, it is something that is contained in the moment of birth and will manifest itself one day. It is cause and effect. You've heard of the law of cause and effect, haven't you?"
<Page29>
"It's here and it has to go. The flow of atoms, the promise of energy. The order does not tolerate a single exception, even the smallest mistake.
　Because if there is such a thing, the premise of this universe will collapse. It would just fizzle out."
<Page30>
　No, even so.
　Isn't the universe, indeed, a misguided story?
<Page31>
"It's not misguided!
　Your eyes are the worst eyes I've ever seen!
"------
<Page32>
"Okay?　Extinction is the preordained rule of all things.
　Even the longest lifespan, the most powerful life has this. Even if some life has a life span longer than the life span of the universe, it does not live indefinitely.
<Page33>
"This predetermined 'extinction' is the 'time of death' of a thing.
　So if you have the ability to understand the concept of mortality, and if you have a brain and eyeballs that are connected to it, it is not impossible to see it with your eyes.
<Page34>
"This is what the 'line' you are looking at is.
　If I were to theorize in your way, I would say that it is a fatal flaw in the atomic bond.
　Or maybe it's a switch in the gene pool that causes the death of the individual.
<Page35>
"In any case, what you are looking at is the line that makes things easy to die, the conclusion of death itself.
　I don't know how you've been able to live your life in such a state. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.

　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page37>
"There is no way that there is such a thing, much less a way to see it.
<Page38>
"You can see it.
　Normally, when a creature is decapitated, it is killed. This one stopped because it was decapitated.
　In other words, a creature that can't be decapitated can't be killed.
Well, that's me, so make an exception.
<Page39>
"You can ignore that rule.
　Even if you are dealing with a thing that nullifies all external factors, kill it first. The person who is killed will be 'dead' afterwards, right?
　It's not that you were able to kill it because you disconnected it.
　In your case, you killed the thing, and as a result, the target is severed."
<Page40>
"'See, if this is not a monster, what is it?
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　You are, Shiki. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.

<Page43>
　Because ever since that day, I've been shown a world that will end.
　I've been informed of the possibility that everything could fall apart in a second.
　As long as I'm alive, I'm surrounded by it.
　I've been surrounded by so many signs of death.
<Page44>
"...... Then what?
　I'll be able to kill you, too. I'm a noisy guy who kills everything.
"Really?　Then let's give it a try.

　Lines start to stir all over the room.#.#　My ...... vision fills with the consequences of death.#.
<Page50>
"'------
What?"
　It was a miracle that made me want to doubt my eyes.
<Page51>
　There is a white moon outside the window.

"How?　You can hardly see the line, can you?
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll do it.
　So it would be impossible for your eyes to kill it.
<Page55>
"Hmm, I wonder if I can still see a little bit.

<Page61>
　In other words, even if I can see such a "line", I can't kill anything that moves.
　The non-human thing laughed it off, saying that the fear I had was only mitigated by such words.
<Page62>
　Yes, it's a funny story. It's a comforting joke.
　No matter what metaphor, no matter what flaw I'm taught, the way I've been looking at the world will never change.
　I'm a broken part of the world that shouldn't be mixed up.
<Page63>
　Yeah, but still...
　I'm seeing things that are so impossible
　I'm seeing things that are impossible.
<Page64>
　A large flower that plays the moonlight.
　...... That's right. It's not that I wanted eternity.
　It's just that there are things that I can touch.
　I wanted to live with hope...
<Page65>
"Ouch."
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of. I put on my glasses and switched from the miraculous sight to my original vision.
<Page66>
"................"
　Alcade is staring at us suspiciously.
<Page67>
"It's ....... Is there anything more?"
<Page68>
"'No, I don't mean that.
　If you wear those glasses, you can't see the lines?"
<Page69>
"'...... Well, yes.
　A guy I met gave them to me a long time ago when my eyes were like this.
　I only use the lenses now, but thanks to them I'm able to live a normal life.
<Page70>
"I see, that's right.
　No matter how strong your heart is, if you face death all the time, you'll either go insane or have your eyeballs crushed.
<Page71>
"...... You know what? You can say whatever you want from now on, and you can say all kinds of noisy things. You should be a little more reserved. It is also close. Stop. It's a good idea to stop right there. If you don't stop, I'll throw a vase at you!"
<Page72>
　I felt myself in danger and backed away.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

"I'm not sure what to say. Let me see that.

"I'm not going to destroy it.
　Hey, hey, hey. I'm just going to look at it, okay?
<Page75>
　What kind of stupid statement is this ......?
　I'm...
C:>I ...... was so dumbfounded that I just handed it over.
C:>...... No, I'm not going to take that hand.

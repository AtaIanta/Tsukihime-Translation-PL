"............ Okay."
　I take a small ...... deep breath and shake off my hesitation.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with your family. ...... Swallow your hesitation and take out a knife from your bag and walk to the door of your room.
<Page2>
"---Shiki?"
"...... I'll go check on him.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family.
<Page3>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　My throat hurts worse than when I was in my room. The air around me was rough and hot, like sandpaper.
<Page4>
　The hallway was frighteningly quiet.
　There was no noise.
　There is no sign of anyone.
　There was no ■■ running around.
　There was no burnt-out ■■ either.
　It was. It's a taut, silent space that makes you want to think that the scene you saw on the monitor was a lie.
<Page5>
"There is no ............ abnormality, is there?
　I'm going to walk down the hallway.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your day.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure. I'm not sure. A foreign substance.
　The pest that disturbs the atmosphere of the place is usually beaten and crushed.
<Page6>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　Once again, I take a deep breath to calm down.
　It's a great way to make sure that you don't slip on your knife with sweat.
　I'm not sure what to make of this. ......
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for a great deal more.
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but it's a good idea.
<Page7>
　I'm not sure if the eyeball is trying to get into the brain or not.
　Or is the brain trying to swallow the eyeball?
　Biting down on the dull pain, I walk down the road of intense heat.
<Page8>
"------"
　I'm sorry.
　My eyes are sore.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
　Oh, I know this one.
　It's the feeling you get right before you collapse from anemia.
<Page9>
"Haha ----- ah"
　I want to stay.
　It's a great way to get a good night's sleep.
<Page10>
　The elevator came into view.
　It's a long corridor.
　There are more than 20 meters from here to the elevator hall.
　It's a long way, I thought.
　I thought I should go back.
　---something.
　A few more steps, I thought, and it would be irreversible.
<Page11>
　I heard a sound.
　As if to disturb the harmony of this clean, lifeless space.
　The chime of the elevator sounded.
<Page12>
　I stopped in my tracks, too ominous.
　Only the eyes stare at the uninvited object.
<Page13>
　The lamp stops.
　The box arrives.
　I see a 'line' on the elevator door far ahead.
　No, it is.
　It is so dense that it already looks like a mottled wall.
<Page14>
　The door opens.
　A narrow, steel box opens.
<Page15>
　Inside the box.
　An overflow of flesh.
　The flesh of things that were alive before.
<Page16>
"------"
　I stopped breathing.
　Just as the brain refuses to think, the lungs have given up their activity.
<Page17>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　In the middle of it, two dogs gobbling up the food.
<Page18>
　The vision becomes bright red.
　Red mucus overflows from the elevator with a gurgling sound.
　In a sea of blood, people, bones, brains, fingers, and organs.
　The two black dogs were the only living life.
<Page19>
"Ah..."
　Reason is refusing to accept this scene.
　In the end of the corridor, in the elevator, the dogs are ransacking the body of a person.
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where by and how to use it, please do not hesitate to contact us.
　A lot of screams leak out, which were not there until just now.
<Page20>
　It is, if it listens well.
　And the sound that meat is chewed with a gurgle.
　It was the voice of the demise of the person who is not even a human language anymore, or the scream of help.
<Page21>
　The brain that is directly connected with hearing thinks.
　I can't even see it, but it's in my head.
　Burned alive.
　The figure of the people who are eaten alive is reproduced.
<Page22>
　There was a man who noticed the abnormal temperature. The moment he opened the door to go outside, he was enveloped by the eternal fire that had filled the room and died.
　There was a girl who locked herself in her room and broke down in tears. The flames that came up from the lobby filled the floor, and the girl turned to ashes from inside her body like a steaming fish in the bathtub.
　The adults rushed to the elevator as fast as they could. There were dozens of people in the elevator. They were no longer human beings, and they ate up all the adults who came.
<Page23>
　The screams were split between fear of being eaten and despair of burning up.
　There was no exception for any of them.
　Under these feet, in this big box called a hotel.
　It was a hellscape so familiar that I could feel it on my skin.
<Page24>
"'------'
　I feel like throwing up.
　But you can't throw up.
　I know that if I do that I will become one of those red sea.
<Page25>
"The... a... I'm not sure what to say. A. Ha."
　I restarted the breathing that had stopped.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website and see if you can find anything of interest.
<Page26>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page27>
The "............ is."
　In other words.
　So there's no one alive anymore.
<Page28>
　The two black dogs begin to run.
　In this hunting ground, I was the last prey.
<Page29>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　Numerous lines are visible on its body.
<Page30>
　Even though it is ---.
　My paralyzed head didn't send me any instructions to fight or run away.
<Page31>
　The first black dog leaps.
　Its speed is not comparable to humans.
　The 20-meter corridor took no more than two seconds.
<Page32>
　The mouth of the black dog opens.
　The fangs, which are aligned like saws, come toward the throat.
<Page33>
　Definitely and quickly.
　The moment you recognize that it's coming.
　The black dog's fangs made a gurgling sound and bit into my throat.
　Tono Shiki is dead.
<Page34>
　No. That's wrong.
　You can't be killed by something like this, and you won't die.
　It is not hesitant to have a human being dead.
　It's a hot day in ---- summer.
　A long time ago, or maybe seven years ago.
　I'm sure I've witnessed more devastation than this,----
<Page35>
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　The moment the fangs touched the skin, just before biting into the carotid artery, my arm automatically moved.
<Page36>
　I was stunned even by myself.
　Like a machine with only the function of cutting things, I wasted no time in passing the knife between the dog's eyes.
　This is because that was the first dog's "line".
<Page37>
　Usually, when an animal's brain is damaged, its movement does not immediately stop.
　The muscles that have already received the signal from the brain will execute the last command as much as possible.
<Page38>
　In the event that you've got a little bit of a headache, the black dog's fangs will probably bite your neck off.
　Ah, well---that, normally.
<Page39>
　But Kuroinu is "dead".
　Death is a stop. When he was killed by me, he lost all potency.
<Page40>
　The first dog falls to the ground.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page41>
"------"
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money. Literally, the bones and flesh are rotten.
<Page42>
　But this was a mistake.
　This thing's "line" is not on its face, but on its chest.
　If you stab the mouth, it is merely a laceration.
<Page43>
　The knife reached the back of the head from inside the mouth of the black dog.
　Naturally, the hand that holds the knife ends up inside the black dog's mouth.
<Page44>
"------ ah."
　The black dog is still alive.
　The jaws are closed.
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page45>
"Ah, ah---!"
　This isn't a joke ......!
　How dare you stick a knife in a dog's mouth and try to bite off your own arm, I am!
<Page46>
"This ---- .........!"
　I managed to struggle to pull my arm out.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page47>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your investment.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page48>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page49>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to have a good time.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page50>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　The arm is bitten off...!
　I can't believe it, a dog is not a creature that can bite something in this condition,......!
<Page51>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page52>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　To be honest, it's a matter of no concern to the confused mind.
<Page53>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I've been trying to escape, but the black dog is biting my arm.
　You can't escape.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　There is no choice but to run away.
I just want to stay alive. If I want to survive, there's only one thing I have to do.
　That is. Just kill this thing.
<Page54>
"------"
　How do we do that?
　One of its arms will be torn off in seconds.
　It's got the knife.
　It's got me pinned down.
　Even if you can pull your arm out, the next thing you know, you're free and the black dog is biting your neck.
<Page55>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　In that desperate situation, a humorous smile came to mind.
　It's okay. It's a good idea to take a look at it first and then think about it carefully.
　I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what's going on.
<Page56>
　You see. For example, you can see more than enough "lines" on the back of the dog's head.
　In this way, the way to survive is always simple.
<Page57>
"Guh ----!"
　So, why do you hesitate?
　This is a violent animal. This is a man-eating beast of prey.
　But this is one life that is so close, so suffocating, that it burns the heartbeat.
<Page58>
"Ha, g---!"
　The force of the bite on the arm becomes even stronger.
　It's stupid. It is too stupid. It's a contradiction that makes you want to kill it.
　In the providence where you are killed if you do not kill.
　Why do I, a human being...
　It is a cruel act and hesitates...
<Page59>
　The red blood falls to the face with a drop.
　The red blood drips down the forehead and sloshes into the eyes.
　In the back of the eyeball, the vermilion darkness seeps in.
<Page60>
"A ----
　It's a great way to get the most out of your life.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page61>
"...... Still, I'm not
　You can't kill something that's alive."
　---It is a hypocrisy.
　I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.
<Page62>
　...... Oh, that's right.
　But not at that time.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page63>
　But now, it's definitely my own choice.
　The ...... teacher told you, Shiki.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page64>
　I'm not sure what to say.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page65>
　---That's hypocrisy too.
　　　　Because, you know, a long time ago.
<Page66>
"Oh --------
　......Bad dreams of childhood.
<Page67>
　---What are you waiting for?
<Page68>
　...... It was a hot summer day.
<Page69>
　---And if you don't kill them, they will kill you.
<Page70>
　...... In front of me, the shadow of a boy covered in blood.
<Page71>
　　　　　---You are already.
<Page72>
　...... I have hot, hot, red blood on my hands.
<Page73>
　　　　　　　You've killed a man once.
<Page74>
"Ahhhh!"
　I stabbed him.
　Instead of pulling his arm out, he buried it further into the black dog's head.
<Page75>
　A cry of pain echoed in his eardrums.
　The black dog's agony resembled a high-pitched woman's scream. I've got my arm stuck in my mouth and I'm crying even though I can't wail properly.
<Page76>
　I'm sure it hurts that much.
　I don't care.
　I thrust the knife deeper into the bitten arm.
<Page77>
　The knife emerged from the back of the black dog's head.
　It split the skull, cut the skin easily, and
　It sprinkled blood and brains.
　In addition, my arm that grasped the knife has already completely pierced the head.
<Page78>
　Still, the black dog is alive.
　There's only one thing to do.
　I reach out my other arm. I rip the knife from my bloody fingers and re-hold it with my left hand.
　The dog's entire body rasps pleadingly.
　The strength had drained from its fangs, as if to show its apology.
　I don't know.#I briefly dismantled the black dog as per the 'line'.

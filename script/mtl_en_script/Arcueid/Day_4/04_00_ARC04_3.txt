"'...... Shiki-sama. What did you do yesterday?
<Page4>
"It's not anything special. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
　---On the way?
"I was just resting in the park.
　...... But Akiba was right, it was rash. I'll be careful from now on.
<Page5>
"I'm not blaming you.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with your family.
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page6>
　This is the first time that I have ever seen such a thing.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but it's a good idea.
<Page7>
　The more you approach the school, the more students in uniform you will find.
　The time was 7:45.
　Everyone is taking it easy on the way to school, probably because there's plenty of time before HR.
<Page8>
　Of course, I'm one of them.
　I don't have to worry about being late this morning, and I can start my day as usual without any worries.
<Page9>
　As soon as I pass this intersection, I'm at the main gate.
　The traffic light turns red, and I stop in front of the crosswalk.
　On the other side of the sidewalk is the school's wall.
　The path to school is protected by a guardrail, and students are still heading towards the school gate.
<Page10>
　At this hour, the only people on the sidewalk are the students of our school.
　There should be only one.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website to see if there is anything you need to know.
<Page11>
"-----," he said.
　It was her that was there.
　A white figure that is unmistakable.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page12>
"------"
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page13>
"------"
　No, that's not even true.
　I'm not sure what to say, but I'd like to know what you think.
"------"
　I'm not sure what to say.
<Page14>
　It's also a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　I killed him.
　I killed it.
　I killed her.
　I killed her, I killed her, I killed her...
<Page15>
"------ is..."
　But then...
　I don't know how it got there.
　How could that thing...
　How could that thing be right in front of me in real life ......?
<Page16>
　The signal turns green.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　The woman sits on the guardrail and shakes her leg dangling.
<Page17>
　She looked as if she was waiting for something or someone.
　I have no idea how long she's been waiting, but there's nothing grim about her expression.
<Page18>
　---I wonder who she is waiting for.
　She is fidgety and restless, as if she were waiting for her lover.
<Page19>
　...... No, wait. Are you waiting?
　Are you waiting for someone?
　It's obvious. I'm sure you'll be able to.
　I'm sure I will.
　Everybody would be.
　If I'd been killed.
　I don't have to think about who I want to see first.
<Page20>
　---I have a bad feeling about this.
　A chill runs down my spine, like a hundred feet crawling.
　The spine seems to come out of the mouth.
<Page21>
　A white woman looked at me.
　Our eyes meet. Our intentions match. Everything makes sense correctly.
　No. That's just a coincidence. It has to be just a coincidence.
　There is no feeling. There is no connection. No relation.
<Page22>
　She's just a stranger who looks like him.
　She must be waiting for someone else.
　Otherwise, this moment would be a bad dream.
　Because, you know, a dead person, a person who's been dismembered like that, can't possibly be alive.
<Page23>
　And yet, the living woman looked at me and smiled.
　She said, "You're finally here.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
<Page24>
　The woman raised her hand and smiled familiarly, then sat up from the guardrail.
　She ruffled her hair and came at me as I stood there.
<Page25>
"What the ------ hell is that?
　I'm sorry, I'm dreaming.
　The traffic light turns red.
<Page26>
"Don't come ----, don't come, don't come---"
　The woman does not seem to be bothered, she crosses the road in a straight line where cars come and go.
<Page27>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your vacation.
　You can't tell if it's a dream or reality.
"You can find a lot more information on the web.
<Page28>
　The reality in front of your eyes will not change even if you raise your voice loudly.
　I was just running away from the white woman.
<Page29>
　I ran.
　I ran as fast as I could.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time with your family and friends.
<Page30>
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, -----!"
　The breathing is disordered, and the heart screams wildly.
　But I still ran.
　The drawn out face had abandoned its proper function.
<Page31>
　I'm not sure what to do. My throat burned. My lungs shriveled.
　The muscles in my hands were about to tear from shaking so much.
<Page32>
　Both of my legs kicked the ground in a haphazard, lazy fashion. Every time I took a step, I felt a numb pain in my thigh.
　It was okay, I thought. I didn't care if my legs were torn to shreds.
　Because if I didn't run, I was going to go crazy.
<Page33>
　Look behind you.
　A woman in white is walking towards me.
　She's definitely following me.
　The woman I killed is chasing me.
　That was more than enough reason for my mania.
<Page34>
"Ha, ha, ha ------!"
　I ignored my exploding heart and kept running.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page35>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　The chin goes up.
　Both arms are limp.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for and how to get it.
<Page36>
"You can find a lot more information on this at ----.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a good idea to take a look at your own personal life.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't get caught in the middle of the action.
　It's like a ghost in your rearview mirror.
<Page37>
"......... Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
　I laughed, even though it wasn't funny, and ran still laughing.
<Page38>
"'Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!'
　I couldn't stop laughing.
　But I still ran, and even though my body was telling me that I would die if I ran any further, I still ran.
<Page39>
　The reason for running is obvious.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't get caught up.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page40>
　There is no need for any reason or evidence.
　This is a natural rule, everyone knows the cause and effect retribution.
<Page41>
　If you kill a person, you will be killed.
　Since I killed her, she has the right to kill me.
　So...
　It's just a fact that Tono Shiki's life will end the moment he is hunted down.
<Page42>
"Ah..."
　I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family.
<Page43>
"This is a great way to get the most out of your day.

　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your vacation.
　As it was, the body did not move anymore.
<Page45>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I looked up and took a breath.
　---It was painful.
　I'm not getting enough oxygen at all.
　Thanks to this, I can't move my head.
　I don't even know what I'm doing.
　I don't know why I'm doing this.
　I don't know why, why, why the woman I killed is still alive.
<Page46>
　I'm pretty sure it's perfect.
　I killed her, in every conceivable extreme.
　I'm sure you'll be able to find a lot more information on this in the future.
<Page47>
"...... sure, I killed her."
　---That's right.
　I did kill her.
　I did kill him.
　I'm sure I killed him.
　Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
　Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why...
　Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why ------?
<Page48>
"Hey, are we done playing catch-up?"
　A clunk.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page49>
　The woman who came with light footsteps, shrugged her shoulders in disappointment, and leaned against the wall to me.
"Hello. I really appreciate your help yesterday."
　She gave me a carefree smile.
<Page50>
"......!"
　I feel like I'm going crazy.
　I don't know why you would want to look like that.
　The woman's smile is still on her face, and she walks into this closed off alleyway unceremoniously and cautiously.
<Page51>
"And here's something I forgot.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the details on the web.
<Page52>
　A black object is thrown out with a pop.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web.
<Page53>
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your vacation.
　I'm sure you'll agree.　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think it's a good idea.
<Page54>
"No---run, run, run ......!"
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family.
<Page55>
Hmm?"　You're done running after me, aren't you?
　Because this is a cul-de-sac. In addition, it is not popular, so there is no need to worry about being disturbed.
<Page56>
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　...... cul-de-sac?　Not popular?
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time and money.
　Running into a place like this is like asking to be killed ......!
<Page57>
"It's been a long time.
　Eighteen hours later, I finally caught you.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page58>
"Oh, you ----"
"What?
"You're definitely ----.
<Page59>
"Yeah. That's the woman you killed yesterday.
　I'm glad you remember me.
　Lie or not, I didn't want to hear it.
<Page60>
"Don't be ridiculous, a dead man can't be alive!"
"Yes, but it's not that surprising, is it?
　It's just that he was killed and then brought back to life.
<Page61>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.

　In other words, you've recovered from near death?　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page63>
"---" Don't be ridiculous!
　No one can come back to life after being dismembered like that. ......
<Page64>
"Yes. Because I'm not human.
"What about -----?
　The meaning of the woman's words was, well, too simple to be interpreted differently.
<Page65>
I'm not a human being.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the web site and see what you can find.
<Page66>
"You're not ...... human, are you?"
"Of course not. You will find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.

　I'm not sure what to say.
　If there is such a thing, it is just a completely different creature that resembles a human being.
<Page67>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　Even if you stop the root of the breath, it does not matter.
　Even if you tear it apart, it will come back together and start moving.
　A thing that cannot be called a human being in the shape of a person...
<Page68>
"----, is..."
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page69>
"...... what the hell is that?"
　It's so bad that it's not even funny.
　There are some things that go together so well that they can't be laughed at.
<Page70>
　Because, sure enough.
　If this woman is not a human being, then it might make sense that she is still alive when she should have been killed.
<Page71>
"Ha ......, ha, ha ......."
　The core of my ...... head is calming down.
　I remember the words of a man who saved me when I was a child.
　For now, take a good look.
　It's a situation that you have to think about a lot afterwards, this is.
<Page72>
You said, "...... you're not human.
　What are you then, my dear?"
<Page73>
"Me?#I'm a vampire, they call me.
　To put it simply, I'm a monster that lives off of human blood."
<Page74>
　...... Good.
　You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
<Page75>
　I know that I know it as knowledge.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It was created by the novelist Bram Stoker. It is a "non-dying" monster in the form of a human that is fictionalized in the Western world.
<Page76>
　Next, above all, the way it is can be seen by the name alone.
　A blood-sucking demon. Because it calls itself a demon, it is natural that it is not a human.
<Page77>
"So, vampires, it is...
　You can find a lot of people who are interested in this type of product.

　I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.
<Page80>
"Go to .......
　What does this monster want with me?
<Page81>
　I'm not sure why the woman backed down.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the web site and see what you can find.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page82>
"I was surprised. Have you forgotten what you did to me yesterday?
　You killed me, a complete stranger, in pieces the moment you saw me. What do you want with me, you're so used to it."
<Page83>
　The woman seems to be more dumbfounded than angry .......
　But now I feel the same way.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're going to be doing and how you're going to do it.
<Page84>
"Hey. I'm listening, homicidal maniac.
"...... Yeah, I'm listening. I'm just trying to wrap my head around the fact that I've had some pretty bad luck.
　I'm sorry, but I need you to shut up.
<Page85>
　I'd like to hit something.
　If not, you might even commit suicide.
<Page86>
　This is the time when you realize how bad your luck is.
　There was a woman who suddenly wanted to kill for no reason.
　I let my momentum get the better of me and killed her.
<Page87>
　The memory after that is vague, and when I turned my back on it as a dream, it turned out to be true, and in addition, the person I killed was not human.
　I've always said that I was defective and unfit, but compared to this situation, I'm pretty normal. ......!
<Page88>
　After that, I was in a lot of pain and desperation.
　But when I decided to make amends in my own way.
　The person you killed wasn't even human!
<Page89>
"------ hahaha"
　You can't help but laugh.
　It's not all bad though .......
<Page90>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your vacation.

<Page92>
　In the event that you're looking for the best way to get the most out of your business, you'll want to take a look at the following.
　I'm not sure if it's just bad luck, but it's probably very bad luck.
　If this is so ridiculous, I'm not the only one who's crazy.
<Page93>
"...... Okay, I'm calm.
　You've got something to say, right?　Complain, complain, complain, complain, complain.
<Page94>
"I've got a lot to say, but ...... you're a strange one. What's with the attitude in front of the vampire?
"I'm sorry, I'm trying really hard to be nice. ...... If I didn't, I might kill myself."

　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page102>
"I'm asking if you're sorry for killing me. And I said, if you're sorry, I'll forgive you.
　You seem like a terrible liar for a human being."
<Page103>
"You're sorry for ...... me?
"Yeah. If you say you're sorry, that's fine by me.
<Page104>
　---I can't believe it.
<Page105>
　It's not about forgiving or not forgiving the person who killed you, it's about...
　I'm not sure what to do with it.
<Page106>
"I'm sorry. I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one who has a problem with this.
　Come on, answer quickly. Are you feeling sorry for yourself or not?

<Page110>
　My throat tightens.
　Don't say that, I fear.
　But...
<Page111>
　...... But you can't avoid it.
　You can't avoid it.
　There must have been someone who believed in you that way.
<Page112>
　If you want to be normal.
　From the sins you've committed.
　From the things that you've done.
　From the sins you've committed, from the things you've done...

　It's a violence that can't be measured any further than that.
<Page118>
"So... you can have your revenge on me.
　...... I didn't run away because I was afraid of you. I was only running away from my own actions."
　He kept his head down.
　You will find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page119>
　You can find a lot more information on this topic at .......
　It's like I've been in a dream since yesterday.
<Page120>
　A dream of the tentative beginning before the end.
　The escape from reality that I kept running away from my own vileness.
　And now, I'm finally getting what I deserve.

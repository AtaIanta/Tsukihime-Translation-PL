　I was awakened by Jade's voice.
　Since then---after returning to the mansion, I must have retreated to my room to sleep.
　I sigh at the headache that echoes from ...... my eyeballs to my brain.
　It doesn't matter, but it's also a habit.
　He reached under his pillow and put on his glasses.

"'Shiki-sama,......, what is it about you that makes you feel so unwell?
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that. Good morning, Jade."
<Page3>
　It's a good idea to get up out of bed.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.

"I'll be right there.　Don't worry, I'll be right there."
"......... Yes, sir. I'll be waiting for you.

　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　Check your phone. I'm not sure what to do. The day of the week is Monday.
　Incredibly, it seems that the whole day after returning home on Saturday night, he was resting in bed. He must have been exhausted after a long day.
　I changed into my school uniform and headed for the cafeteria.
<Page6>
　After breakfast, I stopped by the living room.
　As usual, Akiba and Amber were in the living room.
"''Good morning.''
　I sat on the sofa as it was and looked at the clock for no reason.

"'...... brother?　You see, it's good that you're up early.
You know you have school today, right?"
"Yeah...?　Oh, I see.
　I have to go to school, don't I?
<Page8>
　I forgot.
　I vaguely thought that since I had nothing left to do, I'd just have to do the rest of the nooks and crannies.
<Page9>
"'...... I've got my own life, you know. If there's nothing to do, I'll go to school anyway."
"Brother ......?"

　I feel like I've done something like this before.
　As a matter of course, there is no one there.
<Page13>
"------"
　---What am I doing here, I wonder?
　I'm not sure what I'm doing here, taking a class or something.
　I'm not even looking for him, I'm just a normal student again.
<Page14>
　But I have no way or means to find Alcade.
　I'm sure he's gone, so there's no chance of me finding him.
　So, really.
　I've lost Alcade...
<Page15>
"............"

　I went down the deserted corridor.
　The blazing evening sun has dyed the corridor all red.
<Page2>
　The autumn sun is a vine.
　In less than a few minutes, the world will change. Night is coming.
　The sky I look up at is already dark.
　The borderline between black and red.
　I am in an ambiguous time that is neither day nor night.
<Page3>
"Ah..."
　I looked up at the sky from the corridor and noticed.
　The moon had already appeared in the sky.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page4>
"............"
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page5>
　The moon is silvery.
　It's a beautiful, glasswork-like relief.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
<Page6>
　I saw such a moon when I was a child.
　In the coma.#I was staring at it#I'm sure you'll agree.
<Page7>
　I'm not sure what to say. ----
"I'm not sure what to say.
　Suddenly, the old wound in my chest hurt.
<Page8>
　I'm not sure what to make of this. ----
　I'm not sure what to say.
　The blood vessels in the body are activated, and breathing is no longer constant.
<Page9>
　It's a great way to get the most out of your time. ----
　It's a good idea to have a hand on your chest.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page10>
　I'm not sure what to say. ----
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. --"
　The breathing is disordered.
　The chill that runs down your spine is like ice.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page11>
　---I'm not sure what to do.
　---It's so bad.
　---.
　---...and...
　------ cut, hmm.
　In the midst of the heartbeat, something hard sounded.
<Page12>
"Ah ------"
　Someone is coming.
　From the back of the corridor, a long shadow crawled on the floor.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page13>
　---It's not a good idea.
　It's not the same as the threat of a blasting Vrove.
　The potential fear that comes not from the outside world, but from within, pulses through the body.
<Page14>
　The flash that drives the skull.
　This sense of pain. This sense of crisis is for yourself.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier. ----
<Page15>
"---,------
　Stop your feet.
　It's already too late to escape. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page16>
　The human figure comes.
　A tall man.
　It's hard to see, because there are surprisingly few "lines" that flutter about the body.
　In the meantime, the "point" pulsating in the center is a disaster.
　It's like a heart, beating, beating, beating, beating, beating, beating.
<Page17>
"-- -------------------"
　The breathing stopped.
　You can find a number of questions intermingled.
　I don't know any of those figures.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I can't help but think it looks like someone else.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　The man is getting closer.
　Soon, I can see his face clearly.
<Page18>
"-- -------------------"
　Who does he look like?
　I'm not sure what to say.
　Who do I look like?
　Who am I forgetting ------?
<Page19>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　It is still far away. You can't even see the face in the red slanting sun.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page20>
"I think. The life of a man is like a book without a subject."
　It was a cheerful voice.
　It was calm, yet it sent chills down my spine.
　I don't know of any other sound so disgusting that it makes me want to vomit.
<Page21>
"The book is so small you can hold it in one hand.
　　The paper is so fragile that it is hazy with age.
　　It gets wet. Burned by fire. Cut down by our own hands.
　　The record of the past is an illusion that can always be falsified.
　　But..."
<Page22>
　I hold up the knife.
　He drops his back. I look at the distance.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time.
　But reason is too stubborn.
　I can't switch my mind to killing him for just one breath.
<Page23>
"You, as an individual, are but an incomplete text.
　　Life is too ambiguous.
　　Are you aware of that?　Tono... Shiki."
"Ha!"
<Page24>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your business.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page25>
"------"
　But still, it was too slow.
　If we could close in on him in a single breath.
　He had slipped behind me in the blink of an eye.
<Page26>
"------"
　Not in time.
　The man struck my hand and took my knife.
　His eyes glowed blue as he stared straight down the line of my body.
<Page27>
　It's like I'm the only one in slow motion.
　He fishes the corners of his mouth in amusement.
"That's too bad.
　You're not the only one who gets to see death."
　He swung my knife down at my body.
<Page28>
　My spine is frozen.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
"-------- ---I'm not sure what to say.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page29>
　The body collapses.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　In the middle of that.
　It's a good idea to look up and see the man's face.
<Page30>
"------"
　It becomes pitch black in front of my eyes.
　The man's face. I don't know this man's face.
　And yet, I remember him. I remember the flow of this blood.
<Page31>
　Because this guy...
　That summer day, in front of me.
　He's the future of the boy who was covered in blood in front of me that summer day.
<Page32>
　I fell to the floor with a thud.
　Strangely, no pain, no bleeding.
　The knife is still in my chest.
　However, his body temperature is dropping. My consciousness gradually fades. The freedom of my body is disappearing.
<Page33>
"The debt you were killed for, I've certainly returned it. You no longer have any regrets.
　It's time to burn the book, Tono-- Shiki."
<Page34>
　The man is sending the words to the void.
　Ahh... why did I forget about it until now?
　When I was a child.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page35>
　We were always... always together.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page36>
"Si ---- ki."
"I'm not sure what to say. It really is a long time.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　The owner of this body, Tono Shiki, has just disappeared.#I'm not sure what to do.
<Page37>
　The man speaks. The name of the man with the same sound, but different words.
　Tono Shiki.
　Shiki. Shiki. Akiba. Shiki. Shiki. Akiba. Shiki.
　Such a trace of graffiti comes back to my mind.
<Page38>
"You, you, you..."
"That's right. I'm your objective.
　A vampire reincarnated in this body. The princess's adversary.
　And that's just for tonight."
<Page39>
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.

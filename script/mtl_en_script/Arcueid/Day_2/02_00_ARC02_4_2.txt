　Let's pay a visit to Amber's room.
　On the way to the washroom, I had a good idea where Amber's room was.
<Page2>
　I move toward the back of the corridor on the first floor of the west wing.
　The direction is the opposite of the lobby, and the kitchen should be at the end of this corridor.
　It seems that Amber has a room in the small room in front of the kitchen.
<Page3>
"I'm not sure if this is the right room for you.
　I knock on the door.
"Amber, are you there?"
<Page4>
"Yes, please wait a moment.
　A cheerful voice comes from inside the room.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
<Page5>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　What's wrong with you, at this hour?"
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea. ...... Actually, I was wondering if you could show me the TV.
"Yes?
<Page6>
"Oh, you know, this house doesn't have a TV, right?
　I've been living in a normal house for a while now, and it's my routine to watch TV before going to bed, and I don't feel comfortable without it. ......
<Page7>
　The more you say ......, the more you realize that you are doing something incredibly stupid.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page8>
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page9>
"I'm sure you're right.
　I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm sure the air in this house was suddenly heavy, right?
<Page10>
"I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
"I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but I think it's a good idea.
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand what I mean.
<Page11>
"I've never told anyone about it.
<Page12>
"That's very good. I'm not sure what to say, but I'm sure you'll understand.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page13>
"It's a good thing there are no people around.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　I'm not sure what to do.
"I'm not sure what to do.
<Page14>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life. This is the only place that is completely built in the Japanese style.
　In the meantime, the other half of the room is a Western-style but simple structure, reminiscent of a school infirmary rather than a room in a Western-style building.
<Page15>
"I'm going to go make some tea.
　I'll go make some tea.
　I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.
<Page16>
"............"
　It's a good idea to take a look at a few of the things that are available in the market.
<Page17>
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　The chests in the back have only small drawers.
　I'm sure you'll be able to find something that fits in the palm of your hand.
<Page18>
"That chest of drawers could possibly be .......
　I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page19>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for before you buy.
　I'm sure you'll agree with me. I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
<Page20>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　Amber might have been watching TV a while ago.
<Page21>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm sure you'll like it.
"Oh, thank you, don't mind me.
<Page22>
"I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you any hospitality.
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page23>
"I'm sure you'll agree.
　I'm not sure if you've seen this before.
"I don't have a specific time, but basically I watch the news on .......
<Page24>
"I see.
　You're so calm, I thought you might be reading after dinner.
<Page25>
"Unfortunately, I don't have such an auspicious mind.
　I'm often seen as a diligent student, but I'm a lazy bum at heart.
　I guess the glasses make me look serious.
<Page26>
"You're right!
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　In fact, when I greeted you yesterday, I was surprised in my heart.
"I'm not sure.　Why is that?
<Page27>
"You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page28>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　...... I see.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page29>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　You can say that my eyesight is bad, but my eyesight is better than average. It's not that I lost my eyesight by studying too much. Oh, ......, you had an image of being intelligent, did I disillusion you?
<Page30>
"No, not at all.
　I'm not sure what to do with it.
　I'm glad that you are as energetic as I thought you were.
<Page31>
"So, is that so? Thank you for that.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page32>
"I'm sorry.
　I came here to watch the news, but I ended up chatting with you.
　Amber turns on the TV.
<Page33>
　The image appeared on the monitor.
　The time was past 9:30.
　The news program was not a cheerful one for the tea room, but had shifted to a social one reporting serious information.
<Page34>
"'Oh my. Another street murderer?
　The news featured a series of street murders.
　This is the first time I've ever seen such a thing.
<Page35>
　It's a simple thing to do.
It's a murderous act of indiscriminately abducting young women walking around late at night, killing them, and finally extracting their blood.
　The number of victims has already reached eight, and the police's ability to investigate the case, which continues to lag behind, has been called into question.
<Page36>
　No further details have been reported in the media.
　The common denominator of the victims, the exact cause of death, etc., are blurred in the news, with only the expression "blood was taken out.
　I guess it's called "information control" to prevent copycat acts by amusing criminals.
<Page37>
"It's a scary story. I wonder what the policeman is doing.
"Hmmm, ...... is it because the crime was so sudden that they can't pinpoint a motive?　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. You can't find the culprit without a motive .......
<Page38>
"It's not just the luck of the people who were attacked,......, but also the luck of the perpetrators who have no witnesses?
"Yes, well. Otherwise, it would be strange that the killer has not been found for almost two weeks.
<Page39>
"I don't know. If you're well-prepared, it's not so strange, is it?
　I can only imagine, but the more murders there are, the more evidence they leave behind.
<Page40>
"If there are eight missing people, the evidence doesn't stack up, but if there are eight bodies found, there should be enough circumstantial evidence.
　The reason why the culprit has not been caught is because the culprit has created a 'reason' for not being caught.
<Page41>
"------"
　...... It was unexpected.
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but I'm sure it's a good idea.

<Page44>
　...... Amber talks about a disturbing topic with a smile.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page45>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　Don't you think it's a little scary for a young girl like you?
<Page46>
"No, no, it's okay.
　I'm sure you'll be fine. If you don't go out at night, you won't see them.
<Page47>
　Amber's thoughts are really clear.
　It's too graphic a topic to be dismissed as such, but maybe that's just the way it is with incidents we learn about on the news.
<Page48>
"I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
　If I want to watch it again, I'll come back.
<Page49>
"Yes, I'm looking forward to seeing it."
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.

"I'll be back. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page51>
"............"
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
　In addition to the 8 o'clock curfew, there is an unspoken rule in this mansion that you are not allowed to leave your room past 10 o'clock.
<Page52>
"I'm sure you'll agree. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
　...... Well, that's not surprising.

<Page53>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page54>
　...... I'm tired of the unfamiliar atmosphere of the mansion.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

　Ooooooooohhh.
　--- Like a wave, I hear the voice of something.
<Page2>
　Ooooooooohhh.
　---an animal's howl. It's thin and high for a wild dog.
<Page3>
　Ooooooooon.
　---It echoes in my eardrums. Is it barking at the moon?
<Page4>
　Ooooohhh.
　---A disgusting smell. The roar of this beast gives me a headache.
<Page5>
　Ooooooohhh.
　---The sound doesn't stop.
　　　　Like a bullet shot into the skull.
　　　　Like a bullet shot into the skull, it reverberates caracara.
<Page6>
　Ooooooohhh.
　Ooooohhhhh.
　Ooooooooooooon. --------
<Page7>
"...... Oh my god, it's so loud!"
　I open my eyes while putting on my glasses.
　You can still hear the dog barking from outside the window.
<Page8>
　The clock has just struck eleven in the evening.
　It's not just a matter of disturbing your sleep.
<Page9>
"Damn ...... what's with the whining ......?"
　The dog's howling can be heard from outside the mansion.
　I'm not going to be able to ...... sleep like this.
<Page10>
"You can't ...... help it.
　You can't call the police and expect them to take care of a noisy dog.
<Page11>
　You can get out of bed and change back into your school uniform.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the most recent information about the company.
<Page12>
　I left the house.
　The night is frozen, everything has stopped.
<Page13>
　The moon is hidden in the clouds.
　Even the light from the electric lights seems to have hardened like paint dropped on a canvas.
<Page14>
　Ooooohhhhh.
　............ Ooooohhhhh. ............
　........................ Ooooohhh... ............
<Page15>
　Oddly enough, the howl sounded weaker out there.
　Or is the howl just starting to fade?
　Either way, it doesn't matter.
　This sound is more painful to my brain and eyes than it is to my ears.
　It is a physiological disgust that activates the heart just by listening to it.
<Page16>
"Shut up!"
　My legs are heavy as I walk away.
　The sensation of the fingertips is uncertain.
　I'm not sure.
　I noticed that my breath was white.
<Page17>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　The illusion that everything has ceased.
　The only activity in the stopped world is your own shadow priest.
<Page18>
".................."
　For some reason, I'm thirsty.
　It's a great way to get to know the people around you.
　In the event that you have any kind of questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page19>
"------What?"
　My consciousness stops.
　I'm not sure if it's because I've never seen anything like it.
　I've never seen anything like it before (and I never would have if I were normal).
　A strange sight.
<Page20>
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　A melting dog.
　What is that thing?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　A long blade pointed at me.
　What is that?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　A melted howl.
　What is that?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　The long blade that sticks.
　What is that?
<Page21>
　A scream as if I've lost my mind.
　Or a strong wind.
　After the wave that tears the eardrum runs through, the dog's cry and the dog's figure are already gone.
　As if they had never existed from the beginning.
　Without a trace, it melted and disappeared.
<Page22>
　---So, is it an illusion?
　Is what I'm seeing now a hallucination or a dream?
<Page23>
　---Then, is that an illusion?
　Under the lampposts, which seem to have been cut out of the darkness, there stands a thing that I do not understand.
<Page24>
　Is that a coat ......?
　A person figure wearing a thick coat does not seem to have noticed me standing there.
<Page25>
"------"
　I'm thirsty. The whole body is sweating.
　The night air is moist and tangled in the skin.
　It's not like there's anything wrong with it.
　But everything feels so heavy, like you're at the bottom of the ocean...
<Page26>
"[zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00]
　I heard the sound of a distant foreign country.
　I'm about to lose consciousness to dizziness.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't fall over.
　And---
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page27>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page28>
"..............."
　I can't hear you howling anymore.
　I left the phantom as if it were a ...... fever.
<Page29>
　I came back to the ...... room.
　There was no sign that Akiha and the others were awake.
　It seems that I was the only one who could not stand that dog's howling.
<Page30>
"----- Gu."
　I wonder what it is.
　My head still hurts.
<Page31>
"That ...... why am I shaking?
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out.
　It's like having your spinal cord ripped out and a pillar of ice inserted in its place.
<Page32>
"-----"
　I'm not sure what to do.
　...... Is it the usual anemia?
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
<Page33>
"------"
　You can see that line even though you are wearing glasses.
<Page34>
"Ugh,.........!
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page35>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to do. In conjunction with the dizziness of anemia, I feel like I'm about to vomit out the things in my stomach.
<Page36>
"...... You're lying. What's going on here?
　I don't know.
　It's a good idea to keep your eyes open as long as you can.
<Page37>
"It's a dream.
　I managed to fall into bed.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money. It's the quickest way to deny what you see.
<Page38>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. ......
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's just a matter of falling asleep like a puppet with a broken string.

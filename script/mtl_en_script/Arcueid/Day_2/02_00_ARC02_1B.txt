　In the living room, there were Akiba and Jade.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page2>
"I'm not sure what to say. Good morning, Akiba.
"Good morning, brother.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation. I'll just say that I didn't sleep well on my first day.
<Page3>
"............
　It's a great way to get a good night's sleep.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with your family.
<Page4>
"I'm sure you'll agree. I'm not sure what to do.
　I'll have another cup as well.
"I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to make of it.
"Ah, yes. Then just one.
<Page5>
　And so the indescribable morning hours began.
"...............
"..............."

　It's a good idea to take a sip of the dark red tea without saying a word.#No, wait, what is this taste ......?
<Page6>
"It's very tasty,.......
　It's bitter yet sweet, complex yet refreshing on the throat, and the aroma is just like Christmas ......!
<Page7>
　I don't know what I'm saying, but that's how shocked I was.
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why I've been so impressed with your work.
<Page8>
"'This morning is Mariage's Esprit de Noel.
　The most famous tea shop is in England, but this is a famous shop in France. It was founded around 1850, and only recently ...... landed in Japan, about fifteen years ago, so it is not a major player, but there is no problem with the quality.
<Page9>
"It's hard to evaluate the ...... Christmas expression because it's too vague, but it strangely conveys the nuance.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page10>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. Did you learn that fine quality leaves have a value equal to gold?"
<Page11>
　It's a dominant, supercilious look at the pathetic primitives.
　Even the gesture of placing the teacup on the plate is graceful.
<Page12>
"Stick with ......."
　But, to my chagrin, it is true.
　This is the real tea,......, the tea that I used to drink in the afternoon,......, and this will certainly happen in one or two trade companies. If there were such a thing in a time when entertainment was scarce, even I would be desperate to order it,.......
<Page13>
　And so the time passes, about 10 minutes.
"..............."
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　To be honest, it was awkward to say the least.
<Page14>
　Still, it was not a bad time for me.
　You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　I wonder if this is a relief ....... You can't help but be happy now that Akiha is in front of you no matter what.
<Page15>
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you're going to need to be able to pay for it.
<Page16>
I'm not sure what to do.
　Ransatsu, Rambou, and finally, Ransin.
　Daikaizou ni jigoku ikiーー!
　Through the wall, a humming with no tempo or shit approaches.
<Page17>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　If you are the head of the family, good morning, Chao Chao!
<Page18>
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why I've been so impressed with your work.
<Page19>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　The hair is unusually long and put together in an unimportant way.
　It looks like there is no makeup, lips are strangely glossy.
　The color of the hair is blonde and reddish, it seems to be a foreigner from the fact that it is also tall.
<Page20>
　It's also a great way to get to know the people around you.
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. ...... If it weren't for that strangely fitting white coat.
<Page21>
"...... Good morning, Dr. Arakku.
　What can I do for you today? The regular checkup was supposed to be yesterday.
<Page22>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　When I was watching the sunset, I got frustrated, so I abandoned my research and ran out into the city. Well, to put it bluntly, I skipped out. That's why I came here in the morning to get some work done today!
　Oh, maid-chan, please give me some tea. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I think it's a good idea.
<Page23>
　The woman in the white coat strolled into the living room.
　Naturally, her eyes met mine as I sat on the sofa.
<Page24>
"I'm not sure what to say.　I'm not sure.　I'm not sure what to do.
　Oh?　Hmmm?　Mmmmmmmmm?"
<Page25>
　He looks at me intently.
　I'm not sure if you've been convinced by a lot of observation.#The woman smiled, and then...
<Page26>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　Wait, it's too good!
　What's this, the master has come up with a plan to kill me with laughter?　That's amazing! It's a dead mast and it's secreting A-10s!
　It's like Macbeth in this house!　You're going to kill me or be killed or something, you're going to tragedy!
<Page27>
　The woman is laughing with her stomach.
"..............."
　The only thing I can do is frown.
　What's with this high tension person? Akiha called him teacher, but .......
<Page28>
"I'm sure you'll agree.
　May I introduce you to my brother?"
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you're going to need to be able to pay for it.
<Page29>
"It's a good idea.　I'm not sure what to do.　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll do it.
　Shiki-chan is not interested in the situation of a stranger like me, right?　I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page30>
　Makihisa Kun ......?
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page31>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to make of it.
But I had a connection with Makihisa-kun.
"If you have nowhere else to go, why don't you come live with us?"
　He was so cool about it!
　But alas, Makihisa wasn't really my type, so I simply turned him down, and now I'm friends with the head of the family?
　Is he your friend now?"
<Page32>
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page33>
"I'm not sure what to say. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
<Page34>
"What? I hate it when you call me that.
　Hakaase. If you don't call me Dr. Araguru with affection and affection, I'll cry!
<Page35>
　I'm not crying, I'm laughing at you.
　...... But.

"Oh, nice sugar!　I'm not sure what to make of this.　I'm getting into it!
<Page40>
"I'm off for a routine checkup!　There's something wrong with the air conditioning in the bathrooms, isn't there?　I know, I know, I know. I'll check it out quickly and add some ion clusters to it.
<Page41>
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.　I'm not sure what to make of it. ......
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
<Page42>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm sure there's a lot more to come, but...

<Page43>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
"..............."
"..............."
　An indescribable silence enveloped the living room.
<Page44>
"Hey, Akiba.
"I don't know much about Dr. Arakku, either.
　It's not that I'm not a fan of his work, but he's a great guy. I heard that his father was a very useful architect. According to him, though, the building business is a sideline.
<Page45>
　Akiha declares crisply.
"What's that guy?" I was the first to ask the question.
"I'm not going to accept any more questions from you.
<Page46>
"If you'll excuse me. Akiba-sama, it's time for you to go to school. ......
Hmm?　There's something tense about the atmosphere.
　Hahaha. Did you immediately frighten Shiki-san by saying an unreasonable request from this morning?
<Page47>
"You. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your money. You will find a lot of things that you can do.
<Page48>
　Amber is impressed by Akiha's manner of speaking.
　It's only the second day, but I think I'm starting to understand the distance between these two.
<Page49>
"So, I'm heading to school.
　Brother. As I told you last night, you must strictly observe the curfew. Did you see the news last night?
"No, I didn't. Someone took my cell phone. Unreasonably."
<Page50>
"I see. Then I'll have the morning paper ready in the living room tomorrow.
　You'd better get up early and look over the day's news.
<Page51>
　That's it.
　This was the kind of ironclad attitude that would bounce back my small amount of sarcasm in no time.
<Page52>
"According to the news, the body of a vagrant was found at the north exit of Soya Station last night. It is reported that he froze to death due to malnutrition or died of exhaustion due to blood loss.
<Page53>
"Whatever the truth is, it seems that the security in the downtown area is not good these days. It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web.
　As soon as school is over, please make sure to return to the mansion before the sun goes down."
<Page54>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　But ...... before the sun goes down means that you should be back by six o'clock. It's a good idea to take a look at your own personal life.

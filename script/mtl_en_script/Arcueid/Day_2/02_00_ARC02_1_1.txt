　It's been three minutes since HR time.
　The replacement teacher for Tohyama has not arrived at all.
<Page2>
　The classroom was buzzing and order was breaking down.
　To be more specific, the classroom was full of people.
<Page3>
　Everyone in the class was thinking that if they were going to be left like this, they should just play until first period started.
　One more minute. Let's just hold out for one more minute.
　After that, we are free to do whatever we want.
<Page4>
"Yes, everyone, quietly, quietly.
　Let's start the HR!
<Page5>
　The buzzing air calmed down instantly.
　The teacher who walked into the classroom was a person I had never seen before, or rather, a person I had never expected to see, who was not Japanese by any stretch of the imagination, but rather looked like a university student.
<Page6>
"The teacher was not Japanese.　What is this atmosphere?
　You've all got your hands full. ......
　I'm not sure if I'm a viper or not.
　I'm sorry, that's a minor metaphor. I don't know... I think it's a Japanese term for a girl with a heart attack.　But sir, my name is not Sadako."
<Page7>
　Isn't that metaphor already old-fashioned?　I frowned.
　The mysterious woman, on the other hand, stands on the podium without a hint of concern and clears her throat deliberately.
<Page8>
"It's nice to meet you. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page9>
"It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time at the gym.
　My favorite food is Mont Blanc.
<Page10>
"------"
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time and money.
　I, too, was a little taken aback.
<Page11>
　It's not that Noel is a stunningly beautiful woman.
　I'm sure you'll be able to tell.
　It is a little bit older sister.
　She is filled with a charm that cannot be put into words.
　Anyway, there was something like a fluffy whip that stimulated the adoration of high school boys at first sight.
<Page12>
"Question!　How old are you, Noel-sensei?
"And where do you live?
"I want to know how you spend your holidays and what your hobbies are!
"Who's your favorite type of high school student?
<Page13>
　"Who is your favorite high school type?
　These topics are usually discussed in an anonymous forum, but it seems that the guys who were hit by the wink couldn't even wait.
<Page14>
　The girls look at them coldly and say, "Boys are dumb," but it seems that the scorn of their classmates, who are tired of seeing them, doesn't matter to them.
<Page15>
"Thanks for the flying fish reaction.
　I live in a rented apartment two stations away, my favorite type of guy is a literary type with a mature head, and my hobby is helping out at Sunday church. My hobby is helping out at the church on Sundays. It's a church in the next town over, so if you're interested, I'd be happy if you came to pray.
<Page16>
"Church?　What are you, a sister?　You're a sister as a hobby?
"Yes. It's not so rare in my country. Well, I'm still just a volunteer, solving confessions of troubled lambs.
<Page17>
"Oh, ...... oh, ......."
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page18>
　On the other hand, a group of girls were silently playing with their mobile devices.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page19>
I'm not sure what to make of that.
I'm not sure if she's that beautiful or not.
I'd like to see a half-Frenchman do it somewhere else.
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page20>
　...... There you have it.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page21>
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　In other words, it's a primitive age of junior high school where people curse each other, saying "boys are terrible" and "girls are unfair.
<Page22>
　Looking at such a situation with a gentle smile.
"Mmmm. I wonder if their brains are up to it.
　The new teacher makes a comment that is out of line.
<Page23>

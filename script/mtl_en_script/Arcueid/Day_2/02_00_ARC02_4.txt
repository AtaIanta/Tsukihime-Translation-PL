　The ...... neck is strangely hot. I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure if it's because of that. It's a good idea to have a good idea of where you're going.
<Page2>
　The night covers the city like water that has leaked out.
　The clamor that cannot be compared with the morning.
　The headlights of the car which goes to and fro.
　The crowd of people who are swept out of the station or swallowed.
　The number of school uniforms has decreased.
　The school uniforms have been reduced in number, and people dressed in colorful clothes are walking around.
<Page3>
"'------'
　I let my body stand up from sitting on the bench.
　It's time to go.
　I have no reason to go at all, but I turned to the downtown area.
<Page4>
"------
　The main street turns into a side street.
　It's not a road, but a blind spot between buildings.
<Page5>
　There are no people around.
　There is no noise.
　There is no sign of life.
　Just a rustling sound from the back there.
<Page6>
　The light of the vending machine is dazzling.
　Too much civilized equipment that is disproportionate to this place.
　It's too bright, so I pass it by.
　I turn my feet to the darker, more appropriate darkness of the night.
<Page7>
　To ...... a narrower, more secluded darkness.
　I put my hand on the rusty iron fence.
　If you open this and dive deep, you'll find yourself in a place where...
<Page8>
"Hey, you there."
"---What?"
<Page9>
　I was stopped in my tracks.
　I woke up with a light spark of dizziness.
　I ...... don't know what that means.
　Why come to a place like this?
　Why did I try to go this far back, I ......?
<Page10>
"I'm sorry. Do you have a hundred yen on you?
　When I turned around, there was a girl I didn't know in front of the vending machine.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page11>
"..............."
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page12>
"Thank you. Thank you for your help.
　A hundred yen is put into the vending machine. A button is pressed.
　The girl took out the can that fell out.
　The girl took out the can that fell out and frowned boringly.
<Page13>
"I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to go for a walk at this hour.
　Aren't your folks waiting for you?"
"Oh, ......!"
<Page14>
　I was told to look at the phone.
　The clock is mercilessly 7:40...oh no, there are only 20 minutes left until curfew!
<Page15>
　I rushed out of the alleyway.
　---And.
"Please wait."
　The girl stops me again.
<Page16>
"What?　I'm sorry, but I have to hurry.
　The juice can was thrown with a heave.
　I rushed to catch it, but wasn't this the one she had bought?
<Page17>
"You can have it.
"What's with the ......?
"None of them tasted good to me."
<Page18>
　The girl walked past me with a sullen look on her face.
<Page19>
"I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're going to be doing in the future.

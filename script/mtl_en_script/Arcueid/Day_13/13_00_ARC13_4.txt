　In the event you're not sure what to do, you can always ask for help.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your day.
<Page5>
　If the body moves with this, it doesn't matter if you crush the left hand with the nail.
　If you have a right hand with a knife, that's fine.
<Page6>
　I go through the corridor and run up the stairs.
　The sound is close. The source is probably the third floor.
　You can catch up with them in a few minutes.
　If I catch up, I have a chance. Alcade knows my eyes. He's a calm and rational guy when it comes to fighting. If he knows I'm coming, he'll use it to good effect. He'll be able to use it effectively if he sees that I'm coming, just like he did with Vroob. As long as he can hold off Rohr, the rest is mine. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
<Page7>
　So...so, you can still ......!
<Page8>
"Ha-ha-ha-ha... ---!"
　I reached the third floor.
　The scars that are running on the wall that is wall, the end of the corridor as it is---.

　In the middle of the corridor.
　Two figures face each other, keeping their distance.
<Page12>
　At the back of the corridor, in front of the school building on the other side, stands Roa with a sense of comfort.
<Page13>
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.

　---But, what the hell was that?
　I don't know. I don't know any Alcade like that.
<Page15>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　The body on the verge of weakening and shattering.
　That night. The beautiful flower that I saw on the top floor of the hotel is no longer there to be seen...
<Page16>
"Alcade ----!"
　I'm going to start running. I don't care what Roa looks like.
　I don't even know what traps are in this corridor.
　You'll be able to get to Alcade as quickly as possible.
<Page17>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　As he knelt down, Alcade glared at me.
<Page18>
"..................!?"
　The body is not moving,......!
　The moment you look into Alcade's eyes, your body will not move as if it were petrified,......!

<Page29>
"I'm not sure what to make of that. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.

　It is the very right of creation. No matter how skilled you are in magic, humans are far behind you."
<Page32>
"But... at the same time, you can't interfere directly with humans either.
　But at the same time you can't interfere with us directly, because we've evolved to be prosperous, learned, independent, wise animals, and that's a different category than this planet.

　But no matter how much we learn about the mysteries, no matter how long we live, we will never experience the end of nothingness, the essential death.
<Page38>
"By refusing death, you have gained great power, but you have also created weakness.
　You who avoided death, and I who accepted death.
　This is the reason why it is so important for you to have a good idea of what you are doing.
　I am still a man, living in the age of man. You, who are nothing more than a ghost out of time, have no right to punish me."

　What's left of her, what's barely there, will be lost.

　I was not mistaken---my theory was not mistaken!"
<Page50>
　The vampire screams with joy, suffering from despair.
　As if ...... hating it.
　She erased the winged insect in front of her, as if to dispel it.
<Page51>
　When she opened her eyes, Roa's body did not exist.
　It was distorted, mutilated, compressed.
　The corridor regained its appearance of reality.
<Page52>
　It seems that the current scene was only for a moment.
　There was no change in the corridor.
　Only Roa's ankle remains there.
<Page53>
　---But.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page54>
"I'm not sure what to say. It's the canopy that covers the void that is beyond human knowledge.

　I'm not sure what to make of this.

"But the progress of magic is no match for the work of the sorcerer.
　In this way, the automatic chanting that can be triggered even if the magician perishes has reached the point of perfection in recent years."

　Your voyage has been pointless for eight hundred years.
　Because to me, physical death is just a rite of passage.
　Even if this body dies here, the loa will hatch back into the human world.
　You should know that. I am the perfect immortal. I know. Death. The darkness. The emptiness I have passed through dozens of times. ......!"
<Page59>
"It's dangerous. It's a good thing you chose tonight after all. If it wasn't for the full moon, I wouldn't have been able to revive her from her ankles.
<Page60>
"And you, Princess. You can't revive me from this wound.
　My claws are just as capable as that man's."

　Alquaid collapsed to the floor.
<Page64>
"This is the power I gained after experiencing death.
　It is ironic that I myself did not know how to use it.
　He was the one who taught me as a sample. Once you get the hang of it, it's a piece of cake. I've seen a lot of death, and it's not hard for me to read the death of things.

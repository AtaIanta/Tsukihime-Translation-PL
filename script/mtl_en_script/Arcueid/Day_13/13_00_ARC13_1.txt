　It's a great way to make sure you get the most out of your time with your family.
　No, to be more precise, since a long time ago, I've always been a stranger to my family.
<Page2>
　I never wondered why.
　I found myself alone. There were people around me who looked like my parents, so I just tried my best to be their child.
　I think an old house with a tatami room was my first home.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.
<Page3>
　There was a brother and sister about the same age in the ...... house.#I'm sure you'll agree.#　I think I was very close to them.
　I'm not sure if you've heard of it, but I'm sure you've heard of it.
　I tried my best.
　I tried my best to be a desirable family.
　I tried to believe that even though we were not related by blood, we were still parents and children.
<Page4>
　But it all ended too soon.
　There was a big accident and I was taken to the hospital.
　No one came to visit me, and my eyes went crazy.
　I was alone until then, and in the end, I was alone.
　I thought I'd just disappear.

<Page23>
"I'm sorry about that.
　I ...... lied to my brother a lot. This time, too, I knew ...... this would happen, but I lied and cheated my way through it.
<Page24>
"...... So you had a third child.
　But why did he do it?
<Page25>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with your family and friends. ...... Did you cease to exist in this Tono residence seven years ago?
　I don't remember for sure.
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where by and how to use the internet, you can call us at our own web site.
　We did that and played with Akiha, who would occasionally come outside under the watchful eye of her father.
<Page26>
　And yet, I don't remember anything else about him.
　Why did he disappear?
　The fact that his name was Shiki, just like mine.
　I've completely forgotten everything.

　Akiha was there, and I was there.
　In front of me, there was the corpse of another boy covered in blood.

　...... Wait. Surely that vampire was saying.
"I owe you a murder, and I have indeed returned it.
　That means that ----
<Page31>
"I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.
　You've killed him.
　That's why he suddenly disappeared, and I forgot the memories that were bad for me,......?
<Page32>
"Akiba, I'm ----
"No, you're not. My brother did not kill anyone.
　Your father ...... told Tono Makihisa to make you believe that.
"Father ......?"
<Page33>
　I'm not sure what to make of that,.......
　Why would my father tell me to do that,......?
<Page34>
"What do you mean by that?
　Does Akiba know everything ...... about what happened seven years ago, and about that Shiki, and about everything?
"...... Yes. I did not want my brother to remember about Shiki. If I could, I would have kept it out of my mind.
<Page35>
"...... But...#It's also the end of the line.
　It is impossible to conceal ...... it from the beginning.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the very best in the market.
<Page36>
"It's a good idea. You've heard that the Tono family is a special bloodline, right?　You won't believe it, but Tono's blood is mixed with non-human blood.
　...... At least, that's what my father taught me growing up, from an early age.
<Page37>
"Of course, I didn't believe it honestly.
　But then something happened that forced me to believe it.
　...... That was the accident seven years ago, when your brother was killed by Shiki.
"You're saying ...... I was killed by ...... Shiki?"
<Page38>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

<Page39>
"......The people in the Tono family have different blood inside them that increases as they age, depending on the individual. This blood is not a very good one.
　The different blood mixed with the Tono bloodline has a different survival instinct than people. If the human-like part is called reason, then the heterogeneous part is instinct, animal nature.
<Page40>
"'............... Akiba, that's...'
"...... I know. It's hard to believe, so please shut up and listen to me for now.
<Page41>
"But it's only when you're old that people with Tono's bloodline end up as people.
　There has never been an example of a person like my brother ...... Shiki being reversed at an early age."
<Page42>
"'It is said that the different abilities possessed by people in Tono differ from each other on an individual basis. There are those whose appearance does not change at all, and there are those whose body shape really changes.
　---Shiki was a typical example of the latter.
<Page43>
"The latter ...... means that the shape of the body changes ......?"
"...... Yes. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　But one day, without warning, it flipped.
　It was you, brother ......, who was attacked by Shiki at that time.
<Page44>
"Shiki attacked ...... me ......?"
　I'm not sure what to say.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page45>
"This is a great way to get the most out of your day.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　And then my father rushed in and stopped him.
<Page46>
"...... The only way to stop Shiki, who had lost all reason, was to choke him out. The head of the Tono family has a duty to deal with those of the clan who have been reversed in that way.
　So --- the bloody Shiki that my brother saw is probably the Shiki after being processed by my father."
<Page47>
"-------"
　I don't know, I can't remember.
　I'm not sure what to say. I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.
<Page48>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　In the memory that can no longer be retrieved, there is a certainty that I have cut off the life of something with my own hands.
　I don't care what anyone says, I feel like I killed a man in that forest...
<Page49>
"...... Fortunately, your brother miraculously survived.
　In the event you're not sure what you're looking for, there are a few things you can do.
"----"
<Page50>
"...... I was chosen as the head of the family because of this one incident.
　Those who have been reversed even once are not welcomed as the head of the family.
　Shiki is no longer the heir, and I, the only one who carries my father's blood, was raised as the head of the family."
<Page51>
　...... I see.
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
<Page52>
"I'm sorry. It's not right. I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm... well, I'm not normal, am I?
<Page53>
"...... I'm surprised.
　Brother, do you really believe this story ......?"
<Page54>
"You know what? You're not going to be able to lie to me about this, and I'm used to this kind of talk.
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time with us. The reason why Akiba was chosen as the head of the family ...... is to tell you the reason why I was entrusted to the Arima family.
<Page55>
"......It's simple.
　My brother had a reason why he just couldn't take over the Tono family.
　He really forgot even that.#......
It would have been nice if that mirage could have lasted forever."
"...... Akiba......?"
<Page56>
"......... My brother is not from the Tono family.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web, as well as to make sure you're getting the most out of it.
　---------- -- What?
<Page57>
"...... brother and I, and Shiki.
　We were raised as true siblings.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. I'm sure you'll agree with me. ...... But when Shiki became such a mess, everything went haywire.
<Page58>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　The Tono family is a family of social standing, isn't it?
　So you can't ...... rashly inform people that the eldest son, the heir, is gone.
<Page59>
"And then my father had an idea.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're going to be doing and how you're going to do it.
　...... At that point, the brother and Shiki were switched.
　The Shiki who was killed survived and the Shiki who killed him died. That is the relationship between your brother and Shiki."
<Page60>
"'...... Then what? I'm not Akiba's brother, and I'm not from Tono,----."
　Of course, I'm not from the Arima family.
"I'm... who the hell are you?
<Page61>
"...... I'm sorry ...... no one can answer that question anymore. My brother, the child who was named Shiki, is nowhere to be found.
　The child named Shiki died seven years ago. It is not death as life, but death as existence. His family register, his past, his home, and his memories are nowhere left.
　Because seven years ago, when my brother took the place of Tono Shiki, all ...... my father, he got rid of it."
<Page62>
　---------- -I'm sorry.#I'm sure you'll agree.
"That's why ...... my brother was sent to Arima's house.
　For the sake of public opinion, the eldest son of the Tono family must remain alive. But the truth is, they are not related by blood, so they cannot be made heirs."
<Page63>
"Your father banished your brother to the house of Arima, giving the reason that he was weak from the accident. ...... He told me, who remained behind, not to allow him to enter the house of Tono again."
<Page64>
　......... Akiba's voice is somewhat shaky.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's probably a guilt trip for me.
<Page65>
　But that's the wrong way to go. I don't have the slightest intention of blaming you.
　In fact, just because Akiha thinks so, it really is a relief.
　Still...#There are things you need to ask now.
<Page66>
"...... No. There are still two questions that need to be answered. Keep talking to me, Akiba. Things haven't been resolved properly, then.
<Page67>
"The first one. It's not that I'm not a fan of the idea, but it's not that I'm not a fan of the idea. ...... Well, this is just a minor question or confirmation.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
　...... I actually have a bit of a strange constitution, but is this just a coincidence?"
<Page68>
"'...... I don't know. You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page69>
"So ...... well, I really don't care about who I am at this point. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　I'm not sure what to say. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　If it wasn't for that wound, you'd be dead, right?　Then you're lucky to be here."
　Yeah. That's not the point. The question is: ----
<Page70>
"The second question. Why is Shiki still alive?"
"...... Brother ......, that's .........
<Page71>
"It's funny, he's still alive.
　Shiki was defeated by Tono's blood and did something called a reversal, right?
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　Then there's no way he's alive like that."
"..............."
<Page72>
"There's only one possibility. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　...... No, maybe my dad didn't take his breath away.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't lose your mind. I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one who's had it.　Just like I was carried to the hospital."
<Page73>
　It's a great way to get to know each other.
　You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page74>
"I'm not sure what to say. In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to use it for a lot of things.
"That's no way ...... to ---- do it."
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page75>
"It's all right. It is not the Akiha's fault, nor is it the father's fault. It's not your fault, of course, but it's not Shiki's fault either.
　The ...... cause is, really, just a coincidence.
　It's just bad luck that a crazy guy from another country ended up in the shiki. If there is something really bad, it is only the thing that made the shiki go crazy.
<Page76>
　Akiha remains downcast and does not say anything.
　This is the end of the ...... story.
　I'm not sure what to say, but I'm going to say it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page77>
"I'm sorry, I'm a little tired. I'm going to sleep, so why don't you go outside?"
"............ Yes. If you say so, brother."
　Akiha left for the door.
<Page78>
"---- Akiba.#Akiha.
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time with your family.
"What is it, brother?
<Page79>
"I'm sure you'll understand. Why did you ...... invite me to this mansion, Akiha?　I'm not ...... really your brother."
<Page80>
"...... Please don't say such a stupid thing.
　You are the only brother that I have. Now and then, my brother would have forgotten about it, but ever since we were children.
　---It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure if you've heard of it, but I'm sure you've heard of it.

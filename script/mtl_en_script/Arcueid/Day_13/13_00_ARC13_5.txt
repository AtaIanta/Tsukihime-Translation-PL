　In the moonlit corridor, we faced each other.
　Roa made no move.
　It was a disgusting sign of leeway that I had watched silently until now.
<Page2>
"But. I didn't expect you to be alive."
　As if nothing had happened, Roa speaks to me.
　---You can find a lot more information on the web.
<Page3>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. It is not a matter of strong or weak life force.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page4>
　The ...... filthiness of life is mutual.
　I'm sure you'll agree with me.
<Page5>
"The one who has come back from death can understand death.
　You and I, we're both cases of a very special ability.
　I've experienced death sixteen times before reaching this extreme point... and you've only experienced it once.
　Honestly, it's probably a difference in talent. It would be interesting to see how much of a different talent you would have if you had been reincarnated in that body."
<Page6>
　The rhyme that you get, the grating voice.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page7>
"...... I have two questions for you.
　I'll tell you one thing."
　My headache-filled thoughts force me to have one last conversation.
<Page8>
"---Hey. Okay, go ahead and say it."
　A sideshow from absolute dominance.
　It's a great way to make sure you get the most out of your time.
　Thank you.
The more he tries to be intelligent, the angrier I get at him.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't get stuck there anymore.
<Page9>
"The first question is the most important: ......
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page10>
"I'm not sure why.#I'm not sure what to do. It's only natural to kill him back, isn't it?
　I'm not sure if you'll be able to find the right one for you. This time, I was able to dismantle her to the best of my ability. It's ......, but the opportunity was lost.
<Page11>
"It's not worth it to get one with a true ancestor who is no different from a single vampire.
　Therefore, I judged it to be worthless and took care of it. It's a shame for me that it ended up like this."
<Page12>
　The enemy laughed, twisting his mouth.
　---His head hurts.#I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm sure you'll agree. I'm not sure what to do.
　I can't stand the fact that this guy is going to be around for even a second longer.
<Page13>
"Well. So, what are you going to do after this?
　It's not like you're going to use your body to fight me.
　I'm sure you're not the only one.
<Page14>
　It's a ...... well-known fact.
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time with your family.
　In the event that you've got the ability to do this, then you'll be able to do it.
<Page15>
"I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to make of it.
"...... wrong?"
<Page16>
"Yes. You can not be my enemy.
　I'm not talking about the difference in performance. It's not a metaphor for what's possible or impossible to kill.
　You lack the truth to make me your enemy in one respect."
<Page17>
　---#Those words were the only ones worth recording.
　The words of this man have never been, and will never be, worth remembering. But the words he just said contained the truth of the man.
<Page18>
"I'm a big believer in your abilities.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page19>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a good idea. It's a good idea. It's not actually melting. It's my vision that's melting.
　Anger at him. Hatred. Anger at me. Hatred.
　The emotion mixes, boils, and the lid which was closed is raised and lowered.
<Page20>
　---Ah. Beyond the brain, the scream of summer is beckoning.
　From the hole called "I". Gobori.#and.#By definition.#something that should not be#is.
<Page21>
"I'm sure you'll be happy with this power, Shiki.
　You can be happy, we are the only ones who can possess the demon eye of direct death. It would be a shame to lose that rare ability, but above all, we are the same. You can understand each other better than anyone else.
　There is no better partner than that."
"You're asking me to join ......?
<Page22>
"No. I'm asking you to become one of us, I'm telling you. I don't know your intentions. Such impurities will be erased here.
　Don't worry. After I've sucked out your blood and plundered your soul. I will make you into a being who can use death without hesitation."
<Page23>
　The distance doesn't matter anymore.
　It's just a matter of being in front of me.
　It's all right as long as you're alive.
<Page24>
"There's one more thing. The only things you can see are living things.
"Of course, if it's not a living thing, it has no life.
　The source of life, the "part", can only be found in living things.
<Page25>
"---- I knew it. It's a good point, vampire.
<Page26>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　But it's not enough. It's not enough.
　I go beyond it. There is no hesitation whatsoever. The woman who condemned it no longer exists in the world.
<Page27>
"...... doesn't add up. It's not appropriate for the last word.
　It's ...... okay. Let's end the chatter. There is also a church woman hiding somewhere to be dealt with.
　---I'm not sure what to say. The first thing you should do after making a servant of me is to rely on that woman.
<Page28>
"------"
　Ah, the best provocation. I'll take it as you wish.
<Page29>
　There are no ethics/common sense left.
　I can't remember the vision/formula.
　The flesh that makes up me has rotted away.
　The me that asserts the individual has been left behind.
　I don't...
<Page30>
　I don't know what it means to be human anymore.
<Page31>
"What?"
　His foot stops. His face freezes.
　"The body that has lost the basis for life is stiffening like a fetus.
<Page32>
"Wait... what is this?"
　There's no change in the world. There is nothing negative about him.
　He can't see anything that threatens him within his perception.
<Page33>
"Why... are my legs trembling?"
　That's why his eyes reflect only fear.
<Page34>
"There's a difference between what you and I see, vampire.
　---It's like...#It's like a flame.
"You see only life. You don't understand death.
　That's why you can't kill me. You can only kill weak women."
　---The cerebral spinal cord is white-hot.
<Page35>
"If you can see death.#If you could see death, you'd be insane. All you can see is the part that keeps things alive.
　If you can see death, you can't stand still.
　It's a metaphor for the moon world.
　It's like a wilderness where everything is dead.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. ...... To be able to see the death of things is to be thrown into a world where everything is vague and fragile.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page36>
"What--what are you talking about, you?"
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm sure you're right. ......
　You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　This means that he and I have very similar eyes, but very different ones.
<Page37>
"Stop. Don't look at me with those eyes, don't look at me with those eyes."
　Roar's voice is laced with fear.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page38>
"It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　---This is what it means to see death.
　These eyes are not something you can talk about with pride.
<Page39>
　Yes, those days when I was afraid to even walk.
　If I hadn't met that man, I would have gone crazy a long time ago.
<Page40>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　Life and death are just two sides of the same coin, and they will never, ever, ever meet face to face.
"So... don't look at me with those eyes...!"
<Page41>
　The sound of footsteps approaching. You can't demonstrate that lightning speed.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
"I'll tell you what.#This is what it means to kill a thing.
　This stab is much more concise.
<Page42>
　The moment. This is a great way to get the most out of your day.
<Page43>
"-----!"
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　A lot of the time, it's just a matter of time.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time and money.
　He was caught up in the collapse of the corridor and fell to the ground, crushed by the rubble.

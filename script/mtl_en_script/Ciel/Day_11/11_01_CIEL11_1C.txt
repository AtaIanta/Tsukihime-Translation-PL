　In spite of expectations, all the classes ended without any good taste.
"It's no wonder school is so boring."
　My friend was right when he said that during lunch break.
<Page2>
　On my way to the main gate, I turned to the schoolyard on a whim.
　There was no one on the field.
　Club activities were banned and it was past dismissal time, so there were no students left in the school.
<Page3>
　The sun is setting on the horizon in the distance.
　I'm the only one who likes to stay at school like this, with nothing better to do.
<Page4>
　The school building is turning Akaneiro.
　I don't like to see the sunset.
　It looks like blood sticking to the floor and reminds me of the events of the past few days.
<Page5>
　Something red. A red cityscape. A red processing plant.
　The carpet made of human flesh that was laid out in the stone chapel.
　That feeling like stepping on fresh snow becomes peculiar.
<Page6>
"I was ---- there."
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page7>
　　　　　　　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to do.　　　　I'm not sure.
　　　Why?
　　　　　　　　　　　My head.
　Why?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Stupidly.
　　　　　　　　Why?
<Page8>
"Oh, ----, oh, ----... -----"
　The pain subsided shortly after.
　Thank goodness it was an unpopular time.
　If someone, anyone, had been near me, that would have been enough to put my mind at ease, but no one was near me, thank God.
<Page9>
"I'm going home. I have no business here yet."
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page10>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　I can't seem to get rid of the sluggishness in my limbs.
　I need a fundamental solution.
　This is not a problem if you don't find a solution soon, even tonight.
<Page11>
"I'm back,......, is that Jade?"
　In the lobby, the jade was working on something.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page12>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's ...... too defenseless to sigh. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page13>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　I'm sorry I didn't notice your ...... return."
　...... worse and worse. It's a good idea not to show off your morbidly white nape of the neck like that.
<Page14>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. What's more, redecorating?
"Yes. The chairs in the playroom have been replaced with new ones, and Akiba-sama has asked that the old ones be moved to a room with fewer chairs.
<Page15>
"I see. Is Amber here?
"She's just outside. If you need me, I can come to your room later with you. ......
<Page16>
"No, that's okay. You can do it yourself.
　I'm thirsty, can I use the tea set in the dining room?
"Oh, ...... yes.
　I'm sure whatever's on the tray will be fine.
<Page17>
"I see. I'm sorry for stopping you while you were working.
　I'll see you later," he said, and headed for the cafeteria.
<Page18>
　I quenched my thirst and returned to the lobby.
　There was a set of green tea and some light refreshments on the tray, which made for an unexpectedly long tea break.
　Well.
　It seems that my housemates haven't come home yet, so I'm going to stay in my room until dinner.
<Page19>
"Ouch."
　It's a good idea to have a chair in the back of the house that you can sit on.
<Page20>
　The chair was placed near the wall so as not to get in the way.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't bump into anyone if you're looking ahead properly.
"I'm not sure how I feel about this. I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page21>
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　You can find a lot more chairs in the lobby. It's a good idea to take a look at the website of the company. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us. You have no sense at all. No modesty. There is no use for it.
<Page22>
　Fuck ....... The knee I hit on the chair is still hurting.
　This is extra pain.
　It's an emotion I wouldn't have used if it weren't for the chair.
　I'm stingy.
　The free time I had was ruined by the mismanagement of a single servant.
<Page23>
　I kicked the chair quite naturally.
　It's a good idea.
　And the reaction to the kicking made my feet hurt even more.
　Zukin.#Zukin.#　Zukin.#Zukin.#I'm sorry.
"------- this guy."
　What a distraction, that guy.
<Page24>
　It's nerve-wracking.
　What an eyesore, this chair.
　This chair.#This chair.#This chair.#This chair.#This chair.#This chair.#This chair.#This chair.#This chair.#This chair.#This chair.#This chair!
<Page25>
"Shiki-sama ......!"
"Hey, Jade.
　What's wrong with you? You're suddenly in a place like that.
<Page26>
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to do. You will find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　It's as if you've been running a marathon for dozens of miles.
<Page27>
"I'm not sure why I'm ...... breathing so hard.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page28>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page29>
"I'm not sure.　This is a great way to get the most out of your business. I'm sure you'll be pleased to hear that.
"...... Shiki, do you not know what you were doing ......?
"I don't know what I'm doing, I'm not...
<Page30>
"Damn...
　I'm not sure what to do. This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your money.
　There is no original form.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page31>
"------ What?"
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page32>
"This ...... me?"
"I'm not sure what to say. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your investment.
"This ----...
<Page33>
　I thought my heart was going to stop in surprise.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I look down at my hands in dismay. There is certainly a mark there where I continued to grip the chair leg.
<Page34>
"Why, so?"
　I don't know what it means.
　I'm not sure if I can grasp the action.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money. This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time and money.
<Page35>
"I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you. ...... Shiki-sama, are you feeling unwell?
　If you are not feeling well, I can call a doctor for you.
"------"
　I know those eyes.
　You will find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page36>
"It's not. It's nothing. It's nothing.
　I'm sorry Jade, I'm sorry ...... I'm out of my mind.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website to see if there is anything you can do to help.
<Page37>
"It's a good idea to keep your eyes on the prize.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
"'It's all right, just leave me alone!
　I want to be alone. Let me be alone. ......!
<Page38>
　I run up the stairs yelling.
　It's as if you're running away, and you're thinking of someone else.

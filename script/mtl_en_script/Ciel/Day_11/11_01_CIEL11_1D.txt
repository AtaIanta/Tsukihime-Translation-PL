　I go back to my room and roll into bed.
　I put on a futon to isolate myself from the outside world.
　Again.
　Again, my temples tingle.
　A throbbing. The headache repeats without a break, as if a new heart has formed in the brain.

"............."
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea.
　It is because of this pain that I became violent for no reason.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
　Anyway... I need to calm down now.
　It's a good idea to take a look at your own personal life.

"I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one with a headache. It will soon settle down.
　It just hurts, it's the same old headache. ......"
　What else is there to say?
　Quiet. Just be quiet and it will go away.
　.......
　.............
　......................
　.............................. ...see, it's subsiding.
<Page4>
　The room is very quiet.
　If this is the room where only the sound of the clock is heard, the feeling will soon be quieted.
<Page5>
　Tsk. I'm not sure what to do. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.
　Hands on the ............ clock.
　Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.
　............ hey, be quiet.
<Page6>
　Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.
　............ Hey.
　Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.
　............ I told you to be quiet, but .........!
<Page7>
　---It stopped.
<Page8>
"All right. It's quiet now.
　This way, no one will disturb you anymore.
　If the headache doesn't go away, you can go to sleep.
　If you close your eyes, the dark night will come.
　At night, you can forget about everything.
　That's fine for now. After all, everything is over now.
<Page9>
"Oh, I see. Speaking of which...
　There are no vampires.
　There is no opponent to be afraid of.
　There is no nightmare chasing you.
　There are no more annoying agents.
　---I'm sure you'll agree.
　I exhaled deeply, and decided to fall into a deep sleep.

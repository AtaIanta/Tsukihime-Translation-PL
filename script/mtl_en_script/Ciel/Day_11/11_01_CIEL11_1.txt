　A hot summer day.
　A blue sky and a big, big cloud.
　The shimmering landscape.
　And the faint sound of cicadas.
　The voice of the cicadas.
<Page2>
　mmm mmm mmm
　mmm mmm mmm mmm
　I want to die.
　---- It's so loud, it makes me want to die.
<Page3>
　The cicada's husk in the square.
　The sun seems to be right beside you.
　The square becomes scorched gradually.
　The hot day of midsummer.
　It's as if the world has gone blank.
<Page4>
　Enn, enn, enn
　Enn enn enn
　Enn enn enn
　Akiha is crying.
　In front of Akiha, a child is lying down.
　His white shirt is stained bright red, and he doesn't move a muscle.
<Page5>
　I look down at it.
　My hands are as red as a fallen child's.
　No, no.
　These hands are only red from the blood of the fallen child.
<Page6>
　In other words, I am.
　I've been a bastard and a murderer since I was a kid.
<Page7>
　In the sunless garden.
　Large flowers bloom in the moonlight.
　In the sky, a white face blocking the air.
　In the middle of the circling stars, there is one innocent and pure white woman.
<Page8>
　She does not even know words.
　She does not understand the meaning of self.
　It is treated only as a means of slaughter.
　There is no wound though it is covered with fresh blood.
　The vermilion that wets the dress is only the heart blood of the brethren.
<Page9>
　The freedom allowed to the woman is only that.
　The woman who finished her business and returned is imprisoned in the depths of the castle like a falling star.
　They fall into a sleep that they cannot even wake themselves up from.
　The ...... white woman does not even know its fate and just looks up at the moon with distant eyes.
<Page10>
　---It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　Is it an illusion?
　Perhaps it is an illusion.
　But it doesn't matter. Whether it is an illusion or the truth, it is the same thing.
　The image burned into the retina does not disappear even if it dies.
　A mysterious flower. The only one on this earth, the element of a shining star.
<Page11>
　I thought of plucking that star.
　If they are immortal, death will not separate them.
　A ring bound by blood.
　It's a great way to make sure that you'll be able to get the most out of your vacation.
　It is natural to fall into ...... hell.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page12>
"Oh ----
　I wake up from a long ...... sleep.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page13>
　I wonder if the window has been left open.
　You can hear the birds chirping in the garden.
　A chilly breeze hits my cheeks.
　The pale sunlight on my eye lids.
　A soft morning is coming.
<Page14>
　I get up from my bed and check the time and day.
　It's Friday, just before 7 a.m.
　My body is not in good shape.
　I guess I'm not tired enough. I feel faint and feverish all over.
<Page15>
"Ugh. ............"
　I felt like throwing up just by taking a deep breath.
　This is not the usual anemia, but a discomfort from hunger.
　It's as if there's a poisonous substance in my abdomen that makes me sick.
<Page16>
"Excuse me."
　A servant comes into the room.
　The master of the room seems to have thought I was still asleep, but he seems faintly surprised to see me awake.
<Page17>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
"----"
　Why?
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page18>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to do.
　I'll be there in a minute, so get out. Get dressed, now."
"...... I'm sorry.
　I'll be waiting for you in the dining room.
<Page19>
"....... What the fuck am I doing?
　It's crazy to hit someone because you feel bad.
<Page20>
"...... But then again...
　I feel bad.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time in the classroom.
<Page21>
"...... That's right. I have to go to school. ......"
　I'm too nauseous to think straight, but
　It's a great way to get to know your fellow students.
　Take a slow, deep breath to distract yourself from the discomfort in your stomach.
　I left my room, suppressing my chronic ...... but inconvenient ...... vertigo.
<Page22>
　After finishing the tasteless meal, he appeared in the living room.
".................."
<Page23>

"I'm not sure what to say. You're early again this morning.
"Good morning, brother.
　It's a good morning for you too. It seems you were up late last night. - Yeah.
<Page25>
　Oh, so that's why you were feigning anger.
　It's a great way to intimidate people into following the rules of the house.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page26>
"I'm sorry I missed your curfew by an hour.
　I'm sorry I missed curfew by an hour, and I'm sorry I've been sick this morning. I've been resting in the park.
<Page27>
"I told you to call me when you were sick. I'll send someone to pick you up right away.
　...... So. How sick are you feeling?
<Page28>
"It's just a lack of appetite. It will get better in a while, so don't worry about it. Don't worry, you'll be fine in a while.
"...... Are you all right?　You don't look well, and if you don't feel well, you might want to take the rest of the day off.
<Page29>
"That's fine. I've got the day off tomorrow, so I'll get through today. Just take care of yourself. You work a lot harder than I do.
<Page30>
"No, no, no, I'm doing my duty. I'm the head of the family.
"I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier. If it's your day off, I can help too, just let me know if you need anything."
<Page31>
"And, brother, ......?　There is something wrong,......, no, did you eat something good?　I'm not sure. It's a good idea to have a good friend who can help you out.
<Page32>
"'......, what do you think your own brother is?
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what's going on in your life.
　See, we don't have time to relax, do we?　Isn't the time almost up?"

　...... Um, brother?
"What?"
<Page35>
"I'm happy to accept your proposal.
　I will be holding a welcome party for your brother on Sunday afternoon, so please leave it open."
<Page36>
　The sister left the living room with a dignified attitude.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.

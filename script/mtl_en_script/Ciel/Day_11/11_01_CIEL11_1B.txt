"I'm glad to hear that. But they haven't caught him, have they?

<Page10>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to do.
"It's not a problem for me, I'm just too sick to do anything about it!
　I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.
"What?　You mean like me?
<Page11>
"I'm not sure. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　When I thought back on it later, I wondered why I thought he looked like Tono-kun. ......

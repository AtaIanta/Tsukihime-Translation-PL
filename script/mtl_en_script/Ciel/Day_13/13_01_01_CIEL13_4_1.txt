　In ...... my head, the last firing pin fell.
　---I killed it.#　---I killed it.
　--- Killed.
　Without Tono Shiki, I killed the family that believed in me.
　All because I prioritized my own life.
　Then...
<Page2>
　---Everything.
　If it becomes an illusion, it's fine.
<Page3>
　Gripping the knife tightly, I stand up.
　The sound of footsteps become louder.
　A sure sign that the enemy is approaching.
　Each time, the voice of "someone" echoes in my head.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page4>
"----"
　I'm not sure what to do.
　Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
　Rose, rose, rose, rose, rose, rose.
　Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. ----
"Shut up.#Shut up."
　I kept my will strong and silenced my mind.
<Page5>
"'This is my decision to make.
　Ba----
"'I don't need you telling me what to do.
　La----
"If you don't want Ciel to kill you...
　----
"Shut up until it's over.

<Page6>
　The voice disappeared completely.
　You can find a lot more information on the web.
　---I'm not sure what to make of it.

"You finally decided to fight.
　For some reason, she said in a voice that sounded relieved.
<Page8>
"I'm glad. Now we are both innocent.#　If it's on the condition that we kill each other, our sins will be offset. All that remains is the punishment for those who survive."
<Page9>
"[..................]
　Kill the sin with your own death.
　It's a world I don't understand.
<Page10>
"But can you atone for the punishment of those who remain?
"Yes. A compensatory act that can be fulfilled is called a punishment.
　The only thing that does not disappear is the sin.
　So...
You don't want to have to bear that now, do you?
<Page11>
　One step, she steps in.
<Page12>
"So, killing your senior here is not a sin?
"I'm sure you'll agree. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　I'm not sure what to do. The conditions are the same.
<Page13>
　One more step.
"--------"
　...... is not good.
　It's not good at all, not good at all.
<Page14>
#Sure, I'm about to get killed.
　And I'm trying to kill her back to save my life.
　But she's not.
　She came to me with the intent to kill.
　It's...
<Page15>
"Goodbye.
　Let's put an end to this stupid play."
　The last step.
　The tip of the bayonet is pointed at my heart.
　Before that.
　I just leaned forward carelessly and aimed at the "point" of her right lung.
<Page16>
　---I didn't think I could kill her.
　It was only logical that her bayonet would pierce my heart before I stepped into knife range.
<Page17>
　So I was surprised.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page18>
"---- ahead, sir."
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page19>
"This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　A weak voice before death.
"That was my greatest sin.#"That was my greatest sin.
　With a weepy voice, she used her last ounce of strength to plunge the bayonet into my chest.
<Page20>
"------..."
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
<Page21>
　In front of me.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your vacation.
"'----
What?
　You know what I mean.
"---- stupid."
　Did you know from the start that you were the only one to blame?
<Page22>
"Ha. ----

"............#I'm sorry.
　Nothing comes to mind.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　---That's ridiculous.
　There's no meaning to it.
<Page25>
"But still...
　I was sad that he died without apologizing to me.

"What the hell, after all..."
　Was I in love with this person?
　Until the end.

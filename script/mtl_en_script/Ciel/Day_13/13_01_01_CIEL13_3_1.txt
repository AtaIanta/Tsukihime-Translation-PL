　Immediately after. I crashed backwards into a small pile of rubble many meters away from her.
<Page7>
"-------"
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page8>
"Ouch ......!"
　The left arm is painful.
"What ...... is ......?
<Page9>
　I can't catch up with my understanding.
　The left elbow is bent into an angle.
　In addition to that, as if shaved with a huge rasp, the flesh is shaved off to the shoulder mouth slenderly.
<Page10>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　If you hadn't done anything, I would have made you comfortable now.
"Protect your neck and ----?"
<Page11>
　I can't ...... feel it.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page12>
　The result is this.
　The forearm is shattered and the arm itself is cut in half.
<Page13>

<Page15>
"Gosh ......!"
　Pain. Now the damage to the arm is properly signaled.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　This is the only way to get a white blank in your consciousness.
<Page16>
"-----"
　The senior is looking at me with cold eyes.
"This---'s."
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　You know how much this hurts?
　Make fun of me.
　Make fun of me.
　Make fun of me. -----!
<Page17>
"If you're so inclined.
　I grab the knife in my pocket.
"I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a hard touch.
"I'm not going to be killed.
　I'm not going to be killed.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page18>
"You're an idiot, you know that?
　The moment.
　The senior's body exploded.
<Page19>
　---No, no, no.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　That is exactly what it is, like a lizard crawling on the ground.
<Page20>
　In the blink of an eye, you can complete a distance of six meters.
　I know she's already in front of me, but I still can't see her body.
<Page21>
　I reflexively let my head fall back. As I let go, I lower my gaze to my feet.
　Before that less than a breath movement is over.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page22>
"Ha,...............!"
　I'm not sure what to say.
　Is there pain, is there pain?　Yes, I can still feel the pain.
　Are you conscious? Are you conscious?　Okay, still kind of there.
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, ............!"
　The body, the body... how is it, how is it?
<Page23>
　The blood is black and gushing out.
　It's spewing out of the wind tunnel in my left shoulder.
　It's just now.
　This is the result of the senior's muzzle deflecting off my throat and piercing my left shoulder.
<Page24>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　It's not a problem.
　It's not just a matter of it hurting, it hurts.
"I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
　But I'm alive.
　I'm alive somehow.
<Page25>
　The body. I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
"Ah, ah, ah."
　The moment that muzzle pierced, the trigger was pulled?
　So I'm blown away and I'm out of distance from my senior again.
<Page26>
"It's not a coincidence that ...... it goes on twice, isn't it?
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page27>
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　The stake that shot me became the pages of a book and scattered.
<Page28>
"It's made of paper...... paper, bullets, and so on."
　That's a lot of bullshit.
　But now that bullshit is terrifying. It's so horrible that just looking at it makes me want to put my head on the ground and cry and apologize.
<Page29>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　My shoulders are on fire.
　The whole body seems to be burned as it is, burning pain.
　It's like an incinerator that doesn't even leave white bones.
<Page30>
　It's a good idea to have a good time.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
　That's why you die.
　Even if you are immortal, you will die.
　Definitely, no matter what, you will be killed.
<Page31>
　Fear and pain, confusion and tension flash impatiently.
　Are you afraid of dying? Are you afraid of being killed? Am I afraid of receiving such intense pain that I die? Am I afraid of being killed with a weapon that makes me want to cry and beg for forgiveness?
　I don't know. Now I don't know because I can't take my eyes off that weapon and that ruthless agent.
<Page32>
　Gashan, a light sliding sound was heard.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　......2 times.
　It's nothing short of a miracle that I managed to do that thing twice.
　The next one is definitely ----
<Page33>
　I imagined a picture of that muzzle shooting through the center of my face and an iron nail going through the bridge of my nose and into the back of my head.
　That is more horrifying than horrifying.
　Death. No matter what form it takes, it is foul, dirty, and horrible.
　I don't want to go through that because I value my life.
<Page34>
　Is that why you're afraid?
　I don't know. I despise what I don't know.
<Page35>
　I've seen so much death, and yet I've never thought about the toxicity of so much death.
　I saw only the result and did not consider the death that was in the process.
<Page36>
　More than dying.
　I was so focused on the future of being dismantled by surprise that I forgot to consider life, which is more horrible than death.
<Page37>
"Oh, gosh, ......!"
　The pain in your shoulder will pull you back to consciousness.
　It's not important now.
<Page38>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　If you don't want to die, all you have to do now is think about running away...
<Page39>
"You're not taking off your glasses?
"What?"

　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　If that happens, I might end up killing my senior, just in case...
<Page41>
"I'm not sure what you're talking about,......!
"-------"
　That is.
　It's a very good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page42>
"You can't keep up with the .......

"No, no...
"Why don't you at least struggle? If you kill me, you can live for a day. It suits you to die in vain, looking at such an impossible hope.
<Page58>
"Don't...
"You don't have to dress up now.

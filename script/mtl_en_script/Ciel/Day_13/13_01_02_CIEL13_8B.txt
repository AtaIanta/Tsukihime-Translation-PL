　The ...... clock is about to turn 5 o'clock.
　The time has flown by.
　We are in bed, not sleeping, looking up at the ceiling.
<Page2>
"'You must never sleep at night. On the other hand, you can sleep during the day. Roa is a bloodsucker, so she will calm down in the morning."
<Page3>
　Thank God for that. I have not slept for two whole days, so I was at my wits end.
<Page4>
　I'm sure you've heard of it.
　What if I had to go to church?
<Page5>
"...... In the first place, no matter how many procedures you go through to get permission, if you're a vampire, won't you be turned away at the door?"
<Page6>
"'That's alright. Tono-kun hasn't sucked blood or killed anyone, right?　I'm sure you'll be able to get in through the back door because you're innocent even if you're on the verge of becoming a vampire."
<Page7>
"............"
　I'm not so sure about that. I have no memory of the last few days.
　I'm sure you're not the only one.
<Page8>
"So, you don't remember anything, do you?　Then I am innocent. I'm not talking about the mental side, but the real side."
<Page9>
"...... How can you be sure you didn't do anything if you have no memory of yourself?"
<Page10>
"Yes. If you have no memory of actually committing an act, you have not committed a crime.
　Listen, Tono-kun. The reincarnated body's consciousness and Roa's consciousness are the same. Even if there are times when Roa's consciousness overrides his own and he acts, he will always remember what he did.
　The fact that you have no memory of the murder is the most certain proof of your innocence.
<Page11>
　Ah, I feel a sense of relief and a renewed sense of my senior's strength.
"Roa's actions will always be remembered."
　...... Because that means that she's facing her sins without leaving any behind.
<Page12>
　The ...... outside of the window is now white.
　It's almost time.
　I've been listening to my senpai's voice all day.
<Page13>
　If you talk to her, you will probably hold her back.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page14>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm going to try.
　He looked up at her profile as she lay on the bed.
<Page15>
"It's ...... time.
　If I could put Tono-kun away in my pocket, we could be together."
<Page16>
　It's not always possible for me and my senior to be together.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page17>
　In the event that you are not able to find a way to separate the two, even in the church, you can only settle the matter by yourself.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page18>
"I won't let you die.
"What ......?
<Page19>
"I'll never let you die. I won't give Tono-kun to Roa. I'll protect you. I will definitely, I will definitely save you.
　So... please don't say that.
<Page20>
"...... I didn't say that. You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　But ......."
　I stopped to put my feelings into words, "Thank you.
　This is really a temporary distraction.
<Page21>
"I'm off. I'll be back as soon as I can, so please don't leave this room until then.
<Page22>
　By the way, they have enough food for a week.
　The majority of it is retort curry, but let's leave that aside for now.
<Page23>
"It's also worth mentioning, please don't have an affair while I'm away.
　I'm very jealous.
<Page24>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.

　The steps made up of rubble are like a giant's staircase.
　If you just want to go down, even a child can do it, but if you want to go back up to the ground, it is impossible to go one way.
<Page4>
　It is difficult to climb up just one step of nearly two meters, but it continues in succession, and depending on the amount of force, there is a risk that the step itself will collapse.
　Once again, I was reminded of the inconvenience of being human and the low motor skills of animals.

"My goal is to destroy the Roar.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. I was just checking on the reincarnation to make sure it was real.

<Page44>
"You already know, don't you?
　You know who I've been targeting, who I've been hating, who I've been hunting down.
　To kill Roa, you can't simply kill a reincarnated body. You must first have him fully awakened. Because if you kill him when he's only half awake, you can only kill half of him."

<Page48>
"She's lying. You've always been so protective of me."
"Did it seem that way to you?　I was merely observing, you know.
　...... Well, there have been mistakes.
　In terms of personality, you don't seem to be Roa, isn't the reincarnated body of Tono Akiha? You will find a lot of things that you can do.

　You can get a lot more information on the web.

"You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life. It is also during this time that the adopted child who was taken in by the Tono family disappeared.
　When I came across this record, I was relieved.
　Tono Shiki isn't Roa---no, he's not.
　To be precise, even if Tono Shiki is not Roa right now, it's a good point."

　I'm not going to change my mind about you being Loa.
<Page55>
"You know what? I don't know what happened in the Tono family seven years ago, but you were murdered by the eldest son of the Tono family.
　No, I think they took your life. As a result, you were connected to the human who was the reincarnation of the loa.

"I'm not sure what to make of that.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web and also to make sure that you are getting the most out of it.

<Page70>
"It's shameful. I'm not sure what you're talking about.
　Yes, if you don't believe me, why don't I tell you?
　It's all a myth. The only reason I helped you and stayed at the school was to flush out Roa."
<Page71>
"There's no way I'm leaving Tono-kun behind, is there?"
　The senior said so with a smile.
　The thing is, it's not for me.
　In the event that you're not sure what to do, you can always ask for help.

　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page78>
"What are you... what are you talking about?
<Page79>
"It's just a little old story.
　Thirteen years ago, there was a child who, like you, knew nothing.
　She was 12 years old when she was tainted by her urges.
<Page80>
"...... nothing until then. She didn't have any special powers like you, so she really didn't know anything and lived a normal life.
<Page81>
"He helped his father and went to school.
　I was not good at waking up early, so I always helped my father by working in the shop in the evening, but I still thought that I would inherit his shop in the future.

　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page83>
"But the girl's dream did not come true. The happiness that was so natural to her was destroyed by her own hands.
　The girl was a reincarnation of Roa.
<Page84>
"You will find a lot of people who are interested in this type of product.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life. In the end, he sucked the blood of his mother and father and killed the people of the city while laughing.
　That girl, she might have lost her mind then."
<Page85>
"You see, don't you, Tono-kun?
　There's no way to stop that. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's strange, isn't it? ---You are aware of your own consciousness.
<Page86>
　That is.
　That's not what I was talking about.
<Page87>
"But the nightmare ended rather quickly.
　Because a white vampire came and pierced Roa's heart.
<Page88>
　---Yeah, I know.
　So the girl died and Roa was reincarnated as a guy named Tono Shiki.
　But that's it.
<Page89>
"But that girl could not die.
　I'm sure you'll agree.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page90>
"This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
　It's also a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page91>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. It's strange, isn't it, that a shell abandoned by a soul called Roa should come back to life?
<Page92>
"After that, I was in trouble.
　The people of the church killed the heretic again and again, but no matter how they tried, he wouldn't die.
　He spent six months of his life being killed every day.
<Page93>
"[..................]
　You can't die, body.
　A body that can be restored no matter what.
　I'm not sure who that is.
<Page94>
　It looked ...... painful.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're going to be doing.
<Page95>
　And that, six months?
　You're saying that for six months, without a single day of rest, he spent his life just being killed and brought back to life ......?
<Page96>
"It's a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
　All the problems that can't be dealt with or solved are sent to a place called a burial agency.
　That's where the child was taught what had happened to him.
<Page97>
"...... Well, in short, the child is a contradiction.
　She is a human being born as a loa. Even though her personality was that of a girl until the age of 12, her soul name is Roa.
　That child is that child, but she is also Loa.
　So it would be a contradiction if that child, who is Roa, is dead while Roa is alive."
<Page98>
"'If there is the slightest break in this world, the world will repair that break for the world itself.
　Therefore - that child will continue to be forever as long as the reincarnating soul called Roa does not disappear. No one else, this order will 'fix' it on its own."
<Page99>
"The priest said, 'You are out of the loop.
　The director said, 'It's an authentication error. You'll never be allowed to log in or log out of human society for the rest of your life unless you delete Roa's address.
<Page100>
"As long as Roa is alive, the child will remain stationary forever.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're going to be doing and how you're going to do it.
<Page101>
"I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think it's a good idea. It's also a great way to get rid of a lot of the stress and anxiety that can come with being in the hospital.
<Page102>
"And so the husk discarded his former name and chose to live to exterminate vampires.
　---I can perceive where the soul of Loa is more than Alcade, the master of Loa.
　Do I really need to tell you why?"
<Page103>
"-------"
　Yes, I do need to say it.
　I just don't want to admit it.
<Page104>
"You said it before, Tono-kun.
　What do I want to kill Roa for?
　What do you want, to kill a vampire?"
<Page105>
"---Because I want to die as a human---"
　At the time, I didn't know what that meant.
　But now.
　I'm not sure if I can understand it now, but I think I can.
<Page106>
"I can't ----."
　Yeah, I'm so frustrated, I can't do it.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.

　I don't know yet.
　I don't know the pain of killing someone I care about with my own hands.

　The seventh holy book is a form of many causes of death, but its essence lies in the "soul crushing".
　The doctrine of the Holy Land Church has no concept of reincarnation.
　After death, a person can only fall into hell or be summoned to heaven depending on his deeds before his death. There is no such thing as being born on earth again.

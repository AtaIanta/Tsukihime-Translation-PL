　Time passed like burnt iron, dull, hot and heavy.
<Page2>
　I can't look at my bloody right hand properly.
　The broken finger is back, the bleeding has stopped, the wound is closed.
　It's so far from human that I can't believe it's mine.
<Page3>
　Haa, haa, haa.
　The room is filled with the sound of animal breathing.
　The morning had arrived without being able to sleep at all.
<Page4>
　My head hurts.
　I seem to have dropped my glasses somewhere.
　I can't find them.
　It's an important thing, but I can't find it.
　The more important it is, the harder it is to find.
　I can see "lines" all over the room, and I feel nauseous.
<Page5>
　Haa, haa, haa
　I feel so nauseous that I cut them all up.
　It makes me feel a little better.
　The suffering stops only at the moment of cutting things.
　On the other hand, the more you cut things, the more thirst you will have afterwards.
<Page6>
　Haa, haa, haa
　I already know what I'm thirsty for.
　Anyway, I was thirsty for everything.
　Everything I see is annoying.
<Page7>
　It's unsightly.
　I don't know what the point is of continuing to live with an endlessly increasing number of things that have a predetermined end and a visible limit.
　It is too mismanaged and too hapless. All the things that I can see look eerie.
<Page8>
　If you close your eyes, all you'll remember is the feeling you had when you killed someone.
　The hard, unbloodied blade.
　The feeling of the hard, bloodless blade becoming one with the soft, pulsating flesh.
　Mental damage that would be crippling to an intelligent higher animal. A horrible feeling that makes you want to bite your tongue out. A dead end that makes you despair that there is no more. Once you know what it is, there's no going back.
<Page9>
　In addition to this, it is also possible to make use of a lot more than just a few of them.
　The excitement of dismantling Alcade into seventeen pieces is burned into my brain and will not leave.
<Page10>
　That beautiful limb.
　Although it was a human vessel, the pleasure of cutting a strong life that far surpassed a human into zaps was over.
　That time. The one who was killed was not that woman, but it must have been my brain marrow.
<Page11>
　Haa, haa, haa.
　I wanted to destroy what was healthy.
　I want to kill what's healthy.
　I understand that it is forbidden, but I can't suppress it.
　I'm going to get excited all over my body and do something about it.
<Page12>
"I'm not sure what to do.
<Page13>
"I'm not sure what to say, but I'm sure you'll understand.
<Page14>
"------"
<Page15>
　The suddenness of the stranger's voice terrified me.
　You will find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to make a living.
<Page16>
"Good morning. I've brought you a change of clothes, can you unlock the door?
<Page17>
"Shiki-sama, I've brought you a change of clothes. Please unlock the door if you are awake.
<Page18>
"............. ....... ......?
<Page19>
　Open the door?
　Open the door and let ■■ inside?
　---I'm not kidding.
　If that happens, I can't guarantee what I'll do.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　And yet, such a
<Page20>
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page21>
"Shut up!　Leave me alone!"
　I shouted loudly at the door.
"...... Shiki?　Could it be that your headache is getting worse?
<Page22>
"...... Shiki-sama?　Are you feeling unwell?
<Page23>
"I told you to leave me alone. ......!
　Just let me be alone. ......!
　If you come into the room, you'll do something you can't get back.
<Page24>
"..............."
　After the silence, I heard the footsteps of ■■■.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
<Page25>
　Haa, haa, haa.
　It's safe now. If there is no one around, there is no need to ■■ anyone.
　I felt a little calmer when I thought that.
　Distraction. For a distraction, shall we read a book?
<Page26>
"...... what?"
　The book that was in the sunroom is not there.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation. This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
　You can find no matter how much you look for it.
<Page27>
　Hah, hah, hah.
　I can't find it.
　I desperately try to remember what kind of binding it was.
　I just can't remember.
<Page28>
"Book ...... Book ......"
　If you think about it.
　How could that book have been in my room?
　No title. No name. I don't even know where it was printed. Just a long, long human story that shouldn't exist in this world.
<Page29>
　I search the bookshelf. If it's not on the table, it must have been put back on the shelf.
　I can't find it. Then the shelf must be empty. It's only natural if he has one book on the shelf. There is no room on the bookshelf. The wall of spines rises perfectly.
<Page30>
　So I don't know. I don't remember having that book in my hands.
　I don't even know where that book was.
　In the first place --- was there really such a thing?
<Page31>
"......", right?　If I ever figure out that I am."
<Page32>
"...... Shut up, you ......
　...... reminds me of a grating woman's voice.
　That book. The content.
　It's the book that I always read when I couldn't sleep.
　I'm sure you'll be able to find something that will help you out.
<Page33>
"At ....... By ■ from myself. Shamelessly crying and screaming, apologizing for not wanting to ...... the neck."
<Page34>
　Yume---Yume.
　But I don't dream.
　In the first place, Tono Shiki does not have such knowledge.
　There is no material to dream like that.
　That's not my dream.
<Page35>
"...... simply because you don't realize it. ......"
"...... Shut up. Shut up. ......"
　Ha-ha-ha-ha.
　What is that thing then?
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but it's a good idea.
<Page36>
"The ...... truth is, I'm a crazed killer who's been dead for a long time. ......!"
　No. No, no, no. No. ......!
　It's just that my memory's a little foggy right now.
　Alcade is just special. At the time, I just couldn't control my desires, that's all.
<Page37>
　I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.
　I'm not going to go crazy over something like this now that Ciel has come back to me.
<Page38>
"I'm sure you're not the only one.
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why I'm here.
　And then one day, they just..."
"I'm telling you to shut up. ......
<Page39>
　Ha, ha, ha -----
　...... breathing hard.
　The sun's rays are irritating.
　My throat. I'm thirsty and I'm going crazy.
<Page40>
"'■■■■?　■■■■■■■■■, ■■■■?"
<Page41>
"Shiki-sama, ......!
　What are you doing, Shiki-sama?
<Page42>
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure if I'll be able to remember my own words.
<Page43>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to say.
<Page44>
　As the urge to rise.
<Page45>
　I want to make a creature, and I want to make it.
　The only thing that comes to mind is the image of yourself, making a noise in your throat.
<Page46>
"Ohhhh ----！！！！！！！"
　Head. Hit the head against the wall.
　Many times, many times, until the forehead is about to crack, hit.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
<Page47>
　This is a great way to get the most out of your day. ......
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　This is it.
　Is this the loa?
<Page48>
　There is a banging sound on the door.
　I can't open it.
　If I open it, it will be the end of me.
<Page49>
"Oh, -----."
　That dream is the memory of the loa before me.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page50>
"------"
　...... There is no way.
　It's not a problem that can be solved by me killing myself.
　This is the only thing I can do about it.
<Page51>
　It's because of that dream.
　Understand the feelings of the previous incarnation as an experience.
　The only one who will die when I die is my Ishi, and the remaining Roa Ishi will have complete control over this body.
　If that happens, I will be in a much worse situation.
<Page52>
"■■■■■. ■■■■■■■■■■■, ■■■■?"
<Page53>
"I'm not sure what to do.
<Page54>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page55>
　It's too far away.
　I'm not sure what to say. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your vacation.
　Now it is already heard far away, about between the moon and the earth.

　I make my way out of the valley of rubble and back to the center of the sunken earth.
　On my own, my body is so much lighter.
　Now, if I use the steps of the rubble as a foothold, I will be able to return to the ground in a few minutes.
　However...
<Page2>
"I'm sure you're not the only one.
　Did you just give up?　Or are you begging for your life?
　Either way, is this the end of the fun rabbit hunt?"
　There's no way that thing would miss such a development.
<Page3>
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　I'm not sure what to do. ---It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page4>
"'Yeah, yeah, you've dropped your bags in the dark.
　Yeah, that's good, that's the right thing to do. Good. You still have some humanity left in you, don't you, Shiki?
<Page5>
"............"
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to do. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

　The only one who could keep up with my movement was Noel. I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page7>
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　It's a circular enclosure with a diameter of nearly 40 meters.
<Page8>
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
　I'm not sure what to make of it. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time and money.
　If that happens, I'm just a target. It's easy to get skewered in the heart.
<Page9>
　This is probably the original purpose of that weapon.
　The basis of Noel is the "torment of house arrest".
<Page10>
　The fact that he was locked up in a prison with a certain size and shown a slow hell is the prototype of his different ability.
　The only way to get out of this circle is to eliminate her as the main source.
<Page11>
"I'm afraid. If you take off your glasses, it means you're ready to kill me, right?"
<Page12>
　---Now, the only thing left to do is to kill each other.
　The slightest error in judgment, the slightest difference in luck, and I will be killed.
　Are you afraid of ......?
　I'm afraid so. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page13>
　I've seen the inner workings of that girl as well as the power difference between us.
　I can't hate that vampire to the core, and that will lead to a clear defeat.
　But I can't afford to lose. I can't just fall down here.
<Page14>
　You will find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. It's a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page15>
"I know, I know. I'm sure you've heard of it.
　I'm not sure if I can do that, I'd lose. Well, in this case, is there life in the stew?　Well, it doesn't matter either way.
　In the event that you're not sure what you're looking for, there are a number of things you can do.
<Page16>
　...... is coming. In the event that you've got a lot of money to spend, you'll be able to take advantage of it.
<Page17>
　I gripped the knife in my forward hand, resting my center of gravity on both heels.
"I'm sure you'll agree that corporal punishment is appropriate. The teacher will test you to see how long you can hold out with such a knife. ......!
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.
<Page18>
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　You can see Noel's mouth stiffen.
<Page19>
　In front of me is a woman's stomach, exposed and unprotected.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page20>
"I'm sure you'll agree.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family.
<Page21>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　It failed. It's not just Noel who is vampirized. This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page22>
　As a result, this is the end result of just a snatch.
　Even with that small body, it has the horsepower of a small truck. You should think about it. It's not enough to just dodge the murder weapon.
<Page23>
"Wow, you look like a matador!　Or is that the art of the Utsukemi?
No, it's not. I'm the star of the show. At best, I'm an annoying damselfly.
　Either way, it's fun. You look great, Shiki!　If you are not able to hit the target, the next time you will be able to hit a little harder .......
<Page24>
　In the meantime, the enemy was in a similar situation.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page25>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page26>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　It's not just the elbow that does it, it's the bone in the right shoulder that shatters.
<Page27>
　The burning pain is not the pain of the wound, but the pain of healing the wound.
　You don't need to see it to know it. Now, on the inside of the shoulder, muscles like leeches are collecting the shattered bones, wrapping them, and forcibly "putting them back together.
<Page28>
"I've been wondering. I've been wondering about this for a while now.
　It can be a few seconds. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
<Page29>
"What?　I'm sure you'll agree.　Does a younger teacher excite you?
"...... Well, yes, I'm turned on in other ways.
<Page30>
　I'm not sure if you've heard of it or not.
　In the event that you're not sure what to do, you'll be able to ask your doctor.
<Page31>
　In her case, the optimal state of beauty is that appearance age.
　You can't help but feel sad as an animal when the optimal time is when you are immature.
<Page32>
"It's not that.
　I understand why you hate Roa. But is it okay to do it this way? If you kill me, Roa won't die."
<Page33>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page34>
"Yes, that's right. You're a smart beggar.
　You're right, messing you up won't hurt Roa in any way. My revenge will not be served."
"Then...
<Page35>
"Then... But it doesn't matter. Do you think that revenge on Loa means anything now?
　It's not like killing Roa is going to get you any praise from anyone. I'm sure you'll be able to find something that suits you.
<Page36>
"------"
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　I'm sure you've noticed the psychology of Noel by now.
　The right shoulder is ...... good, and the bone is already made.
<Page37>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　Yes, I just want to kill the reincarnation of Roa. I just want to kill you and feel good about it. I just want to kill that woman and feel good about it. ......!
<Page38>
"I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what to do with it.
　I'm not sure what to do.　It's only human to think about the future and hold back!
<Page39>
"''...... It's a contradiction. If you don't kill Roa, your senior can't die.
"Are you stupid?　That thing only comes back to life, it doesn't mean it can't die. If you kill him, he'll die.
<Page40>
"So, you know?　Just keep killing him. For example, how about immersing him in a pool of concentrated sulfuric acid?　If he comes back to life but dies instantly, he will be alive forever but not alive, right?
<Page41>
"------"
　It's more than enough time.
　My right shoulder is completely healed. The headache is because of the blood used.
<Page42>
　He also said he was completely calm.
　In addition to this, you will find a lot of other things that you can do to make your life easier.
　That's why I can push past my headache and ask one last question.
<Page43>
"Dr. Noel. I'm sure this is the last conversation you'll ever have with me.
"I'm not sure if it's the right word. Isn't that the correct Japanese?
"...... I'm not going to let you kill me. But if you're going to kill me, then it makes sense.
<Page44>
"Huh. So you want me to let Ciel go?　Are you serious?
　But I can't. I'm not sure what to do. I don't care about Shiki's life.　I don't know.
　Do you understand?　You're just an appetizer. I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page45>
"------ I see."
　With this, there was no more conversation.
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your vacation.
　The reason why you can not collapse here is also clear.
　I cut off my barely there sympathy and said.
"I was a fool for asking...!
　I bit down on the headache in my temples and tried to make contact for the second time.
<Page46>
　I'm not sure what to do. Two feet are enough to step in.
　I'm not sure what to do. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website and see if you can find any useful information. I'm sure you'll be able to tell.
<Page47>
　Two feet. You've entered the enemy's space.
　It is inferior here in the range of the weapon.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't get caught in the middle of the action.
<Page48>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page49>
　A pinprick.
　The smallest attack with the middle finger flicked me in the side and blew me to the iron fence.
<Page50>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your day.
　There is no feeling in the side of the stomach. The diaphragm is damaged and you can't breathe.
　In addition, this sound.
　The moment you touch the iron fence, you will be attacked by a sound that stirs your brain.
<Page51>
　When I open my eyes, the hands of the dead are already reaching out.
　Hands, hands, hands that rush to me as I fall to the ground.
　I fall and roll away from the iron fence.
　Perhaps it was Noel's instruction, but the dead did not enter the iron fence.
　If that's the case, Noel's own pursuit will come without a moment's delay---!
<Page52>
"I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
　The ...... chase did not come.
　In the center of the circle, there is one vampire hugging his own body.
<Page53>
"This is the vampire's body!　The body moves as you imagined and is filled with more power than you imagined. ......!
　I've always wondered why vampires do what they do.　I've been wondering why vampires are so pompous and why Germany and the rest of the world treat us like insects.　But now I know why!
<Page54>
"Because they're nothing but worms, humans!
　We're so small that we can only live once and die once.
<Page55>
".................."
　I walked away from the iron fence and towards the vampire.
　My breathing is still spotty, but I'm sure it will improve as I walk.
<Page56>
"'Yes, come.
　As long as you don't run away, the dead won't be able to touch you.
　Next time, I'll give you a proper slap in half, not just a finger. Let's have some fun in this ballroom until we're all torn to pieces, shall we?"
<Page57>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. ...... The fingers still don't work, but the arm can be moved.
　Also, after two attacks, I got the information I needed.
<Page58>
"............ Tsk."
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
　---It's not a good idea.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page59>
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　Even if the speed is increased a little, the upper limit of this vampire was already visible.
<Page60>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money. Ah, my left arm was blown off again. But well, it's a cheap deal. In front of me.
　In front of me, the head of a girl is presented, too defenseless.
<Page61>
　And I...
C:>It's troublesome. I'm not sure what to do.
C:>.................. No, that's not it.

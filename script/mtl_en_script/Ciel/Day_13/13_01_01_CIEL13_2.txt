　---There was no way to stop it.
　　　　It was no longer my own body.
　　　　As a result, I could not help but crave human blood.
<Page2>
"Ah...
　I put power into both legs trying to run up to her. I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page3>
"---- Ah!
　You'll be able to find a lot more information on the web. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page4>
I'm not sure what to say.
　You can find a lot more information on the web.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I thought it was the only way to go. I bit my tongue. If you stop breathing, your body will also stop.
It stops. Stop. Stop.
My right hand was blocked by it. The right hand that swung up to tear her was stuck in her mouth so that her tongue would not get stuck in her throat.
<Page5>
　But my left hand, my left hand alone, even if I put all my strength into it while crying, even if I put so much strength into it that my nose bled
　I couldn't even move my one left hand.
　My left hand, like a snake coiling around its prey.
<Page6>
"Oh...#Ahh...#Ohhhh ......!
　The left hand was tightening up her white neck.
<Page7>
　Huh.
"Ha--- ha, ha ...... ha, ha."
　I woke up to my own disordered breathing and laughter.
<Page8>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to help you.
　I don't know the logic behind it. I don't want to think about it right now.
　This will finally bring me into focus with reality.
　And so.
<Page9>
"Ha ----- is."
　In front of me, there is a ■■■ of amber.
<Page10>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure if he's lost consciousness or not. I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not even sure what that is anymore.
　It's just that there is a reality in front of you that you can't move.
<Page11>
"Ha, ha."
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
<Page12>
"It's -----
　It's crazy.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page13>
　The thoughts fade away.
　The nausea doesn't go away at all.
　The guilt is drying up.
　Soon, it would be in that white throat.
　To her delicious flesh muscles.
　To the throat, teeth, against the---.
<Page14>
"---- haha."
　Broken.
"Ha, ha, ha."
　I'm really broken.
　I can't do this.
　I don't know if I can stay sane any longer.
<Page15>
"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha."
　Outside.
　I have to go outside.
　If I don't, I'll kill Amber.
　If I stay in the mansion, I'll get my hands on Akiha and Jade.
　So I have to disappear before that urge comes again.
<Page16>
"'Hahahahahahaha!'
　A cage with no one in it.
　If I don't go to an empty cage, I'll go crazy again...
<Page17>
　But.
　Before that, there was a crunching sound.
　It's the sound of nails scratching the floor.
　I look up when I realize that it was from ■■■'s fingers covered in blood.
　---I want to thank God for that.
　She's still alive and well.
<Page18>
"Thank God, Amber..."
　It's a good thing that I'm not the only one who has a problem with this.
　Pale skin. I'm not sure what to say. A mouth that does not breathe.
　There.
　There is a lump of flesh that is not alive, but is trying to live.
<Page19>
"■■■■■---！！！！！！！"
　I raise an inaudible scream and run.
　I run in the scenery that I did not notice at all until now.
　The smell of blood that cannot be hidden in the corridor. It's the smell of blood.
　This is not something that was created today.
　A day, no, two days ago, it is the disastrous situation that was beaten.
<Page20>
"■■■---!"
　Past the lobby on the second floor, I jumped into the office of the west wing.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　And yet...
<Page21>
　It's more than my room, it's transformed.
　In the shade of the luxurious desk, two days have passed since death, the bodies of ■■ and ■■ were scattered.
<Page22>
"---- haha."
　It's broken.
"Ha, ha, ha."
　I'm really broken.
　I'm no good.
　I don't know if I can stay sane any longer.
<Page23>
"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha."
　Outside.
　I have to go outside.
　If this continues, you will run into the reanimated ■■-san.
　If that happens, there's no way I'll be able to maintain my ego.
<Page24>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.

　The road in front of the Tono mansion has never had many cars on it, and the only person who uses it on foot is me.
<Page5>
　Tonight it was especially lonely. The amount of traffic has decreased due to the influence of a street murderer, and most of the lights are out in the residential area below.
　Even though it's just before ten o'clock in the evening, it's as quiet as one in the morning.
<Page6>
　It was the end of October, and the wind was starting to get chilly.
　Autumn will soon be over. It would be nice if everything would be over before the freezing winter came, I said, wishing for nothing.
<Page7>
　I walk around the house.
　If you go down the slope from here, you will reach the residential area.
<Page8>
　When I head for school, I turn southwest from the residential area and head for the downtown area. If we pass through the downtown area, we will soon reach the station.
<Page9>
　Our destination tonight is the park at the south exit, so we don't need to go through the downtown area. I walk south through the residential area and pass the elevated train line that bisects the city, and I'm at the South Exit Park.
　Less than 15 minutes to go until 10:00.
　It's going to be a dark night as we don't go through the downtown area, but tonight we'll hurry to the meeting place in the shortest distance.

　On the way, I saw a black figure on the wall of the mansion.
　It's not a ...... thing that interferes with your path, but a girl in a nun's uniform leaning against the wall as if to see you off.

"Senpai, I..."
"I will not listen to excuses. The fact that you're doing this right now is an indication of your feelings.
<Page15>
"Oh, my God. I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm not sure what to do.　Oh, are you dreaming of eternal life or something sweet like that in return?
"Na---"

<Page18>
"I'm sure you'll dream about it. Everyone doesn't want to die, and wants to become strong like you.
　Yes, that's right. If I can make my body strong, I don't mind becoming Alcade's property.
<Page19>
"I'm sorry.#What?
<Page20>

<Page24>
　I walked past my seniors without turning my head to them.
　It's a ...... convenient way to say it, but right now, meeting up with Alcade is my priority.
<Page25>

<Page33>
"It's fine to be a ...... delinquent.
　Is your senior's house this way?
<Page34>
"No, not at all. Tono-kun, you've been here once before. Have you forgotten?
"I remember, I don't forget. I just wanted to check the ....... I thought I'd already passed the turning point.
<Page35>
"Yes, that's correct. You have a very good memory. The turn to my house is exactly the one I just passed.

　There are no footsteps chasing you, but just to be safe, I took a little detour and changed my route.
<Page41>
　It was not planned to come in front of the station, but if this crowd, the senior will not be able to follow easily.
　I'm going to go through the crowd and pretend I'm going to the school and go back to the elevated line. ......!
<Page42>

"I'm sure you've heard of it. ...... Yes, I have. I'm not sure what to make of that.
"This is exactly what Roa has.
　He has succeeded in reincarnation as a magic. That's what it means to die and come back to life, or to kill and not be killed."

　You can't kill them even if they kill you .......
　For example, even if you kill the vampire in front of you and feel relieved, he will be reborn as the next generation of human beings, that means.

　It is not clear how versatile reincarnation is, but if you really want to eliminate the vampire called Roa, you will have to kill all humans.

"''Most importantly, there is a limit to reincarnation.
　Basically, while Roa is still alive, he decides his next body in advance. He implants all of his previous information into the fetus of this specific bloodline.
<Page24>
"The Loa's information is kept in the shadows until the fetus reaches adulthood or becomes intelligent as a self.
　And when the reincarnated body has the appropriate intelligence to take over the "self", it will become a vampire named Roa.

　I said earlier that it is all information, but think of it as a radio wave in the name of the soul. It is the human brain that sends and receives the radio waves.
"When the body dies, the soul diffuses and is transferred to the next body. If the destination of reincarnation is fixed, it will be in that body. If not, it will be randomly transferred to a fetus that meets certain conditions.
　The excellent point of Loa is to define the metaphysical thing like the soul which cannot be measured#It's a metaphysical thing that can't be measured, and it's a thing that can be communicated.

　It was a perfect day for a walk.
　The sky was crystal clear and the sun was shining brilliantly over the mountains.
　This kind of sky is called blue sky.
<Page2>
　I stopped at the usual square and sat down on a bench.
　The bench directly behind me is occupied by someone who is reading a book in silence.
　The scene was so natural that I mistook it for a landscape.
　A man in a priest's uniform is flipping through endless pages, as if he's been doing it for hundreds of years.
<Page3>
"'Hello. It's a beautiful day."
　Anyway, we met under such a sky.
　It is a human courtesy to greet each other.
<Page4>
"Yes, it's a beautiful day. On sunny days, the sun is so strong that my eyes get tired, but the smell of the sun is still good. It's the kind of benefit of nature that we tend to forget when we stay indoors.
<Page5>
　The priest turns the page with a wry smile.
　It's not as if he had a cruel voice, but his speech was soft and full of human charm.
<Page6>
　But strangely enough, no matter how much I observed him, I couldn't see his face.
　What kind of person is he?
　I can't tell what he looked like in the beginning.
　It's like a photo that's out of focus.
<Page7>
"So, are you going to the castle?
　I felt that way somehow, so I spoke to him.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page8>
"You can find a lot more information on the web.　It is easier to continue to live as a single individual, and more importantly, you will not be bothered by others.
"It's because we reach our limits.
　Human perception, the path to omnipotence, has no end. No matter how transcendent you become, there is always another.
<Page9>
"'I have thought of understanding the perfect.
　I have tried to put my hand on the back of the Eternal.
　If that is the case, then you should pay all that you can pay yourself.
　Abandon the individual and gain history.
　I decided that even if I had to turn my initial impulse into firewood and reduce myself to ashes, I would prove the "meaning of humanity" that what had been me had set out to achieve.
<Page10>
　I don't know what he means by "the meaning of humanity".
　But it's not something so sublime.
"What is the end of the world?
　What is the tip of the human?"
　It was the result of holding on forever to a longing that everyone feels in their childhood and forgets.
<Page11>
　The wind seemed to have picked up.
　Clouds in the sky, gray sunshine in the square.
　I still can't read the expression on the face of the man in the priest's uniform.
<Page12>
"The weather is breaking. I'm going home. What about you?
"I don't have a way home. It's a one-way ticket. It looks like this is the end of the line.
<Page13>
　There was no hint of sadness in his voice.
　The man does not seem to be satisfied or disappointed.
　The sun begins to shade.
　It's almost dusk. I stood up from the bench and started my way home.
　I didn't feel like looking back, and I didn't need to.
<Page14>
"But I'll leave you with a word.
<Page15>
"There are no rainbows in the night. That's true.
　That's because it's essentially impossible.
　But...
　But what's impossible is that no one has done it yet.
<Page16>
"If you're going to set out on an unexplored course, you must remember.
　There is nothing in this world that cannot happen.
　There is nothing in this world that can't happen to you, if you can find an opportunity in your life to pay your dues.
　In the darkest of times, you can at least make a rainbow."
<Page17>
　The man in the priest's uniform is no longer there.
　One old book on the bench.
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time with us.

　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.

"............ is alive.
　The chest rises and falls in time with the breathing.
　It's a great way to get a good night's sleep.
　The yellow curtains are fluttering in the breeze.
　Outside, the sky is a stunningly bright blue.
　The temperature was as warm as early spring.
<Page20>
"I'm alive ...... me."
　It's a great way to get the most out of your time with your family.
　There is no one in the hospital room.
　I'm lying on the bed, and there's an IV needle in my right arm.
　There was a bandage on my chest and a ----
<Page21>
　I remove the IV needle and peel off the bandage on my chest.
　There was nothing unusual underneath the bandage.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　I'm not sure what to make of this. ......
　I'm not sure if I've ever had an injury that required me to wear a bandage on my chest.

　Behind the open door.
　In the empty corridor, a strange child was looking into the hospital room.
<Page23>
"...............
　You.#Before I could call out, the child walked away.

　I'm not sure what ----- that was.
"----- something."
　I feel like I'm forgetting something.

"Tono, let's go in.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page26>
"I'm sure you'll be pleased to hear that. No problem!
　It's a great way to get a good night's sleep.
<Page27>
"...... Arihiko. What are you doing?
"What?　I've been to visit Tono for a while now.
　You're asking the same question as yesterday, are you still sleepwalking?
"Who are you visiting?
<Page28>
"You know. If you're not allowed to see anyone for a month, you're going to have a hard time, but don't keep asking the same questions as yesterday.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page29>
"'............'
　Speaking of which, it came to me vaguely.
　Yesterday, I did indeed tell the doctor that
<Page30>
"Congratulations on your recovery. However, the body is slowing down, so you need to be mature."
　I think I was warned. Maybe it was the anesthesia, but I could only remember fragments.
<Page31>
"Hey, wake up now, your sleepiness ends here. You've been in the hospital for a while now, you know.
"...... Ah. Well, I can kind of understand that, but ......
　I can't remember the back and forth.
　I think.
<Page32>
"The doctor said that the patient's cognition had not yet caught up with the situation. Well, I can't help it. You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

"The third-year senior found him first thing in the morning.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page36>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　There's no reason for me to stop by the ground in the first place.

"I don't even have any club activities going on.
　I'm not sure what you mean by that. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page38>
"I'm not sure what the truth is, but Tono collapsed.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web.
　I had no choice but to call Tono's family and they took him to the hospital. After that, you were in a coma for almost a month, you know?
<Page39>
"A month in a coma... is that normal?
"Yeah, I heard the doctors were throwing up their hands. If you stay in a coma for a week, you're a vegetable.
　I'm not sure what to do. I thought my heart was going to stop when you woke up yesterday and said, "Yo, Arihiko, I'm hungry, let's eat. It was like a baton pass for a myocardial infarction.
　I'm not sure if I'm being serious or joking," Arihiko said.
<Page40>
"I'm not sure what to make of it. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

　Do you want to die voluntarily, you?

"Akiha-chan is Akiha-chan. I'm not sure what to make of that.

"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to do. I tried to bring the senior staff, but they didn't want to come because they meet at school.
"......
"Senior?"
<Page52>
"No. I've been coming here every day.
　But you, you woke up yesterday and immediately hugged me. He said he wouldn't go to the hospital anymore. He was very angry, so you should at least think of an excuse.

　I'm not sure what to say.
　You can find a lot more information on the web.
<Page54>
　It's fluffy.
　I wonder if it is because of the lack of memory and the body does not move at all for a month.
<Page55>
　Somehow, I feel that there are things missing.
　I feel that there is a thing that should not be noticed by mistake.
　There are things that should not be remembered by accident.
　And...
　I feel like there was something terribly sad.
<Page56>
　---Speaking of which, there's one more strange thing.
　I've seen this hospital room before.
　But if my memory serves me right.
　If my memory serves me right, that hospital from seven years ago should have been long gone by now.

　The next day, I came back to the mansion.
　Maybe it was because I slept for so long, but even though I was finally home, it felt like this was my first visit.
<Page58>
"'.........?'
　As I walked through the forest behind the mansion, I came upon a strange place.
"............."

　As the passenger plane landed on the runway without danger, Tono Shiki returned to his normal life.
　He returned to his mansion, Akiba gave him a small talk, and in the morning, Jade woke him up, and after receiving breakfast from Amber, he left the mansion.
<Page72>
　---But something is missing.
　I'm sad for no reason.
　I'm so sad that I feel like crying just by being like this.
　Without being able to remember the reason, I arrived at the school, which was no different from normal and peaceful.

"Yo, good morning.#You can come to school now, kiddo.''
　Arihiko said casually.

　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　There is no breathing, no twitching, no reply.
　It was a very quiet, peaceful death.
<Page136>
"------"
　I don't know how it happened. I don't even know what kind of method it was.
　The only thing we know is the result.
　A man died.
　In order to make up for that life, a woman died.
　That's all I'm saying.
<Page137>
"------.#"
　It is not the gratitude or the feeling of life that piles up in the chest.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page138>
"---, ------"
"I'm not sure, but I swear that when I'm with Tono-kun, I won't give up on myself.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　I know. I'm not sure what to do. So...
<Page139>
"Ugh...#"But let me say this as a senior.
　...... You know what? I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page140>
　...... Yes.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page141>
"...... Ugh, ......, ah, ah, ah ............!"
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure if I'm grateful for what I've done, or for the hope I have for the life ahead.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　The tears wash it all away.
　It became the last memory of this event.
<Page142>
　I can't get it back anymore, and I'm done with the sight of my beloved.
　The moon shifts, and I look at the sky until the stars disappear.
　There's no way you can see a rainbow at night.
<Page143>
"Okay.
I'm off then."
　The season is early spring.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time here.
<Page144>
"Ugh.#I've already come out, this guy!
　I'm not sure what to do. Aren't you making a lot of decisions too quickly?　What are you doing in such a hurry to live, kid?
<Page145>
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where and how to use the internet, please do not hesitate to contact us.
<Page146>
"'Acting five minutes early is a good habit. Ignore Ando's comments.
　You seem to be ...... ready to go.
　It's a little late for that, but let's make sure. Are you sure about this? It's not too late to cancel it.
<Page147>
"I'm not sure what you mean by that. I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to do. You can tell by the way he looks at you. If you're prepared to go this far, what kind of nightmare are you having every day?
<Page148>
　Mr. Karius, a man with silver hair, and
　A man who appears to be Japanese, Mr. Ando.
　The two are members of the Cathedral Church, it is said.
　It is not a substitute, but a member of the church as a congregation.
　Mr. Ando is a detective with the Metropolitan Police Department.
　Karius is a judge in his home country.
<Page149>
　It was after that night a year and a half ago that I got to know these two men.
　After I carried my senior from the ground to my apartment, these two men broke into my apartment.
<Page150>
　Armed with a pistol and a baton, respectively, the intruders told me that they had come to collect my senior. There was an altercation there, but it was settled by the appearance of their 'boss' and they have been in a relationship ever since.
<Page151>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the best results.
　I almost took off my glasses at that wild statement.
<Page152>
"I'm not sure what to make of that.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　I'd rather spend the money to preserve them so they don't rot and can rest in peace.
　In the words of the boss, there was a certain respect for the senior.
<Page153>
　It's not that I thought he was a trustworthy person. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page154>
"You want to go to the papacy?
　What the hell is that? Are you still in the Roar's fucking mind?"
　I have no interest in the Church.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with your family.
<Page155>
"Aaaah. I see. I'm sure you're right, it's the only way to get the boy in a good mood.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.　It's okay to dream like that when you're young.
　But you know what, nerd?
<Page156>
"You're not a believer. You're not one of us.
　The opportunity to enter the depths of the Church#"for decades.
　And when you do, there will be no miracles to raise the dead.
　You know this, and you join our society.
　---We have a rich homeland that does not need to be abandoned, that does not need to be hunted.
<Page157>
"Is that so?#After graduating from high school, he is going to study in Italy.
　...... It seems that no matter what you say, you will not change your mind.
　Then, for today and the rest of the day, you will be leaving the mansion.
　It is a nuisance to have someone who has no intention of contributing to the Tono family stay here indefinitely.
<Page158>
"I see.#I'm not sure what to do.#　I'm not sure what to do. I think I'll hide behind a spider too.#!
<Page159>
"But you're going to Italy, right?　It's a coincidence that I know someone there. If you're really stuck, you might want to contact this place.
I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.
I'll be back.
<Page160>
"I'm not sure what to make of that.
　Why are you so lukewarm ............#Oh, no, that's right.
　I'm not sure what to do. It's a good thing I'm not the only one.
<Page161>
"I'm not sure what to do. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　Of course, it won't be free. The money you spend will be returned to you. When I get there, you'll have to work for me at all costs.
　Don't worry, no matter how far you fall, I'll still give you a job and a place to stay.
<Page162>
"According to me, your body and mind will only last 10 years.
　You don't have much time.　You have to make sure you get at least one of your goals before then.
　The only time you and I will ever see each other like this is in Japan. If you go to your home country, we won't see each other again. I might even introduce you to my brother.
<Page163>
　And so, the senior "boss" left Japan.
"By the way. Is it true that your brother was saved by your senior in the past?
<Page164>
"Oh?　I'm not sure what you're doing by telling a lie that won't make you a dime, idiot. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　The Laurentius clan never forgets a grudge, but they never forget a favor.
　I'm not sure what to make of that. She owes him a lot of money, that woman.
<Page165>
"So... Is that really your brother's story?
"No. Good instincts and a tight tongue are the best.
　If you want to survive, you're gonna have to learn that, you little shit.
<Page166>
"All right, let's get this car rolling. Put your stuff in the trunk.
　Mr. Ando starts the engine of the luxury car.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'll do as I'm told.
<Page167>
"It's a good idea. I'm not sure what to do.
　It's not something I would normally get involved in, but if you don't mind, I'd like to hear about it.
<Page168>
"Is your principle of action the hope of self-fulfillment?
　Or is it atonement for not being able to save her?"
<Page169>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family and friends.
<Page170>
"............
"------"
　That was just my impression, it seems.
　He was a cautious, serious, and sincere person.
<Page171>
　Such a person has been associating with strangers for over a year. It is impossible not to be interested and feel close to him.
　I'm not even sure I'm ready for this. ...... I'm still being helped by the people around me.
<Page172>
"It's not about redemption. I'm not desperate, and I don't want to die.
　I made a terrible mistake once. I can't make that mistake right. As Karius-san said, you can't bring a human back to life. That is now an absolute."
<Page173>
"'Then why?　He understands that there is nothing to gain, but he is about to step into the hell where she once was.
　Isn't that atonement for your sins?"
<Page174>
"............"
　...... Indeed, when you say that, I can't say it back well.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page175>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　If Roa disappears, you can be free. He can dream like anyone else.
　---Because I foolishly believed that such hubris was for the best.
<Page176>
　It was a mistake.
　I should have stayed by her side and lived with her help, no matter how shabby and how terrible a person I would become.
<Page177>
　Because .......
　If I've made a mistake that I can't take back, I won't make it from here.
　I'm going to live my life.
　I'm going to live my life the way I think is right, the way my predecessors wanted me to.
<Page178>
"It's not that I don't like it.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page179>
　That's right. You can't throw away this happiness.
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
　It's a miracle that is unthinkable in the original life of Tono Shiki.
　No matter how improbable it is, it's only because it hasn't happened yet.
　That night, as I looked up at the night sky, I vowed to do so.
<Page180>
"I've been given more than enough happiness.
　So --- no matter what it takes, I will always return this life to her.
　That's what I'm going to spend the rest of my life doing."
<Page181>
　I don't know what it will be like.
　Is it just honor, value, or self-satisfaction?
　Still, I have to aim for the other side. To show that the life she saved will do just that.
<Page182>
"...... I see. I'm not in a position to agree with you, but I wish you the best on your journey.
　Shiki. You were someone we could have spent a year with and not regretted it."
<Page183>
　That must have been extraordinarily cheering for Mr. Karius.
　He opened the passenger door of his luxury car and sat down in it.
　He must not have said another word on the way to the airport.
<Page184>
"'Hey, can you hurry up and get in the back, please?
　I've got a flight in less than two hours!
"------"
<Page185>
　Mr. Ando hurried me to open the door of the back seat, and I got in.#I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I realize that no matter how big of a choice I make, my sensibilities will never be the same.
<Page186>
　I leave Japan with some anxiety, but with a clear mind.
　It was only for a few days, but I will see the streets of Soya, where I spent time with that person.
　...... So. It's not that I'm throwing it away or running away.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.

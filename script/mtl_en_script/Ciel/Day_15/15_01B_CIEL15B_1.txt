<Page1>
　It was a perfect day for a walk.
　The sky was crystal clear and the sun was shining brilliantly over the mountains.
　This kind of sky is called blue sky.
<Page2>
　I stopped at my usual spot and sat down on a bench.
　On the bench directly behind me, there was a visitor reading a book in silence.
　The scene was so natural that I mistook it for scenery.
　A man in a priest's uniform is flipping through endless pages, as if he's been doing it for hundreds of years.
<Page3>
"'Hello. It's a beautiful day."
　Anyway, we met under such a sky.
　It is a human courtesy to greet each other.
<Page4>
"Yes, it's a beautiful day. On sunny days, the sun is so strong that my eyes get tired, but the smell of the sun is still good. It's the kind of benefit of nature that we tend to forget when we stay indoors.
<Page5>
　The priest turns the page with a wry smile.
　It's not as if he had a cruel voice, but his speech was soft and full of human charm.
<Page6>
　But strangely enough, no matter how much I observed him, I couldn't see his face.
　What kind of person is he?
　I can't tell what he looked like in the beginning.
　It's like a photo that's out of focus.
<Page7>
"So, are you going to the castle?
　I felt that way somehow, so I spoke to him.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page8>
"You can find a lot more information on the web.　It is easier to continue to live as a single individual, and more importantly, you will not be bothered by others.
"It's because we reach our limits.
　Human perception, the path to omnipotence, has no end. No matter how transcendent we become, there is always another.
<Page9>
"'For example, the Sister who somehow got mixed up with the burial agency. You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　But even she is still bound to matter. She is bound to this universe.
　If you ask her why..."
<Page10>
"In a flash, I saved sentient beings and ascended to the throne of the demon heaven, but over there, I am a fledgling trash.
　I spent my whole life trying to gain the eyes of kami, but what they saw was not only the truth of the world, but also a lesser version of me.
　This is like making an effort to know my miserable self, what is the purpose of rebirth?
　So, I am staying here.
　No matter how small the world is, the me here is worth somewhat better than the me there..."
<Page11>
"It's silly.
　Because I have become able to perceive the outside world, I have become even more painfully aware of my own powerlessness. It's an example of the limitations of the individual.
　I wished to know everything.
　Everything in this ever-expanding universe.
　If that is the case, then what I should seek is not personal strength or happiness, but the self that will continue to exist until the end of the world."
<Page12>
　His wish is a contradiction.
　The world continues to expand.
　He says he sought eternity to know everything, but it is an endless journey from the beginning.
<Page13>
　If he's right, if the world keeps expanding.
　If we keep creating new things.
　Even if we live forever, it's impossible to know everything.
<Page14>
"No, it is possible. There will always be a conclusion. We will come to a conclusion.
　That's why we're here. We were born to define the eternity of this universe. Otherwise, we wouldn't have intelligence.
　---Even if the intelligence nurtured on this planet is of an older generation, far from understanding eternity. As long as this will lasts, I have chosen a course that will continue to chase and change."
<Page15>
　It seems that the wind has picked up.
　There are clouds in the sky and gray sunshine in the square.
　I still can't read the expression on the face of the man in the priest's uniform.
<Page16>
"The weather is breaking. I'm going home. What about you?
"I don't have a way home. It's a one-way ticket. And it looks like this is the end of the line.
　There was no hint of sadness in his voice.
　The man does not seem satisfied or disappointed.
<Page17>
"Is this the end of the line?
"Yes. My role is over.
　The only regret I have is that you could not be my enemy.
　You were the only one on this earth who had the means to kill me, but you were fatally lacking in the will to do so.
　That's why you're listening to my testament for so long like this."
<Page18>
　The day begins to fade.
　It will soon be dusk. I stood up from the bench and started my way home.
　I didn't feel like looking back, and I didn't need to.
<Page19>
"'But I'll leave you with one word.
<Page20>
"'It wasn't for me, but it will be for you.
　The hostility used not for the life of others, but for your own life.
　Just the kind of clear-cut enmity you want to be."
<Page21>
　The man in the priest's uniform is gone.
　An old book sits on the bench.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with your family.
<Page22>
"------"
　What is it? I woke up from an ominous dream.
<Page23>
　I woke up this morning, peacefully and lazily.
　The sun shining through the window is both warm and cold, and the sense of season is somewhat vague.
<Page24>
"The time is, um..."
　It was as if the weight of the body was tied to a chain.
　I managed to squeeze out my energy and get up from bed.
　You will find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page25>
"It's such a long time!
　It's too late, it's too late!
"There's no need for that, Shiki-sama.
"What's more...
　I turned around at the sudden voice.
<Page26>
　There is...
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.
<Page27>
"I'm not sure what to do. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family.
"''----''
That was it.
　Good morning, Jade. I'm not sure what to say, but I'm sure you'll understand.
<Page28>
　It's a good idea to take a deep breath and thank them. I'm not sure if I'd have been able to do it otherwise.
<Page29>
"I'm sure you'll agree. I'm glad to see that your complexion is looking good this morning.
　I'm sure you'll agree that I'm feeling better this morning.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website and see if you can find anything you like.
<Page30>
"It's a good idea to take a look at your own personal life and the way you live it.
　What kind of night owl was I?
<Page31>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're going to be doing and how you're going to do it. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
"''Ah, yes, that's right, that's right.''
<Page32>
　There was no particular assignment, no promise to meet up in the evening, and everyone said I looked good physically, so I helped with the house.
　Thanks to this, I was able to get to know Akiba, Jade and Amber.
<Page33>
"I'll go to the cafeteria after I wash my face.
　Has Akiba already done that?"
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page34>
"No, he said, to match Shiki-sama.
"I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
"What?"
<Page35>
　What's that?
　I'm sure you'll be able to figure out how to get the best out of me.
　It's scary. What happened to the guy in Akiba ......?
<Page36>
"I'm not sure what to make of it. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page37>
"I'm not sure what to make of this. It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web and also to make sure that you are getting the most out of it.

"I'm sure you're right. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.

　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　It's ...... strange.

　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at our own web site.

I'm sure you'll agree.
　I'm not sure what to do.#I'm sure you'll agree.
'No, brother, today is the day for the music room.
　He promised to play the piano for me.
Hmm, why don't we play in the courtyard?
　I'm sorry, but I can't go upstairs.
<Page44>
　I see an old mirage that I should have forgotten.
<Page45>
"------"
"......?"
　I think there was someone there.
<Page46>
"Good morning.#Good morning, Shiki.
　I'm sorry I pushed you so hard last night. I'm sorry.
<Page47>
"Good morning.
You're Amber, right?
　Good morning.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time with your family and friends.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page48>
"I'm not sure what to say.
"I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.

<Page51>
"She was so excited that she filled three wagons with foodstuffs and foreign sweets.
　But foreign sweets are unique and extreme,......, to say the least, they are rough.
　I'm sure you'll agree that the Japanese sweets made by Amber are many times better.
<Page52>
"I don't know what you're talking about.　I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.
I can't imagine such a blue cake! The innocent march of sweets that look like they were drawn with crayons in a child's mind kept stimulating my desire for creative cooking!
<Page53>
"Oh, I see. That's good to know.
　In the future, it will not be good for you to be able to demonstrate it, but the best thing is that Amber seems to be enjoying herself.
<Page54>
"I'm sure you'll agree.
　I'm not sure what to do.
It's a cookie package, no matter how you look at it.
But the picture on the package is a butter cake!
<Page55>
"And the ...... calorie count is 8000 calories .......
What does that mean? ...... A single pile of sweets, costing only 500 yen, contains 8000 calories ......
......?
<Page56>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　However,......, the butter cake was placed haphazardly in paper wrapping,......, and the Japanese idea can not be beaten in many ways,....... I'm sure you're right.
<Page57>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.　I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page58>
"I don't know.　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page59>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that. I'm dying of hunger.
<Page60>
　But I don't have any confidence that I can get a proper meal down my throat.
　I called out to Amber and moved my feet.
　Just as I put my hand on the doorknob.
<Page61>
"I'm not sure what to do.　The cafeteria is this way, right?
"Eh---that?"
　I was not going to the dining room, but to the entrance leading to the outside.
<Page62>
"It's almost time to go, but are you going out?
"No, not really.
　I'm not going to go out.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page63>
"Good morning.#Brother.
　Thank you for your hard work last night. It was rudimentary accountancy work, but it was a good refresher for me too.''
<Page64>
"''Good morning, Akiba.
　But please don't call me up with the phrase, 'I want you to teach me how to study,' and then beat me up about the inner workings of our company."
<Page65>
"Oh dear. That stuff is still terminal too.
　For the time being, I thought I'd give you an idea of how many documents I go through on a daily basis.
<Page66>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. Seriously?
　Yes, to be honest, I underestimated the responsibilities of the head of the Tono family.
<Page67>
　The final confirmation of the various projects delivered to Akiha.
　It sounds easy when you say that all you have to do is return the letter to confirm whether you can proceed with the content or not, but that decision is not one that can be made lightly.
<Page68>
　After confirming the contents of the project, measuring the solidity of the plan, and reading whether the allocation has been made correctly, it is finally possible to affix the seal.
　Akiba has other things to do, but that confirmation process alone could end his day.
<Page69>
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can contact us at .......
<Page70>
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　---By the way. Are you interested in managing a hotel in a tropical country?
"No.
<Page71>
　I want you to stop catching me with such a sweet story that I might be tempted just by listening to it. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　But that, too...
　It's not going to happen anymore.
<Page72>
"Brother?　Is there something on your mind?
　You're squinting like that. It's like you're dizzy.
"No, I'm fine. The usual poor...
<Page73>
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for a great deal more.
　You can find a lot more than just a few things to do.
<Page74>
"It's ............ strange.
　...... I've had a terrible feeling of discomfort since I woke up.
　I'm turning away from a fatal fact.
　That's good. The truth of the matter is, I don't care about that fact.
<Page75>
　I feel like I'm trying really hard not to remember something more important than that.
<Page76>
"No matter, let's have breakfast.
　After that, let's go out somewhere. Since it's a holiday, the four of us should go out sometime, and then..."
　Dead people need to go back to where they belong.
<Page77>
"It's a good idea, but there's no need to go outside the house.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to know that the party will be here and in the courtyard.
　Akiha said something strange.
<Page78>
"......?　What is a party, Akiha?
"I'm not sure what to say.
　It's your brother's birthday today.
<Page79>
　The lights in the cafeteria darken a step.
　I'm sure the sun is shining.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　That's why I have a vague sense of the season.
<Page80>
"I've heard that your schoolmates are coming to visit you this afternoon. I'll be there.
　Yumizuka-san, is it?　I heard that you are classmates, but I want to confirm what kind of person you are directly."
<Page81>
　Because.
　Regardless of the Tono family's eldest son's birthday.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page82>
　After the greeting in the living room is over, and after the chat with the tea that Amber made for you, the place is moved to the terrace.
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm sure I'll be able to.

"I'm sure there are no particular buildings in the forest. There are no buildings in the forest.

<Page87>
"Yes, Tono-kun and I are in the same class, but we've known each other since junior high school, and we sometimes work together after school.
<Page88>
"Yes?
　You're a student and you're working part-time behind my back?
<Page89>

"Gentlemen, would you like another cup of tea?"
　Amber-san came with a set of tea sets on a wagon.
"Yes, let's eat!"
　In addition to the tea, there was a small but beautiful cake on the wagon.
　In addition to the two, there is a wicked package reminiscent of a piece of brick.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page92>
"You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.

　I'm sorry.　I'm not sure what to make of this. I'm sure you'll agree. I'm not sure what to make of this.
　It's amazing!"
<Page95>
　Amber took a piece of brick, turned it over, looked at the description written in Russian, and said
"I can't even#I can't read it!
<Page96>
"Of course you can't read the instructions on foreign sweets!"
"Wait a minute, that's a really good point. ......!
　What's going on here, Tono? Your sister is a beautiful Japanese girl on the verge of extinction, and your helpers are all angels.
<Page97>
"No, hahaha."
　I agree with that opinion with all my might.
　You can find a lot of people who are interested in this type of product.
　It's an ideal house that's impeccable, the kind of place you dream of having a day like this.
<Page98>
"Oh. A rain cloud has appeared, hasn't it? Would you all like to go back to the living room?
"Yes. I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I haven't shown you the house yet. Jade, show them to the playroom.
<Page99>
"Very well, sir. Inui-sama, Yumizuka-sama, this way please.
I'll take you upstairs to the west wing.
<Page100>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page101>
"I'm glad to hear you're doing well.
　You didn't have to worry about it. You have a nice family, Tono.
<Page102>
"Yes, with a wonderful maid and an amazing sister!
　But I'm glad they're all good people. Well, I'll be going first, Tono-kun!
<Page103>
　They went back to the living room.
"Oh. Thank you, both of you.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your time with us.
<Page104>
"'?　What's wrong with you, brother? You look so scary.
　We're having so much fun.
"''Ah. Because there is no senior here."
　The world has lost its color with just that one word.
<Page105>
　It's ...... true.
　I'm not sure if it's the fact that my body doesn't work anymore.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　The only thing that matters to me is whether or not that person is there or not.
<Page106>
".................."
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
"I'm not sure what to do. I need to get back to where I belong.
<Page107>
"Sit down, brother.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time here.
　Are you going to turn your back on the reality that you are already here?
<Page108>
"It's not a good idea. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. If only the seniors were here, I wouldn't have found out so early either.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your life.
<Page109>
"'...... That's impossible.
　Because once you get to know that person.
　My brother...#　I'm sure you're not the only one.#　I don't know.
　You can't come back to this mansion anymore.

"------#I'm sorry.

　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family.
　The moment he wished to live with that person, Tono Shiki would surely meet his death.
<Page112>
"I'm not sure. So I'm dead after all.
"Yes. But even if you never wake up...
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your vacation.
　It is really a kindness that cares for Tono Shiki.
<Page113>
"Thanks for ....... But you can't stay here.
　Senpai is waiting for you. I have a promise to keep.
　I'm more than this fine, warm dream of mine."
　No matter how hard it is.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page114>
　The world is closing in.
　Everything is returning to its original image.
　In the midst of it all.
"I'm appalled.
　Really, you're always talking about other people, brother."
　The last remaining illusion disappeared as well, as he lowered his eyes sadly.
<Page115>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.

　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　If you do that, you'll be denying your own dreams, just like before.

　I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to do.
　Because you have completely ended your life."

　You will find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their lives. ----
　There is no fear or surprise. There is only regret like a jewel.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
　It was a penance for that person who ended his life without help and left it behind.

　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure if I've ever seen anything like it.
<Page123>
"There is no such thing as a dream that is completely false.
　No matter how fictional it may seem.#No matter how fictional it may seem, in the end it is only an extension of the knowledge that the person has acquired.
　So there is truth in the dream you just had.
　For example, ----"
　You're saying I've been sleeping unconscious?
<Page124>
"Yes. It's a natural consequence.
　A body that can no longer breathe. A body that was half burnt.
　That's already called 'being dead'.
　This moment is a small gap before it becomes so.
　Once this dream awakens, you will return to a coma where you will never wake up, and you will not even be able to dream."
　---Then, what's going to happen to the senior?
<Page125>
"I don't know. But don't you think it's better to think about yourself than about others?
　Don't say anything bad, just close your eyes again.
　And try not to get cold feet this time. Then you'll see a happy dream again."
　---I don't understand. Who are you?
<Page126>
"Just think about happiness, okay?
　Okay?　When you wake up, you'll be a collection of organs that can't even see your dreams.
　Then it's better to stay here and sink into a dream that's neither a dream nor a dream.
<Page127>
"You've done well so far. You've done a great job so far, and I feel sorry for this Ciel guy, but you and I have both been miserable, haven't we?
　So I think you deserve to see something as delicious as this, don't you?"
　---That's why. Who the hell are you?

"I'm not sure what to say. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　But it's not like I'm a different person from you, you know. We're just two phenomena living under one name.
<Page132>
"In the event that you have forgotten, you are of course an extension of me, Shiki. In the event that you have any questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page133>
　......... What do you want me to do with that waste?
<Page134>
"It's a good idea to stop waking up.
　The reality of Tono Shiki is the reality that he will remain unconscious in a hospital bed for the rest of his life.
　If you wake up in that state, you won't even be able to dream. The machine will take care of the maintenance of the body, but the brain will not function properly.
<Page135>
"That's death. It's not death as life, it's death as meaning.
　You'll never be in that state.
　If you can't live in reality when you wake up anyway, I'd rather you stay here and dream about reality.
　---Are you asking me to keep dreaming vague dreams instead of turning away from important things?　You think that's better for you?
<Page136>
"I don't know. You can either wake up to reality and die in a meaningful way, or you can stay here and continue to see your own dream.
　Either way, it doesn't make much difference.
　If you wake up to reality and die, you won't have to worry about this. If you're happy, you'll probably be happier that way many times over.
　---.......
<Page137>
"But I want you to see the dream.
　We have the same name, but the dreams we see are different.
　Most of the time I only see what happened on that day, or when I was eight. That may be fun, but there is no future for Shiki there.
<Page138>
"For example, the future where you grow up, find someone you like, and live a busy life.
　My reality, the knowledge I've acquired, and the future I can imagine from it are all very narrow and unsalvageable, so I can't even imagine such a thing.
<Page139>
"But your dream is different. You can't even imagine the future that you can imagine because it's so narrow and unsalvageable. That's what I call dreaming.
　In addition to the fact that, as I said before, my years are too small to be able to come up with such a wonderful dream.
　Oh, it's really wonderful. The only treasure I have that you don't is the memory of playing with my cat in the garden.
　---.............
<Page140>
"See? Now you know how good it feels to be imaginary.　Then just close your eyes.
　If you can't stand your own dream, I'll lend you a hand. I can offer you something from the past that you've forgotten.
　If we try hard enough to fool each other, we'll find a reasonably happy ending."
　---...................
<Page141>
"...... You don't seem to be in the mood. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to try to wake up when things get cold.
　But your reality is over, you know.
　It's true that the reality you see in Yume is nothing compared to the real reality. Even so --- if you work hard, you can be at least a little bit happy."
　---...... No.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page142>
"...... You're an idiot. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. I'm not sure what to make of it. As a result, you will lose sight of what is good and what is bad.
　The fact is, you and I didn't do anything wrong.
　And yet, the result is this, isn't it?　You see, Shiki is that kind of person. You should not want someone else's happiness because your life is full of deprivation.
<Page143>
　---Even if that's the case.
　I promised myself that I would never be alone again.
　If the scene you just saw and the person you are doing this to is all a dream,----, then you need to get back to where you belong.
<Page144>
"When the dream is over, what if there is nothing?
　---It's not nothing.
　There is no such thing as nothing, Shiki.
　Even though the world is still torn apart and there is no eternity.
　You will find a lot of people who are looking for a new way of life.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page145>
"...... So. Then it's goodbye. I'm not sure what to make of this.
　But it was fun. It showed me a good dream that I could have a life like that in the future.
　---What the hell?
　It's so weird that you suddenly shook my hand.
<Page146>
"Haha, it's weird for me too. But I can't help it, because I can't give it to you unless I do this. Even if you are the same person, if you are so divided, you need to have an image of 'touching'.
　---It's a little ...... you're disappearing.
<Page147>
"You are beginning to take shape, aren't you?
　Well, then, this is where I leave you.
　I'll forget about you, so you can forget about me too.
　There's no point in going back to the Shiki I knew before Shiki Tono."
　---.
<Page148>
"Oh, that's right. As for her, I like her too.
　I agree with your opinion that she's more important than you.
　But you know what? Then don't ever make me cry again by doing something stupid."
<Page149>
　---Then, he disappeared.
　No, I guess it's more like a feeling of having passed away.
　...... prickly, a strange pain runs.
　It is something that I miss and can never get back.
　After all.
　It's a great way to get a sense of what's going on in your life.
<Page150>
".................."
　I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your time.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　The only thing that is there is yourself dying, not even dreaming anymore.
<Page151>
　--- Dimly.
　The light of the morning is reflected.
<Page152>
　Self-consciousness that is fuzzy.
　I can't think of anything yet.
　The body has collapsed.
　My head is on something soft.
　---It's strange.
　The dream should have cooled down by now.
<Page153>
　I open my eye lid.
　In front of me, there was her, crying face.
<Page154>
"--------"
　I reached out my ...... hand and touched her cheek.
　Tears trickled down my fingertips.
　It was a warm incapacitation that was unmistakably only real.
<Page155>
"--------"
　...... She didn't say anything to me.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page156>
　The heart is certainly beating.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page157>
　Was it the benefit of the ...... vampirized body, did she heal it, or was the loss itself an illusion?
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can contact us at the web site.
<Page158>
"A lot of the time, it's a good idea to take a look at your own personal life.
　I'm not sure what to say.
<Page159>
"You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing. I've never seen you cry before.
"Yes. For the first time in my life, I'm crying because I'm happy.
"I see. Well, that's a precious scene to witness.
<Page160>
　This is a great way to make sure you get the most out of your vacation.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　There is no headache. There is no pain. I have no idea what happened to Roa or myself.
　The only things that are certain are the morning sun that makes you squint and her body heat that is just as bright.
<Page161>
"...... I'm glad. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
<Page162>
"I'm not sure what you're talking about.
I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　The senior makes a mischievous smile with a giggle.
<Page163>
"I'm sure you'll agree.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website and see if you can find anything you like.
<Page164>
　You can find a lot more than just a few things to do.
　It's not only that, but the sun is strangely bright. This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page165>
"You should not move yet,......!
　It's only the bare minimum that's been restored!　You need to stay put for another hour!
<Page166>
"......, senior. Do you realize that you're contradicting yourself?
"I'm not sure what to make of it. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your investment.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page167>
"This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
　I'm going to be bored like this for another hour.
<Page168>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page169>
"I'm sorry. I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page170>
"...... What are you talking about? It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page171>
"...... And also, you know.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
"Oh, ------.
<Page172>
　---I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page173>
"This is a great way to get the most out of your money. I want to do that now, too.
　The only arm that is free is a hand on her cheek.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　Our lips touch each other deeply.
　It was the second time we kissed, as if we were exchanging our lives.
<Page174>
　After what seems like an hour of kissing, she and I part our faces.
"---------"
　There are no ...... words.
　Just, really, finally.
　I woke up from a long dream.
<Page175>
"...... Good morning Ciel, for now."
"Yes. Good morning, Tono-kun."
<Page176>
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page177>
"I'm not sure what to say.　Tono-kun, Tono-kun ......!
"It's a great way to get a good night's sleep.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page178>
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page179>
"In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to use it to buy a lot of things.
"---- Mmm."
　This is a great way to get the most out of your day.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page180>
"I'm not sure what to say. This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
"I'm not sure if that's a good idea.
<Page181>
　You're going to have to miss school.
"It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I've got a lot of questions for Tono-kun anyway.
<Page182>
　---I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page183>
"In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to take advantage of the fact that you'll be able to get a lot more.
<Page184>
"I reject it. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page185>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page186>
"It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web.
　It's also a good idea to take measures against it.
Well, ..................#It's very convenient for me because the miracle of  has become easier to communicate.
<Page187>
"I'm sorry. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　You said something about chastisement for vampires, didn't you?
<Page188>
"I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not sure what you're talking about. ...... and the sunshine is still painful.
　We'll move on soon. The sun has just risen, and if you hurry, you won't be seen by others.
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page189>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website and see if you can find anything you like.
　I think I'm going to make it to my apartment in no time.
<Page190>
"............... wind."
　What can I say, after all this time I realize that I've fallen in love with an amazing person.
<Page191>
　But well, I'm prepared for that too.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money to spend, you'll be able to take advantage of the fact that you'll be able to get a lot more out of it.
<Page192>
　I'm not sure what's wrong with that.
　I've decided to stay with this person.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.

　After that is done safely, the next step is...
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
<Page195>
"Did you say something, Tono-kun?
"Yes. I was thinking about how to get my senior to call me by my name. It's a good time to make a decision. I'll like you even more."
"E------"

　Because right now, there is a guardian god of this town who is working harder than when dealing with any vampire.
<Page198>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to say.
　Shh, shh, shh..."
　The sun rises.
　I can't wait to put a lid on her lips and make a third promise to each other.
<Page199>

　---That's the last thing I remember about the dark night.
　　　　It became an important memory to welcome the new dawn.
<Page200>
　Nevertheless, there are many problems, and the number of memories must increase in the future.

　Even if the touch of death doesn't disappear, if there's someone more important than me, I'm sure I can cross the night.
　The adventure will go on for a long, long time.

　May its end be a good one.

<Page15>
　For the sake of Amber's honor, I'll say that this stuffed shiitake mushroom is the most delicious thing I've ever experienced.
　When I told Amber about it, she said
<Page16>
"Thank you, sir. But this victory is only natural.
　Tonight's ingredients were sent directly from the place of production, and I'm afraid to say that they are gems that have been presented to the Emperor of Japan.
　I see. I knew it was an expensive shiitake mushroom.
<Page17>
"So.
　How did you spend your afternoon off, my brother, after you worked so hard on my work?
"Heh?　Ah, ah, you mean me. I went for a walk in the afternoon, and when I got back to my room I lay in bed all day."

"You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　You can find a lot more information on the web.
　But Akiha doesn't think anything of it, why?"

　I know from the beginning that my brother is that kind of person."
<Page23>
"..............."
　It's a great idea.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　This is exactly what I mean when I say that I am not disappointed.
<Page24>
"No, thank you for the food."
"Thanks for the food. I have some lessons to learn after dinner, so I'll leave you to it.
　Brother?　I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.

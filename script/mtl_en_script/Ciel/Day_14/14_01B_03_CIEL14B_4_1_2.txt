"Yes, you should be ashamed of yourself.
　　I can't stop it. It's too late."
<Page2>
　The huge white body strides through the valley of buildings.
　While glaring at the world of tiny humans.
　It's like a machine that reaps ears of rice.
　It's like a machine that reaps ears of rice, she said to herself, lifting her mouth.
<Page3>
"I've expanded a lot, but, well.
　　It's not a problem for me now.
　　It's only a few steps to school.
<Page4>
　It was not a fight to begin with.
　It's not the individual he knows.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web.
　It should have been that way.
<Page5>
"---Yes.
　　I'm not going to be conscious of it.
　　I won't even notice him until the end."
<Page6>
　That was the least she could do.
　The only one she sees as an enemy is Ciel.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page7>
　I'm not going to even look back because it's not important.
　I'll never talk to him like that again.
　And yet...
<Page8>
""------"
　I've been looking for the words for a long, long time.
　I hate it. I hate you. I hate it. I don't want you to take even one step toward me.
<Page9>
　And yet, I was happy and sad.
　I was happy and frightened.
　The conflicting orientations, the back-to-back logic errors.
　It told me that I wanted him to be more and more concerned.
<Page10>
　But the only voices that come through are the ones about Ciel and swearing at yourself.
　I'm not sure what to say, but I'm going to say it.
　I'm not sure if I'd be able to keep my cool with that.
<Page11>
"What? What? What? What the...!"
　Even so, until just now, she was able to hold back.
　You can find a lot more information on the web.
<Page12>
I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to do.
　When you are hiding in the roots, escaping from your own feet, you can still afford.
　I thought it was a waste of time, a meaningless attempt to buy time.
<Page13>
　However. The moment it turned out that the purpose was to "kill the earth vein", what ran through her whole body was a shiver and joy.
<Page14>
"That's my murderer, ......!"
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's not just the storage of events in the light body.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are able to get the most out of your vacation.
<Page15>
I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not.
<Page16>
I'm not sure what to do.
　The next moment, the joy is gone.
　This is what it means to be up and down.
　She took everything from it.
　Hope, pride, the future, and physical strength.
　I literally had it in my hands.
<Page17>
I'm not sure what to do.
　The short-lived joy was replaced by a fiery emotion.
　I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to do. I'm so glad I did.
　I'm jealous. I'm jealous. I'm jealous. ......!
<Page18>
"Stand there and watch.
　　"I'll stomp out your memories
　　I'll stomp out your memories."
<Page19>
　That emotion was the last thing off limits.
　She can't stop her emotions.
　It was the natural state of life, where nothing was impossible.
<Page20>
　She is different from human.
　Although she is human, she does not have the function of self-control that humans have.
　What she imagines is put into action without hesitation.
<Page21>
　The slightest animosity, an idea, a prank, a joke.
　Every imagination is carried out by the body.
　Even joking around with him. Or taking it out on Ciel.
　And the unforgivable tyranny of becoming yourself in a light body.
<Page22>
I'm not sure what to do.
　　You can't control me after all."
<Page23>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　The casing of light that existed as a function
　It is not allowed on earth.
<Page24>
　This is a phenomenon that is not allowed on earth.
　If a nerve passes, a load is born.
　When we have flesh, we have pain.
　When blood flows, it creates the definition of life.
<Page25>
"I was ...... getting more and more sore."
　The weight is added to the foot that steps out.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your time and money.
<Page26>
I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to do.
　But you can't stop.
　You can't stop yourself once you've started moving.
<Page27>
　She can't stop herself. There is no function to stop it.
　She wished that someone would stop her, and
<Page28>
"Shiki."
　She said that name, which she had decided not to say anymore.
<Page29>
"I want Shiki. I'm not a fan.
　　I want Shiki to stop me.
　　No.
　　I've been thinking about it for a while.
<Page30>
　I've always been aware of it. I'm not sure what to do.
　You can find a lot more than just a few of them.
<Page31>
　In the first place, she was able to feel his heart more than he did.
　---He wanted to kill her, but he didn't have any hostility.
　---He was angry, but there was no hatred anywhere.
　He was the scariest, funniest, most special person she had ever known.
<Page32>
""------"
　But this was really the end.
　It's not like she's going to be able to get rid of him.
<Page33>
I'm not sure what to do.
　　---I'm not sure what to do.
<Page34>
　I'll be back. I'll be back.
　I'm not sure what to do with it.
　It doesn't matter.
　A few more steps. A few more steps and I'm at school.
　I'm going to crush him with a mighty stomp," he says.
<Page35>
　But if you want to.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

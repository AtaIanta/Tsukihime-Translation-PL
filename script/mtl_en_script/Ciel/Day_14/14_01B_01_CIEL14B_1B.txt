　The restraint is released.
　I'm not sure if the line of the throat is cut and temporarily weak, Alcade does not move.
　I took the opportunity to get out from under her and distance myself while I still could.
<Page2>
"Ha ...... is, ha ......!"
　Once I was free, I was finally able to resume breathing.
　Breathing on both shoulders, I calmed my heart and brain anyway.
<Page3>
　Now I can't run without a few seconds of rest.

"Al-Quade ......?"
　The abnormality doesn't stop there.
　Blood. You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page7>
　It is the sea of blood that overflowed from Alcade.
　It looked like a pit-like wound made in the world itself.
<Page8>
　The red blood is still spreading on the cobblestones.
　The white body is tainted by the poison, and is invaded by the evil vermilion color.
　I remember this scene.
　That dull, glowing pool of blood is...
<Page9>
"...... Oh no. No way, no how."
　---I'm not sure what to do.
　Did I kill him?
　That's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. Such nonsense. ......!
<Page10>
　It is not the same as that time, the "line" was barely visible on the neck.

"---Fushigi. It was the neck that stopped.
　It's the neck that stopped, but it's the chest that's giving me trouble."
　It wasn't a word, it wasn't a sensation, it was like a breath.
　It was the melting of natural will.
<Page13>
"It hurts. It hurts. I love you. It hurts. I'm happy.
　It's hot. It hurts. I still love ......!"
"But what you can't have is the same as what you can't have.
　It's the other way around. I can't have it because I can't find it anywhere."
<Page14>
"But I was rejected. I was compared. Killed in cold blood.
　Again. Again. Again. And again.
　Then I'll do the same."
"No. There's nothing. There's nothing. Nothing.
　That guy never existed in the first place. ......!"
<Page15>
　At this time.
　I'm sure I heard the sound of the world creaking.
<Page16>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.

　You can see the eyes between the golden hair.
　You can see the eyes between the golden hair and the black pierced eyes of the crusty old head.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page20>
"I'm going to kill you.
<Page21>
　---What the hell is this?
　The stone ground, the streetlights, the buildings, and all the artifacts built on the surface of this earth are sliding down towards him.
<Page22>
　Like taking off a decoration.
　As if to dissolve paint.
　As if peeling off the skin of the world, all things are confiscated from their way of being.
<Page23>
　It's a phenomenon that I can't comprehend, and he's shouting it out loud.
"This is the power of the true ancestors. An imaginary embodiment that transforms the surface of the earth as it pleases as the touch of a star.
　It's the end of this city. This realm is finished. The buildings and creatures will be transformed. They are crushed and swallowed from four dimensions into two dimensions. From event transformation to event storage. What comes after that is the inland sea of stars that have given up on you and moved on. Praise. Fear. Kneel and prepare for death. Now... one more push, and your world will be turned inside out!"
<Page24>
"Al-Quaid."
　Her eyes saw nothing.
　She tries to stand up with one hand, but her strength still hasn't returned, and she falls down with a splash of blood.
　Each time she does, her body turns red.
　Again and again.
　It's a great way to get up, slip and fall.

　The world turns in circles.
　In the midst of this, her thoughts come in.
<Page26>
"I've never experienced such humiliation.
　I've never experienced such humiliation.
　---That's why it's pleasurable.
　I can't imagine how good it will feel when I hit Shiki with this body-scorching rage and beat him. It must be fun. It's really fun. I'm sure it's so much fun you could trade the world for it. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm so happy. I won't hold back anymore. I won't miss it anymore. I can't wait any longer. I'm going to tear off my limbs, ravage my ribs, wrench out my guts, call for help, stomp down my throat, cut open my skull, and paint my brain on the ground at that moment: -----! "
<Page27>
"Wait for me, I'll kill you soon ......!"
　Laughing, laughing madly all the while, Alcade struggled in a pool of his own blood.
<Page28>
"------"
　I can't move.
　You can't move.
　My soul is hardened to the core.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　We have to go.
　It doesn't matter where we are, if we don't get out of here soon, we're gonna get killed.
<Page29>
"----- Ah."
　But my legs won't move.
　The world is no longer a shadow of its former self because of me...no, it has become a world of shadows, and every event has been taken away.
<Page30>
　The buildings. And people. Everything was made into a flimsy picture and taken away.
　In that world, only me and him are three-dimensional.
<Page31>
　He won't forgive me. I won't store it like other events.
　He wanted to tear me apart alive, so he left me out.
　He left me alone in this town and erased all other creatures in that hole.
<Page32>
"Oh... oh."
　It was useless. Everything I tried to do was lost in this.
　I had claimed to protect the city, and I killed it.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　I'm not sure where to run to anyway.
　I'm sure you understand that you will definitely be killed.
<Page33>
"Tono-kun!　What are you doing? It's this way!
　---That voice.
　With that voice, I was freed from fear.
<Page34>
"Senpai ......!"
"''Just hurry up and run away ......!
　Before her resuscitation finishes, quickly!"
"Ah ----!"

　No, cheater, this is not the time for that.
<Page39>
"I apologize for leaving the room, but it was a misunderstanding!
　I couldn't take it anymore, so I went outside, and Alcade was there, and he said something weird about wanting me for himself.
<Page40>
"Ugh, you'll have plenty of excuses later!

"Senior, in front!"

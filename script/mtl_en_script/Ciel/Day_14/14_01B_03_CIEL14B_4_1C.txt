　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your vacation.
　My fingertips are numb from lack of oxygen, and my left hand, which carries my body, has become immobile.
<Page2>
　The lines of death are converging.
　Then it should be in this ...... vicinity.
　If we can reach that point as soon as possible---
<Page3>
"I have a toy that won't die even if I kill it."
　---I'm sure you'll be pleased to hear that.
　...... Damn, I'm going to lose consciousness from anger before I run out of oxygen.
<Page4>
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　It's not even to flush me out.
　He's just trying to harass me.
<Page5>
"I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out. I knew I had to kill Loa herself.
　　You're not going to die, are you, Ciel?"
　He ruined my senior year just to pass the time. ......!
<Page6>
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　You'll be able to get a lot more than that.
　You're playing with my most precious thing in a roundabout way. ......!
<Page7>
"Yeah. I feel sorry for you. You can't get what you want.
　　I'm going to take the loa this time.
　　I'm going to take the loa this time, that lump of flesh that can't do anything but run away.
　　"......!"
<Page8>
"------"
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　The loss of the feeling of being alive.
<Page9>
"Hey. You're overstepping boundaries.
　I don't know. Kill it. I'm gonna kill him. Whatever it is, I'm gonna kill it, no questions asked...!
<Page10>
　Look.
　This is not the time to be worrying about Roa.
　I won't let him hurt you anymore, not even a finger.
<Page11>
　Look.
　Give your brain enough stress to burn out the blood vessels, and stare.
　Look. Look. Look. Look.
　I was going about it all wrong.
I'm not sure what to do with it.
<Page12>
"------"
　You're right.
　The death of life. I'm not sure what to do. You can see the death of space.
　You can't see lines in a glowing body.
　The Alcade has no cause for death yet.
<Page13>
"What, are you trying to kill yourself?"
<Page14>
　A condescending voice says.
　No, no. Don't be fooled. She has no such pride. It is because he felt that I was in danger that he now turned his red eyes to the ground.
　It was drawn to me by a single, insignificant ant.
<Page15>
　So hurry up. I already know the answer.
　I realized it when I entered the city only a few minutes ago.
<Page16>
"---Okay. I'll play with the bugs over here later."
<Page17>
　It doesn't need to take blood from other life like the Dead.
　Someone once told me that it was a perfect life just to be there.
　As an extension of nature, the true ancestors can raise as much vitality as they want from the ground of the world.
　That's why it never dies. There is no limit.
<Page18>
"----"
　In other words.
　Is that perfection only above the natural world?
<Page19>
"?"
　It can read our thoughts.
　There's no hiding it.
　That's why we've crawled so far to avoid thinking clearly.
<Page20>
　It's over. I'm not sure what to make of it.
　But he still can't get the message. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page21>
"I see it!
　I crawl out of the grass roots.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page22>
"------"
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's too late. One second to reach. Suck it up. It's because it's so bloated that it moves so slowly. It takes too long for the signal to travel to your limbs.
<Page23>
　We'll get there in that one second.
　Just this one end, just this perimeter.
　I was wrong.
　Alcade has no cause for death.
　Then...
<Page24>
　If we kill the thing that's eliminating that factor first, then he'll lose his integrity...!
<Page25>
　We've reached the big point.
　I've won this time.
<Page26>
"------"
　The eyeball burns. The right hand that was raised creaked.
　You can say that the point is the life of the earth's veins.
　I'm not sure if you've heard of this, but I'm sure you've heard of it.
"You mean that?"
<Page27>
　---The knife, cut the air.

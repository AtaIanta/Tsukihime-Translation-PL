　I'll take Rohr's advice to heart.
　You can rely on Roa's explanations, even if you don't like them at all.

　The air is dense with coughing.
　A city that expands. The claws of the air current that descends on the approaching thing.
　The situation is already outside of human understanding.
　On my own, I would have fallen into a panic long ago.
<Page3>
　I kick the ground, which used to be a road, even harder.
　The speed is over 50 kilometers per hour.
　We stepped into the gap as if we were breaking through a wall of air that clung to us.
　We stepped into the gap.

　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page5>
　The sky is red, red without the slightest gap.
　The city whose surface has been stripped away is silent like a tombstone.
　In the middle of it, a huge shadow that violates common sense is reigning.
<Page6>
　What is that thing?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　The intellect refuses to understand.
　What is that thing?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Fear refuses to think.
　What is that thing?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　My memory refuses to recognize it.
　Why is that thing manifesting itself in a human city?
<Page7>
"It's a religious manipulation.
　To those who worship it from afar, it gives the impression that it's a scary, incomprehensible thing.
　And to those who worship from afar
　To those who worship from afar, it gives the impression of 'beauty and understanding
　beautiful and understandable.
　God only shows a glimpse of his truth to those who kneel at his feet.
<Page8>
　Rohr's words skim the surface of my thoughts.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　It's not bizarre at all.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page9>
　That building was claimed to be 100 meters tall.
　So you're saying it's a giant over 100 meters?
<Page10>
That's right. Her consciousness is probably in the center of that light.
　I'm sure you'll be able to find something that will help you.
"The image of herself that she envisions is being projected and diffused.
　I'm sure you've already heard of it.

<Page11>
　---It was a nightmare that materialized.
　In a skeletonized city, only we are alive.
<Page12>
　A human city that has lost its human life.
　In the dead city where only emptiness spreads, there is no life force at all.
　Even the vines that cover the buildings have lost their color.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page13>
"......
　The pressure almost stops you in your tracks.
　It's a great way to get rid of a lot of life, but only one heartbeat covers the city.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page14>
　No. It's not like that. In fact, this is a giant's garden.
　It reminds me of a fairy tale I read as a child.
　In the garden of giants, people who wander in are without exception helpless.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.

　It's ironic. I never thought I'd see the day when this line would inspire me.
　And...
<Page17>
　The reason we're going up against that Titan.
　I didn't see it until I entered the surface consciousness.
　I'm going to face my primary objective.
<Page18>
　You're trapped. You're being held captive by that Titan.
　With that overwhelming power, my senior was now being repeated death and rebirth.
<Page19>
　I heard a sound in the back of my brain, a click.
　I'm sure it was the sound of a safety device coming off.
<Page20>
　Blood poured into the limbs that had almost stopped.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.

<Page23>
It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　Don't run on the ground without thinking. Hide yourself behind a rock.
<Page24>
　As much as I wanted to, I couldn't reach my senior with that.
　It is 300 meters to that giant by eye measurement.
　The actual distance to get closer is ten times that.
　It's a great way to get a better idea of what's going on in your life.
<Page25>
I'm sure you'll agree. I'm sure you're aware that it's impossible.
"------"

I'm not sure what to say. I don't understand.
　I'm not sure what to do. The ground route is a dead end.
"You're telling me to jump on top of a building?
　That's exactly how he'll see us.
<Page30>
It's a good idea to avoid the front and go around it.
　It will add distance, but it's the only possible route.
<Page31>
　I cluck my tongue at the plausible opinion.
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page32>
"I'm not sure how to get to the top of the building though. It just looks like a building, but it doesn't have an entrance or stairs, you know?"
<Page33>
'I still haven't lost my human common sense.
　I'm not sure what to do. If you can't imagine jumping through a thousand valleys, you'll never get close to the light body.
"You want me to jump on my own?
<Page34>
You can only jump a height difference of 20 meters with you.

"The more you work as a vampire.
　I'm not sure what to do.

　I'm sure you'll be fine.
"------"
　For a moment, a pause.
<Page38>
"So...
So?"
I'm sure it was a stupid question.
　Then you can hurry up.

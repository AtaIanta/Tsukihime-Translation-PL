You have ten seconds to recover your strength.
　That's the last sand in the hourglass you have left.
<Page2>
　I don't need Rohr to tell me that.
　A sprinter challenging for a new record.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for and what you can do to help.
　This is the last time you will be challenged as a vampire/human,.......

"---, ------
　It's a good idea to take a deep breath for 10 seconds before putting your fate on the line.
<Page4>
　One second. The oxygen inhalation activates the blood. The muscle fibers that had been severed and the blood vessels that had been fully hardened were loosened and joined together.
<Page5>
　Two seconds. Measure the distance to the light body while focusing the nerves on repairing the body.
<Page6>
　Three seconds. The shortest distance is 400 meters by eye. Actual distance traveled is four kilometers.
<Page7>
　Four seconds. One minute to reach the glowing body. We needed a minimum of ten seconds to regain that minute's strength.
<Page8>
　Five seconds. I suppressed my impatience and concentrated on breathing. Even as I'm doing this, the Titan is heading towards the school building.
<Page9>
　Six seconds. Even as I do this, the glowing body is walking towards destruction.
<Page10>
　Seven seconds. If he ignores me as thoroughly as he has in the past, or if he is conscious of me, his interference will be nothing compared to what it has been in the past.
<Page11>
　Eight seconds. My body stiffens at the realization.
<Page12>
　Nine seconds. Is it worth it? I wondered if that woman was worth putting her beloved woman behind her and offering her life.
<Page13>
　---Ten seconds.
　No need to think about it.
　I cut off all thoughts and began my final chase.
<Page14>
　The Titans strutted through the forest of buildings.
　I bounce through the valley of buildings.
<Page15>
　It's easy to get close to the glowing body.
　The buildings, sucked in by the event storage, speed up my speed as I try to approach the glowing body. It's like a tailwind pushing my back.
<Page16>
　The back of the body of light is approaching.
　I don't try to go around it, nor do I try to escape.
　Straight away, I catch sight of its white body.
　In my left hand, I am still holding a knife that is less than a needle for him.

　He extended his right arm to a building 60 meters away.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page22>
"---, ---!"
<Page23>
"----!"
<Page24>
　I reach right in front of the maelstrom.
　Beyond this point, there are only light bodies. The only building that can be used as a foothold is at the rear.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.

"Gravitational manipulation.
　"gravitational manipulation, continuous installation on the bedrock at 160, 250, 300 meters.

　A lot of debris was thrown up in the air.
　The footholds of the floating islands...

"One minute has passed.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　...... Good work.
　I'll take the shot, you take the control.
　We reached that point as if we were falling into the sky.

I'm not sure what to say.

<Page35>
I'm not a fan.
　I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what to do with it.
　You can't even bake bread with that character.
　You'll never be able to do micro-level precision work with a personality that can't even bake bread.

　He has been reincarnated 17 times.
　The genius who has built a "new depth of magic" each time.
　I'm not sure if you've heard of it or not.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
<Page37>
I'm not sure if you'll be able to do it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　But you need a relay point to aim at.
　400 meters above the glowing body.
　There's a living force field that adjusts the angle of fire.
<Page38>
　The star of the execution table lights up in the sky.
　As if enchanted by its radiance, she raised her emotionless face and said.
<Page39>
"You can have me.
　---It's a one-time residue. Don't miss it, Tono Shiki.
　The last remaining arrow.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.
<Page41>
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
　All I have to do is bend it once, using you as a fulcrum.
　Put your hand on it and drop it down.
　Any sorcerer could do it, it's a simple task."
<Page42>
"Zu, aaahhhh ......！！！！"
　A whip of raging charges.
　It can't even hold the reins, let alone guide it right down. ......!
<Page43>
　It's not like precision work.
　It's like threading a needle through a dam's worth of water.
　You have to be strong to withstand the water pressure.
　If you're not delicate, you can't set your sights. ......!
<Page44>
　Can you control a rampaging bull with a pair of chopsticks?
　No, you can't.
　It's impossible to correct the trajectory. It's impossible to adjust the angle of fire.
　It's a dream to hit his body with this. ......!
<Page45>
　I can't match it. We can't set it. We can't control it. ......!
　It's over. It's over. It's over.
　The last chance is lost. The fires of the sun will be consumed as they are, burning away the ground that has nothing to do with it.
<Page46>
"Huh...!"
　It will be ruined like this.
　Roa is silent. You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of. I don't feel any will. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　Roa, the reincarnated one, really left this blow to me and disappeared.
<Page47>
　The only one here is me. Only Tono Shiki.
　There's nothing else I can rely on.
　I'm not going to be able to do that.
<Page48>
"Huh."
　---That's right.
　I'm sorry. It's when you're in a pinch that you need to think things through.
　I can't make minor adjustments.
　I can't tame the flow of this power.
<Page49>
　Of course not. It's a false premise.
　You can't control the forces of nature with precision and accuracy.
　What we can do is to take our time. Compromise. To take detours, but to arrive at the end with greed.
<Page50>
　Yes.
　It's not about being precise, like a genius, without wasting a minute...
　It's about developing a process that spans the longest amount of time rather than the shortest.
<Page51>
　Operate bigger and bigger.
　The idea should be free.
<Page52>
　If the world is big, the handling should be rough.
　Don't fight against the enormous water pressure.
　Don't resist the flow of power that gushes out, hold it up, and
<Page53>
　I can do it.
　This is the last...
<Page54>
　---It was an encounter that lasted no more than a second.
<Page55>
　Roa said.
　The light body is a test of human perception.
　The farther away it is, the more "terrible" it appears.
　The closer you are to it, the more it shows you the truth.
<Page56>
　---That's why.
　When your skin is close enough to touch, and your eyes are close enough to meet, you can finally catch a glimpse of the truth.
<Page57>
　---How beautiful.
<Page58>
　I remember the very first emotion.
　I remember the emotions I carved into my heart over and over again.
　I remember the moonflower that forgave me for being a murderer.
<Page59>
　At a time like this, or perhaps because of a time like this, I realize just how fragile I am.
　In the future, no matter what happens, no matter who you love, Tono Shiki will feel this creature is beautiful in a different way.
<Page60>
　I'm not going to be able to ...... dream about it, though.
　I'm in love with that dream for the rest of my life.
　Like a flower blooming in the chest, the fate that never met.
<Page61>
　The fire of Calvaria pierces the giant that reigns in civilized society.
　From the top of the brain to the earth.
　The light bullets penetrate to the big hole drilled in its feet, and
　The white body becomes a particle and diffuses.
<Page62>
　There is no feeling of victory.
　There is no elation of having done it.
　---Because this far is "within the realm of possibility".
<Page63>
　He said.
　If only we could defeat the glowing body.
　It was a sincere declaration, though it was full of traps.
<Page64>
　Winning is not the end of the world.
　The hard part is cleaning up afterwards.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　In other words, what happens from here on out is...
<Page65>
　The ability to update the planet's surface.
　Like an unknown fog clearing, the majesty of the light body disappeared.
<Page66>
"---Coming."
　At that moment.
　As if I knew that it was natural, without knowing it, I muttered so.
<Page67>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　You can find a lot more than just a few things that you can do with your money.
　The time for change has come.
<Page68>
　A celestial egg.
　A planetary memory.
　The boy who wanted to know everything.
　The man who tried to define eternity, the love of God.
　The opportunity has been lost, but a part of that hope is now on the surface of this earth.
<Page69>
"Oh..."
<Page70>
　Space is overwritten.
　The entire sky is on fire. A dazzling light is emitted.
　It's impossible.
　It can't be the view looking up from this planet.
<Page71>
　Space is inherently dark.
　Even if infinite stars are shining.
　It is because there is not enough density and time to illuminate the infinite vastness of the universe.
<Page72>
　The universe as seen from the earth is only 13.8 billion light years worth of information. It is impossible to illuminate the dark and cold universe with that amount of light source.
<Page73>
　But what if we assume that the expanse of the universe is still very small?
　If there is such a thing as ■■■■■■.
　It's the first time I've ever seen anything like it.
　A crimson space is released.
<Page74>
"Oh..."
　This is a universe of concepts.
　It is a realm that life on Earth has no memory of.
　A law beyond the reach of human observation.
　The infinitesimal, smallest, deepest hollow in the sky.
<Page75>
　In the midst of this torrent, with only one exception, I am falling at a speed that is unreal.
<Page76>
　The first cosmic speed that is in opposition to the planet's gravity.
　A second cosmic velocity that escapes the planet's gravity.
　And the third universe speed, which flies away from even the gravity of the sun...
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
<Page77>
　So many stars, so many beginnings, passing by.
　Events that humans will never see, even over the life of our species, are passing us by.
　It doesn't matter. I'm not even interested.
　All I can see now is that glow.
<Page78>
"That thing...!"
　The landing point is determined by gravitational manipulation.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page79>
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
　It's no wonder they are defenseless. I was literally stripped naked.
　However, if you look at the fact that it is only the central part that has dissipated, this state will not last long.
　The light body will soon return to normal.
　It's a good idea to dismantle the heart before that.
<Page80>
"Huh. ---------!"
　You can't stay in the heart at this speed.
　The contact is only momentary. We can only pass each other as we fall.
<Page81>
　---Prepare for contact.
　---The right hand that holds the knife is positioned on the chest.
<Page82>
　---It is not a mistake to say "heart".
　Neither the point of death nor the line of death can be seen.
　The beating of life.
　It is the source of everything, and the graveyard of the star that returns at the end.
　It is like a celestial egg, hot yet cool.
<Page83>
　The Tono Shiki of now cannot kill this.
　And there is no need to kill it.
　Because it is perfect, it loses its value with just one scratch.
　A tiny human hand is enough to wake it from its dream.

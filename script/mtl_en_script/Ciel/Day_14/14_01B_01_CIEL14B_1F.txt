　---It's quiet.
　A few minutes have passed since I was alone.
　I pick up my knife and take a few deep breaths.
　I'm preparing for a weak headache and the consequences that will come after this.
<Page2>
　...... I trust my senior Ciel.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page3>
"...... You're right. What a weakness, I am."
　Now you have to look forward, even if only slightly.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page4>
　I decided to head for the stairs.
　There is no way to know what is going on outside in the school building.
　It's a great way to get a feel for what's going on in the city.
<Page5>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it. ......
<Page6>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with your family.
　Even so, it's the only possibility I have left.
<Page7>
"You have that power."
　There was a man who told me that there was some meaning to it, and that there would come a time when I would need this power.
<Page8>
"...... Oh, right. Then now is the time.
　Surely this was my role in all of this, doctor."
<Page9>
　...... Swallow your fears and be prepared.
　This knife is for that purpose.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for and what you can do to help.
<Page10>
　I step out onto the rooftop.
　The noise from the city has died down.
　The wind has stopped and the world is completely silent.
<Page11>
　The building, deprived of its decoration and reduced to nothing but its shape, looks like a tombstone.
　There is no change in the office area ...... where the central park is located, about a kilometer away from the school.
<Page12>
".................."
　Had the battle not yet begun, or was it already over?
　In the middle of the night, the vampire's eyesight has increased many times over.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what's going on in your life.
<Page13>
"I'm sorry.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do. The first shot is a head shot to create an opening.

<Page15>
"But it's an even match, not a defeat. ......
　And so the battle between the two shifted to a white-knuckle battle.
　The senior uses his rifle and pile-driver to the fullest, stifling the Alcade as it strolls through the city.
<Page16>
　I'm not sure what to make of that. ...... It's less than a minute in real time.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.

<Page19>
　A blood-curdling, bone-crushing second follows.
　The assault rifle that is swept, the magic formula that is deployed at the same time, and the bellows sword that is prepared to strike each other.
　All of them.
<Page20>
　That guy, just by waving one arm, is canceled out.
<Page21>
"That disappointment is wrong. This is an emotional scene.
　To let the current princess wield an arm is too much to admire."
<Page22>
"------"
　The sudden voice stops me from thinking.
　There is no one else around.
　There is no clamor or noise in the simplified city.
　I don't need to think about what this voice is in the first place.
　If it's a signal that runs only in my brain.
　It's none other than his consciousness.
<Page23>
　The problem is that now it's a definite word.
　...... Or is it?
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page24>
　It is not the time to be dealing with this kind of guy.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at our own web site.
<Page25>
"It's wonderful. Can such a miracle happen?"
<Page26>
"What's so wonderful about ......!
　Shut your mouth, you know what ...... you know about your seniors!"
<Page27>
　I yell at my own clouded imagination.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　But the guy returned a serious emotion towards such me.
<Page28>
"You're the one who doesn't grasp the situation.
　You can look at that space."
<Page29>
"...... Sora?"
　Prompted by a voice of my own that wasn't mine, I looked up at the dark sky.
"---What the hell is that?"
　Fifty kilometers up in the sky, a shining wheel in the stratosphere.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.

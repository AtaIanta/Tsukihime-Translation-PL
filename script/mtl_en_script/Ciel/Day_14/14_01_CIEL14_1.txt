　Even now, I keep these feelings.
　A record of a time when I had no use for it, no empathy for it.
　A record of what I was before I threw myself into the infinite passage.
　The demise of what was me.
<Page2>
　Has your purpose changed?
　No, the destination itself has not changed.
　I aim for eternity.
　I tried to aim for eternity without any reward.
　How pure and untainted was that intention?
<Page3>
　I have changed.
　I have changed.
　The definition of eternity, and the way to prove it, has changed.
　I wanted to go through a long time and see completion.
　Now I'm asking for a long time to get completion.
<Page4>
　I understand the hollowness of it, but I can't change my mind.
　That woman.
　It's because of that woman.
　Because of her......I lost the purity I once had.
<Page5>
　Humans don't have the strength to live a thousand years.
　Physically and mentally, the human vessel cannot withstand the wear and tear.
　As a bloodsucker, you may have an immortal body, but you can't stop your spirit from slowing down.
　Of course, it is possible to prevent the aging of the mind. But that means stopping. Unchanging ego. Unchanging ideas. Objectivity left behind by the times. I cannot find value in such immortality.
<Page6>
　I, as a human being who continues to change because I am weak, must continue to exist with my purity intact.
<Page7>
　For what purpose?
　It goes without saying. Because it is meaningless otherwise.
　I'm not here as an observer, but as a participant.
　I must know where humans have reached.
　If I don't, I'll never reach that woman.
<Page8>
　...... After all, I will take the means of reincarnation.
　You can be born again from scratch, become me, and die again.
　If it's in this cycle, I'm sure I can stay pure as me.
<Page9>
　I am not attached to the perpetuation as an individual.
　I keep drifting to the perpetuation as a result.
　It was the last resistance to myself who had changed the path.
　It was also a last stand against myself for having changed my path.
<Page10>
　.......
　While the theory remains pure.
　I have no trace of my own purity.
<Page11>
　My quest to know eternity was lost for the umpteenth time.
　I, like all the other mortals, am tempted to prove eternity for myself.
　I don't know what kind of wear and tear that will bring.
<Page12>
　But it is the first time I have known hatred.
　This disappointment and this impurity are all feelings that could not have happened if it were not for that woman.
<Page13>
"...... that ...... woman ......?"
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page14>
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
　I woke up with the words like a heavy stone that can never be moved.
<Page15>
　Zun.
　When I woke up, the date had already changed.
　It was midnight. I've been sleeping like a fossil for over 12 hours.
<Page16>
"...... now, the voice..."
　I don't remember hearing that voice.
　I don't remember the scenery.
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can contact us at our own web site.
　I'm not sure what to say.
<Page17>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I've been hit in the head with a blunt object for a while now.
　It reminded me of a hammer that crushes the shell of a crab. I'm not sure what to make of it.#Zun.#In order to eat well, the figure wielding a blunt instrument with a smile makes you realize that humans are the wealthiest predators on earth.#Zuzun.
<Page18>
"...... Wait, wait, wait. You will die. That's as good as it gets."
　This pain will kill me before it takes over.
<Page19>
　What the hell is wrong with you?
　I know you need my body. You need to be me to make sense of this. You know you'll fall in with me if you mangle my skull before we switch.
　You'll be able to find a lot more than just a few of them.
<Page20>
"Fuck!"
　The impact of the blow to the head caused him to fall to the floor.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　The impact was not directed from the outside to the inside.
　I'm sure you'll agree.
<Page21>
"Ugh, bo.....................!"
　The whole body convulsed.
　The signal from the brain, the nerve transmission error.
　I vomited as I fell, and after vomiting what was in my stomach, I vomited red blood and coughed.
<Page22>
"Ah---, ah......!"
　Stop, stop, stop.
　If it goes on any longer than this, it will crack.
　It's a good thing that you're a good person.
<Page23>
"----!"
　The body jumps with a start.
　It's like a dog with electrodes stuck in its brain.
<Page24>
　I'm not sure what to make of it. The top half of the head feels like it has been left out in the open.
　Still.
<Page25>
"The--"
　Still, the headache didn't go away.
"Ha-, g-, y-, y-, y-, y-, ！！！！."
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page26>
　It is fortunate that it is made of glass. It's the table that broke first. If it was made of wood, it might have been broken as well. After all, what I just used as a hammer is the hardest calcium in the human body. If you want to break it, you have to use a saw or a laser scalpel.
<Page27>
　Blood is flowing from my forehead.
　Of course, it doesn't hurt at all.
　You can find a lot more than that, but the blunt instrument that is swung down without asking is much more...
<Page28>
"-------," he said.
　I can't stand it.
　You will be able to find a lot more than just a few.
　How many seconds. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
<Page29>
"Ta-suke.
　It hurts. In order to do something about it, I tried to stab my palm with a knife. It's no good. It doesn't hurt at all. I see. It's probably just a line. Glasses. If I put on my glasses, this kind of abnormality will stop, like it always does.
"I'm wearing... I'm wearing ....... I'm wearing...!
<Page30>
　No, no, no. Don't laugh. If you laugh, you'll lose your grip. But I can't help wanting to laugh. Because there's nothing I can do about it.
<Page31>
"-------"
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea. I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page32>
　There are more than six hours left until the dawn.
　That fact alone was enough to make me feel like I was going crazy.
<Page33>
"It's ------ ah.
　I've already exceeded my limit.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page34>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　With your own hands.
　With your own hands...
<Page35>
"-------"
　The means of solution is clear.
　There's only one cause. I've never had pain like this before.
　It's not unusual for the Tono Shiki room.
<Page36>
　So it is this room that is abnormal for me.
　When I'm in this room, I get a headache.
　Outside.
　If you don't go outside, you'll go crazy.
<Page37>
"Da ----."
　I was warned not to go out of this room.
　I know.
　Whether this headache is a trap or not, if I go outside, there will be no escape for me.
<Page38>
　But for now, I still have a way out.
　If I get out of this room, I can escape for a few hours.
　If I stay in this room, my brain will die before those few hours.
<Page39>
"I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you.
　My feet wobbled as I made my way to the front door.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　You will find a lot of things to consider when you are looking for a new home.
　And yet, suddenly.
　For no reason at all, I wanted to see the golden moon.

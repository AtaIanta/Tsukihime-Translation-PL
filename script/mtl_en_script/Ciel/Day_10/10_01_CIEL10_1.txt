　It is seeing a dream.
　Vague, especially meaningless.
　I'm looking at a dream like burned candy.
<Page2>
　I'm not sure if I want that woman.
　I don't ...... know.
　You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　But no matter how stirred up the story is, it is an undeniable fact that I have feelings for her.
<Page3>
　I'm not sure if I like that woman.
　I ...... don't know anymore now.
　I want to see her right away, and I want to hear her story right away.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　Even though he's important to me.
　I was afraid to think about what I am to him.
<Page4>
　After the meeting at the apartment.
　I realized what kind of person I was.
　There is no room for extenuation.
　If vampires are man-eating monsters, then these two eyes are evil that should not exist.
　I was born by mistake, and I should have gone out in the rain that night.
<Page5>
　But there was someone who told me I could make amends.
　I'm not sure what to do with it, but I'm sure it'll be fine.
<Page6>
　...... so I don't know now.
　I just wanted to see the smile on your face, but why---?
　I didn't want to see that face.
　I don't know why I let that man make the face I most wanted to see ......?
<Page7>
"Shiki-sama."
　...... In the morning light, I can hear Jade calling out.
<Page8>
"It's time for you to wake up, Shiki-sama.
　Please take care of yourself."
<Page9>
　It's a great way to get a feel for what's going on in your life. ......
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to take advantage of the fact that you'll be able to get a great deal more.
<Page10>
"------"
　...... I wonder if it's the effects of last night's exhaustion.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page11>
"Good morning Jade. Thank you again this morning. I think the time is ...... a little too spare. I'll get dressed and go to the cafeteria right away."
<Page12>
　I got out of bed in my pajamas.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
<Page13>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to make of it.
"Hmm?　Yes, I do. I have a slight headache, so I forgot.
"......, Mr. Shiki. Are you feeling unwell this morning?
<Page14>
"No, the headache will go away soon. The headache will pass soon. It's just that I've been thinking a lot and not sleeping well.
".................."

"It's not going to go away any time soon,......."
　It's like having your head stuck in a cutting machine.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page20>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I can't even afford to stand up.
　I put my upper body down on the bed and hold my head down with both hands to endure the pain.
<Page21>
　The pain doesn't go away.
　It's always been something that comes from within. You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
<Page22>
　It's ...... but this morning's is particularly bad.
　It's like having a five-inch nail driven into your head. It's the kind of pain that penetrates the brain stem and makes you forget what you were thinking earlier.
<Page23>
　In retrospect, Tono Shiki has been dealing with this kind of body for the past seven years since the accident.
　Dizziness that comes suddenly. Headaches. Anemia.
　I can't count how many things I've had to give up because of it.
<Page24>
　The doctor said that I had miraculously survived. They said I should be grateful enough for that.
　Did they want to say that it was a miracle that I was alive like this, so I should put up with some pain?
<Page25>
　The eye that sees death close at hand.
　It is a miracle that we are still alive.
<Page26>
　...... That.
　I think he meant that human life is not precious, but it is something that will not return, so cherish it.
<Page27>
　In the last few days, I've seen a lot of people die.
　It was so quick. Life is so quick that you can't help but laugh. People who were sacrificed just because of luck or not.
　There is no barrier between the living and the dead. No one is protected by a wall that refuses death. Our survival is not guaranteed in any way.
　Life is something that ends independently of the will of the individual.
　It's a good thing that you're not the only one who thinks that life is precious, because you don't understand the nature of life itself.
<Page28>
　............ Oh, my.
　I... I... You...
　I'm not sure how long
　　　　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page29>
"......
　The headache finally subsided.
　It's a good idea to take a big deep breath to regain your composure.
　It's a good idea to take in some fresh air in the morning to wash away the bad feelings.
<Page30>
"It's a good idea.
　It's times like this that I need to stay calm.
　I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

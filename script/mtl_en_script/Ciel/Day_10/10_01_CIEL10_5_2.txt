　Let's follow the instructions of ...... the senior.
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you're going to need to be able to pay for it.
The vampire's bed is lined with traps for intruders.
　According to that theory, if I, an amateur, stepped in, I would only be dragging my senior down with me.
<Page2>
"...... I understand. Can I wait here?"
"Of course. But if he doesn't come back after an hour, please go out to the city.
　Do you remember the restaurant where we had dinner before?　Let's meet up there."
　The senior didn't wait for my reply and ran out of the tea room.
<Page3>
　.......
　.............
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　You can find a lot more information on the web.
　This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page4>
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's not a problem.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page5>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's ...... dangerous, but it's also not a problem.
　The sun is still rising. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page6>
　So what if...
　If. If there's something in the basement where they say loa's coffin is.
　In the basement where they say loa's coffin is, what if they find something we're not supposed to see?
<Page7>
"....... What's the proof?"
　I smile wryly at my unintelligible thoughts.
　Anyway, let's leave the tea room.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website and see if you can find anything of interest.
<Page8>
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website and see if you can find anything you like.
"Senpai?"
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.
"What?"
　The door is still closed. I'm not sure what to do.
"It was a sound from the classroom next door. ......
<Page9>
"The ground shook.
<Page10>
　The ground shook.
　It's a very big earthquake.
　It's as if the world has been destroyed.
<Page11>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　...... It's still not true.
<Page12>
　It's a great way to get the most out of your time with your family and friends. ...... Quietly, you can hear the thirsty voice of the person who speaks it, ripping his or her throat out little by little.
　It belonged to a woman he knew.
"----, ---- --?"
　I noticed that my own voice, like that, was also being silenced.
<Page13>
　Your mouth is being forced to suck on something.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page14>
　I'm not sure what to say.
　A gasping breath is leaking from my own mouth.
　But I don't feel bad at all.
　If anything, you can't feel anything at all, there is no sensation.
<Page15>
I'm not sure what you mean by "......".
　Are you stupid?　You're not an idiot?　You're not stupid?
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not. It's not a charity."
<Page16>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　You can be hypocritical and hobbyist when it comes to charity.
<Page17>
　Hahahahahahahaha.
　It's not hard to see why, but the lungs drive the throat to take in oxygen.
　But there is no feeling in the throat.
　I don't think it's working properly.
　The most important thing is.
<Page18>
"I'm sure you're right, right, Shiki?
　I'm not sure what to do. It's not a bad idea to have some fun with it, right?"
　---This situation.
　I think it's already too late for that.
<Page19>
"---, ---......！！！！
　I raise my voice. No words come out.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's not my breath that is echoing in the tea room, it's only the woman's agitated breathing.
<Page20>
"''Ah, are you calling for Ciel-san?
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
　And you...
<Page21>
"Now, you lost the last thing you had left."
　---What did you lose?
　I don't know anything because I don't feel anything.
　I'm not sure if that was a mercy on the part of the woman.
　I don't know if it was a mercy of the woman or to enjoy the face of the bewildered prey.
<Page22>
　What I do know is.
　I don't have the feeling in my limbs.
　I'm already
　I don't have the ■■ itself anymore.
<Page23>
"You are a day late to talk about Roa's coffin, aren't you?
　If Ciel had found it before I did, the trial might have been a little better.
<Page24>
"----, ----, ----. ----"
　...... My vision is getting fuzzy.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　The only thing that comes down is the woman's erratic breathing, which is mocking, apologetic, and inexplicable.
<Page25>
"'I'm using a normal weapon on you, so there's no pain, right?　It's just weird, right?
　Hey, where do you want me to cut?　Shoulder?　Back?　Your stomach?　Your butt?　I'll listen to anything you ask.
　Oh, but you can't remove the gag. You'll be able to get a lot more than just a pair of shoes.
<Page26>
"---- ......... ..."
　But it will never happen.
　The woman will not kill me.
　It's not easy to kill.
　...... You're out of your mind.
　In this situation, I understand this broken woman.
<Page27>
"---, ............
"You're crying, you're crying, you're crying.
　It's okay, the night is just beginning. Let's have a lot of fun.
　It doesn't matter how much you cry or how much you leak.
　Because in the end..."
<Page28>
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.
　While it is large enough to fit in both of the woman's hands.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your day.
"I'm going to go into this crying and screaming.
　Familiar, square.

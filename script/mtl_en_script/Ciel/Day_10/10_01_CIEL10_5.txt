　Oh, I found myself admitting quietly.

"Tono-kun, that's not true.
　I'm not brave. I just don't have a fear of death. Because I'm not going to die. Even back then, I didn't have a shred of fear."
<Page62>
"'...... I'm just being blunt, that's all.
　A person with real courage is someone who can fight even though they are scared to death.
　I don't have that courage. Because I don't die.

"It's this mentality that makes me unusual. When it comes to fear of death, I'm more of a monster than a vampire.

　...... A long time ago, I committed a sin that led me to this body.
　I made a lot of mistakes and left a lot of lives in the lurch.
　Afterwards, the punishment imposed on me was as much as the number of people I sacrificed."
<Page69>
"'...... I was forgiven my sins for enduring it, and was chosen to act on my behalf. "I was even praised by the priest for my patience, saying that it was comparable to that of a saint.
　But that's not true. I am not strong at all.
　I was only able to endure the punishment because I had a body that could not die and because I was strong. If I had a normal body, I would have given up in a day.

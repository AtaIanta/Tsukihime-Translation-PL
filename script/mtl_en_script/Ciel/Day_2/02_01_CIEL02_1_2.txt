　You can find a lot of people who are looking for a new way of life.
　The financial situation from now on will be severe.
　The head of our family has no sense of fun, so we can't hope for any extra income. Sadly, there is no hope in that area.
<Page2>
　Therefore, we want to keep our expenses as low as possible. It would be too shameful to be penniless in case of emergency.
<Page3>
　I went to the purchasing department and bought some affordable bread and a pack of tea.
　It was more crowded than usual because of the new products they had brought in, so it took a while. The bento group had already finished their lunch and were chatting.
<Page4>
"Tono-kun, are you going to have lunch now?
"Yes. I'm not sure if I'd be able to do that. What about you, Yumizuka-san?
<Page5>
"I've already done that.
　I've already finished, and there's a little leftover side dish. ...... How about a side dish for lunch?
<Page6>

　He clasped his hands together and thanked Yumizuka.
<Page8>
"I'm sure you're right, only bread is lonely!
　Yes, this!　I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.
<Page9>
　It was a strange combination.
　The fried tofu was made by my mom, but the tsukudani was apparently made by Yumizuka. For the sake of her honor, I'll comment that the taste was ordinary.
　Anyway, I think it made for a spectacular lunch.
<Page10>
"Thanks for the food, it was delicious.
　If there is a next opportunity, I will return the favor next time.
"No, it's okay, today was just a fluke!
　I'm not sure what to say.　Did you hear about Tohyama-sensei's talk?
<Page11>
"What do you mean by Tohyama's story, the one from yesterday?
　The rumor about him being unhappy or something?
<Page12>
"Yeah!　You know, that was a mistake!
　He was involved in a car accident and broke his leg, so he had to be hospitalized.
<Page13>
"Well, that's good. Oh, no, that's not good.
　If you're hospitalized because of a leg injury, it means you can't walk, right? Tohyama's going to be pissed at me for messing with him.
<Page14>

　But I understand how she feels.

".................."
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　I've heard some good news, and without the annoying Arihiko, I think I can spend the afternoon in peace.
"..................
　By the way.
　Why doesn't she go back to her desk?
<Page21>
"Yumizuka-san, it's almost fifth period.
"What?　Oh, yeah, I know, one minute, one minute to chime!
<Page22>
"Ah. Everyone will probably go back to their seats after the bell rings, so there's still time.
"No, I don't know, I don't have much time, but I think now is the time to take a chance without you, you know?
"What?"
<Page23>
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it. And then.
<Page24>
"Well, you know!
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page25>
　It's a great way to get the most out of your time with your family. This is ...... the point card of the family restaurant ......?
<Page26>
"I'm not sure what to do. But is it okay?
"I've got a lot of points!
　Well, my friend was in a pinch, so I applied for a part-time job and the manager gave me a bunch of cards!　Come eat with us when you feel like it!　At 7pm or something like that!"
　Yumizuka ran to his seat as if he were rolling.
<Page27>
　I'm not sure what to do.
"..................."
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.

"I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I didn't even ask for this kind of life advice.
<Page29>
"............. Why are you talking about that now?
"Well, you were approached this morning, weren't you? I'm a little curious. I'm not sure what to say. It's a great way to make sure you don't get caught in the middle.
"What?　What's that? I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page30>
"It's not that, but... I'm not sure what to make of it.

　And what about you? I'm not sure what to do.　I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.
<Page31>
"...... I think that would be difficult.
"I'm not sure. I'm not sure what to do.
"It's not that I don't like it. I'm not sure what to say, but I'll tell you what. If you try to hit on me, I'll do my best to stop you.
<Page32>
"Dad? Then why are you keeping your distance?
"No, that's the thing. ...... I don't know what to say, but when I look at you, I get sad.
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but it's a good idea.
<Page33>
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
　It's a good idea to take a look at your own personal life.
<Page34>
　There is a part of me that unconsciously shuns ...... people with decent values ...... that I can respect in a straightforward way.
　It's not that I don't like it, it's more like I'm afraid to go near it.
<Page35>
"............ muu."
　I have a card that has exactly 1,000 yen worth of points saved up on it.
　The name of the shop is Lindberg. It is a very average family restaurant located at the north exit of Soya Station.

　As soon as I stepped out into the hallway, I ran into a senior student with a familiar face.
<Page2>
"I'm not sure what's going on here.
　Do you have something to do in the second year classroom?
<Page3>
"'Yes, of course. It's not exactly the second year's classroom, but a certain person in the second year.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page4>
"In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to buy a lot of things.
　I can't eat it all by myself, so I've come to get someone to talk to who seems to be free.

<Page7>
"You can't come to the second year classrooms, you're a senior. If you want to invite them, please invite your third year classmates. You'll have a better conversation that way.
<Page8>
"That's true, but I'm in the mood to talk with a younger boy today. I just feel like it, so please don't ask me why.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page9>
"I'm sure you'll agree. I'm not sure what to say.

<Page10>
"I've got you then. It's a good idea to have a good time.

<Page11>
"------"
　You can find a lot more information on the web.
　It is really a trivial gesture, but it is filled with a mysterious compulsion that you can't help but resist.
<Page12>
　I go out to the courtyard.
　It's deepening into autumn, and even though it's sunny, the temperature is chilly.
　The students who take lunch in the courtyard are those who love the elegance of the place, and the seniors seem to be one of them.
<Page13>
"The benches are unusually empty today.
　I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.
<Page14>

"I'm sure you'll agree.　It's been a week of advising the purchasing department's stocking route!　At last!　We've finally managed to sell a full-fledged bakery product!"
<Page18>
　It was an oval-shaped, chunky loaf of bread that spilled slightly from the palm of his hand.
　They were fried breads with a dark brown surface that glistened with oil.
　All four were the same size and design.
　It was a freshly fried curry bun, no matter where you looked.
<Page19>
"It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with your family.
　I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one.
<Page20>
"...... No, um... Senpai, here.
　It's the curry bread sold at the famous bakery in front of the station, right?
<Page21>
"Hoy?
　It's not "hoi polloi".
　I'm not sure what to make of it. I don't like it when people look at me like that.
<Page22>
"You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
　I'm not sure. I avoided using specific words.

<Page26>
　I picked up one of the curry breads spread out on the senior's lap and carried it to my mouth.
<Page27>
"I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results. ...... Mmmmmmm. In the event that you have any kind of questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site. I'm not sure what to make of it.

"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.　Curry and fried bread can be hard on the stomach. It might be hard for a girl.
"I'm sure you're right.

　Oh, more importantly, tea, right? Is it okay to use barley tea, Tono-kun?
<Page32>
"Yes, Japanese people should have barley tea!
　I got some leftover curry bread!
"What?"
<Page33>
　It's not surprising that the seniors were surprised.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page34>
"It's really good. It's so good. I can taste the curry more than anything. It's too much of a treat for me when I just woke up on an empty stomach!
　It's a little bit hard on the stomach, but the senior's sincerity makes it even!
<Page35>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page36>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.　I'm not sure if it's a curse from a previous life?　Or are you just that kind of creature?"

<Page39>

<Page44>
"In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.

　Well, I'll give him a special pass this time, since he has twice expressed his very brilliant opinion.
　He shrugged his shoulders and said something like a senior student.
<Page49>
"I'm not sure what to do.　I bought you an admission ticket!
"Oh.
"Gee.
　Arihiko came back in about five minutes.
　In his hands, he is carrying two paper bags that are swollen to the brim.
<Page50>
"Oh, my God, this is too much. ......
"What do you think? I tried to buy up as much as I could. ---It's a good idea to have a good idea of what's going on in your life.

<Page53>
"If you can't finish it, leave it. If you can't finish it, leave it behind.
　That's why, yes, senpai.
　I apologize for what I said earlier, and I'll share my lunch with you under the sleeve.
<Page54>
"Thank you very much for your kindness.
　I'm not sure what to do. I'll just stand there.
"What are you talking about?#Please sit down, senior.
　So, what did you guys talk about while I was gone?
　Going out after school?
<Page55>
"On the contrary, in school.
　You weren't there this morning, so you don't even know that a new teacher came in to replace Tohyama.#What a waste. She's so beautiful that the guys in our class are so excited about her.
<Page56>
"That's a new one. The new teacher is like a transfer student?
　What type is she?　I don't really like overbearing female teachers.
"It's like she was a trainee until last year, and she's a soothing type.#You like older men who are patient, don't you?　Good for you. You're 25, just like you like.
<Page57>
"No, no, no, no, not 25, not 25!　You're the same age as my sister. That's the only thing I can't physiologically accept!
<Page58>
"Oh. Inui-kun, do you prefer older women?
"That's right. Older women are not troublesome.
Oh, no, if she's cute, she can be annoying, so she can be one year younger than me.
<Page59>
"Mm-hmm. You are good at both pampering and biting.
　By the way, what about Tono-kun?　I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page60>
"I've never been particularly conscious of it, but I don't think I'm as free as Arihiko.
"Oh, no. Wait a minute. It's so annoying. I'm not sure why, but Tono smells like a sissy killer. Isn't there no shortage of stories about tutors and doctor's daughters and that sort of thing?
<Page61>
"Shut up. Just shut up. I've never hired a private tutor in the first place.
<Page62>
"Okay.#So you have a daughter who's your doctor?
"I'm not sure what to do.
　Ciel, please don't fall for Arihiko's gossip!
<Page63>
"It's not a yogurt story, though. I'm not sure what to do. In fact, you ran off and had lunch with an older colleague, didn't you?
<Page64>
"That's right. This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your money. I felt like a rabbit in a snowfield.
"Well, it's actually a cold-blooded creature wearing a rabbit's skin, isn't it? It's like a spider or a scorpion or one of those mechanical creatures.
<Page65>
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　I would like to raise an objection, but I'm afraid it would be a snake, so I keep my mouth shut.
　And the curry bread is steadily decreasing.
　I described it earlier as croquettes served on a plate, but I want to correct that. The mountain of fried bread is now being consumed like a snack.
　There are less than 20 minutes left until the lunch break ends.
　What will be the fate of the curry buns?
<Page66>
　The chit-chat continued until the end of the lunch break.
　Arihiko and I would talk about stupid things, and then Ciel would interject his opinion, and then the conversation would start all over again. We ran out of curry bread.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page67>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing. It's also a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with your family. ...... No, wait.
I don't think I ate anything, I don't think I could have eaten ......
I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
<Page68>
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your vacation.
<Page69>
"I'm not sure what to say. I know I should be cautious, but strangely enough, I'm lenient with Inui. This is also a human virtue?
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
<Page70>
"I'm not sure what to make of it. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. I think they trust him and let him go.
<Page71>
"I see. It's true that I feel that way.
　You have known Inui-kun for a long time, so you know him well.
<Page72>
"It's just a rotten relationship. You can easily tell that he is a senior.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page73>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what you mean by that.

　I went out into the hallway and headed for the stairs anyway.
　Whether you are going to the cafeteria or purchasing, you need to get down to the ground floor no matter what.

　It is unusual for a teacher to be in the hallway during lunchtime.
　At our school, teachers usually have lunch in the staff room, the preparation room, or the teacher's space in the cafeteria.
　There is no reason for them to spend time on the second floor stair landing.
　Could it be ......

"Sir. Is it possible that you are lost?"
　I'm sure that's not the case, but just in case, I called out to him.
<Page5>
"You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　It's just a change of pace, a little relaxation.

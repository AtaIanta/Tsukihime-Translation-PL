"I'm sure you'll agree.　I'm back, Jade.
"''Welcome back, Shiki-sama.''

<Page10>
"I see. Well then, see you in half an hour.
　You have been waiting for me outside for a long time, so you should also rest a little, Jade. That's my command as your master.
<Page11>
"''Then I'll take your word for it and excuse myself. I will pick you up later, please take a good night's rest."

　I'm not sure why you're here. You've already defeated Vroob, so you don't need me anymore, right?
<Page27>
"No. I feel good, so I'm here to suck your blood.
"You...
　What's he talking about, coming here for blood? ......?

<Page34>
"Oh. I'm not sure if you're interested in the other half of the story, the serious one?

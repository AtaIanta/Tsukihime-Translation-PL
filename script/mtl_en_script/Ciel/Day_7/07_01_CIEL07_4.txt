"The first one is preferred over the second for Darjeeling.　The taste and aroma is more subdued and doesn't linger.
<Page4>
"Well, I think the first flush is more suitable for you, brother. I prefer the second flush, but sometimes I'll go with him.

"But if it's a matter of taste, Japanese tea is better than black tea, don't you think?　I think my brother and Amber like Japanese tea, while Jade and I are tea drinkers.

<Page12>
"Of course you're right. But isn't eight o'clock too early for you?　We're not children, let's change the time to ten o'clock.
<Page13>

"Mm."
<Page14>
　I'm not sure what to say.
　In the event that you're a free spirit like me and you don't come home, the reason is nothing more than a game.
<Page15>
"But it's not just a matter of obeying the curfew. I'm glad that he reflected on his past self-degradation and came home early, but I'm worried about what happened after that. You seem to have been absent-minded since dinner, did something happen?
　For example, do you have any plans after this?"

"I'm not sure what you mean.　I'm not particularly concerned about ...... the river that runs through the garden. ...... What about Amber?
<Page23>
"I don't have any malfunctions that I'm concerned about at the moment either. ...... Oh, I think you might be talking about the old underground channel.
　It hasn't been maintained in years, and on days when it rains hard, there's a chance of bad water accumulating.
<Page24>
　He said .......
　I wonder if Alcade was referring to that waterway ......?
<Page25>

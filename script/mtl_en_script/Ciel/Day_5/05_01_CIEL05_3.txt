　When you wake up from the suffocation and heat.
　It was all darkness.

"....... ...... What the hell is this place ......?"
　Anyway, it was cramped.
　I'm frozen in a push-up position.
　I can't extend my legs. You can't even move your hands that are sticking out below you.
　The back also hurts. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page3>
"I'm sure you've noticed.　I'm sorry. I could have stayed like this for a while longer.
"Dr. Noel, ......!"

<Page7>
　I grasped the situation after being told.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'm sure it's a good idea. ...... I should have died there.
　But the fact that I'm still alive ......
<Page8>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
"Of course. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're getting into.
<Page9>
　Dr. Noel says with pride.
　It's a good idea to have a teacher in your life.
　It was three days ago that she was assigned to the school. So you came ...... to this city to kill Vrouve from the beginning?
<Page10>
"...... But why at our school?　You don't need a teacher.
"I'm not sure what to make of that.　Well, it's more convenient for them to blend in with the city life.
<Page11>
"Exactly. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　...... Then what about Ciel?
"I'm sorry.
　I'm not sure what you mean by that. I'm not sure what to do. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.

"The objective is to eradicate the vampires."
"Once this mission is over, we will head to the next mission destination---"
　Despite this situation, I am distracted by those words.
<Page16>
"Shiki-kun?　What's wrong, are you out of oxygen?　Then, shall I give you the air in your lungs, sensei?"
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's not the time for that.
<Page17>

"...... that. So, do you know what happened?"
"'What do you mean, the square collapsed and everyone was buried alive?
　The dead may have been crushed, but the dead don't die from that,......, so they're probably asleep by now. They'll be fine at night."
"Vrove is not dead ...... then what about the senior?"
<Page22>
"That girl?　I'm sure he's a lot more robust than that. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.　Did you know him?
<Page23>

<Page25>
"It's a good thing you've got a good idea of what you're doing.
　I'm not sure what to make of it. I'll leave the rest to her and stay like this for a while."
<Page26>
"What ...... are you doing ...... for a while?"
<Page27>
"Don't worry, Japanese rescuers are excellent. You can find them if you are patient for two days.　Or will ...... you have to endure half a day in this position?

"No, I mean Vrouve. ......!
　Aren't you worried, doctor!　That monster is going to go out again at night, isn't it?
<Page30>
"Of course. I'm not sure what to do.
　If so, a landslide like this wouldn't be enough to disable it. When the sun goes down, the ground will be at best a screaming mess and at worst icy.
"Then ......!
<Page31>
"Are you telling me you don't have time for this?
　Don't be arrogant. The other party is the twenty-seventh ancestor, a big name that even the church can only ignore.
　They are not even living beings anymore. They are demons that use concepts as weapons. A curse that erodes reality. They are like the breakdown of this world, disrupting the physical laws of humanity that have been stable for 10,000 years."
<Page32>
"Didn't the guy who told you the name of the ancestors also say that?
　The 27th Patriarch is a country. No one individual can defeat a country. Ordinary people can only hide and wait for them to leave.
　Do you understand?　It's not something that we can do anything about, and it's not something that we should even be thinking about.

"Sir, ......!　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　I'm sorry.　I'm sure you're not the only one.
<Page36>
"Of course it's unbuttoned.　I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one who has a problem with this.　It's a win-win.
<Page37>
　Which one?
　I'm not talking about that. It's really bad!

<Page38>

<Page39>
"I'm not sure.　It's almost dusk up there.

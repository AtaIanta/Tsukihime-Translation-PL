　The roar from inside is like the cry of a creature on the verge of death.
<Page2>
　It is ...... the limit.
　You can see how reckless an attempt this was, even from my point of view.
<Page3>
"Dr. Noel!"
"I'm not sure what to say.　I'm not sure what to say.
　No, no, no, go back upstairs!　I've been told by Ciel-san to turn away any outsiders who come in!
<Page4>
"I can't go back now!
　What's going on here?
<Page5>
"As you can see!　You see, I sealed off the entire land to Vrouve, but it didn't work at all!
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　She said she could handle it on her own... and when she came out, she compressed the cathedral to this size and jumped inside!　That was an hour ago!"
<Page6>
"---!"
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　In the event that you're not sure what you're looking for, you'll be able to find a lot more information on the web.
<Page7>
　If that cube-shaped thing disappears, it is understandable that the blizzard we saw underground will cover the city. I'm not sure what to do.
<Page8>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.
<Page9>
"I'm sure there is!　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page10>
"I'm not going to be able to get out of here without defeating Vroob?
<Page11>
"Yes, yes!　But I can't!　No, no, no, no!　No matter how much she wants to fight off the twenty-seventh ancestor, it's absolutely impossible!　It's a miracle that she can take on that curse by herself!
<Page12>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page13>
"Damn ......!"
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page14>
　In the event that you have any kind of questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　A box where time and space are distorted.
　In it, the senior is fighting that monster alone.
<Page15>
"...... is winning. The senior is not defeated, but ......!
　She was brave and strong.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't fall behind.
　But that blizzard disgraced the senior. It is abnormal to live and work in that environment.
<Page16>
　If you are in a ...... decent state.
　If I hadn't made this box, and hadn't worried about the cold wave spreading, and had fought on my own, I would never have lost,......!
<Page17>
"............!"
　I'm going to grind my back teeth in frustration.
　The situation is too harsh.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page18>
　Take off your glasses. Look at the enemy per boundary.
　If I can't kill Vrove on my own, I can at least be that person's weapon,......!
<Page19>
"Ouch,......!"
　The fingertips that unconsciously extended to the wall freeze in an instant.
　I'm not sure what to make of it. ...... No. I'm not sure what to do.
<Page20>
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
　In the extreme cold, humans are unable to operate satisfactorily. Blood freezes. Cells necrotic. Most importantly, the brain dies. Humans are too weak to face the vampires.
<Page21>
"......!"
　And now it was too late for anything else.
<Page22>
　The shadows in the blizzard overlap.
　Towards the girl in armor whose movement has slowed down.
　A spear with all its strength is released.
　Like a crucified sinner.
　The shadow that looks like a senior is slammed into the wall of the world.
<Page23>
　---The end of the senior is the end of the ward.
"Ta-da, evacuate, evacuate!　Ah, but it won't be in time from now!　I'll get iced too!
　---With her collapse, the cathedral was shattered.
<Page24>
　---The world freezes.
　---A cold wave with a wind speed of 160 kilometers freezes everything.
　---In the midst of it all, I see my senpai bouncing around like trash.
　---I could only watch it from the sidelines.
<Page25>
"...... No, no ......!
　Nothing is over yet.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　But it is warm. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page26>
　I open my eyes and look up at the sky.
　The cold wave hasn't reached the city.
　The blowing cold air is confined to this crater.
<Page27>
　And on top of a building far above, there was the figure of Alcade, raising his hand with a look of heartfelt disgust on his face.
<Page28>
"That guy ......!"
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　My body temperature is just below zero. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family. ......

　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page30>
"You can go to ......!
　The rest is up to us.
　I'm going to help you. I'm not sure what to make of it.
　In this situation, I intuit that the two are synonymous.
　I'm going to...
C:>Look at Ciel senior.
C:>I look at Vrouve.

　...... awkward.
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but it's a good idea.
<Page2>
"That ...... senior, this is...
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm applying for a city control war, will it pass?"
<Page3>
"''Hmm, it will pass, but isn't it pointless?　There is no stock of substitutes in this area.
You can get permission, but the increase in strength is hopeless. If we do it, it will be just us."
<Page4>
"...... Oh, I see. So, please declare press restrictions and checks on the police force. You have that many contacts, don't you, doctor?
<Page5>
"It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　I'm not sure what to do.　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page6>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time and money.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page7>
"------"
　In the meantime, the older man kept his mouth shut, dusting off his uniform without a care in the world.
<Page8>
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time with your family.
　I think I have the right to question who this person is.
<Page9>
".................."
　...... But I didn't know what to say.
<Page10>
　Like, "Who are you, senior?
　What are you going to do now?
　What are you going to do now?
　What are you going to do?
　I can't speak such common words.
<Page11>
　If you look at the sky, the dusk is almost over.
　There are only a few hours left until sunset.
　Calculating backwards from the department stores around us, this sunken section was the area where Central Park used to be.
<Page12>
　A crater filled with rubble. Who would believe that there was a hall like that under the park?
<Page13>
　There was already a barricade-like structure on the ground looking up from here.
　Even though there was a cave-in, there were no onlookers in sight. It was such a huge disaster. There should have been at least one or two news helicopters in the air, but there were none.
<Page14>
There are no news reports," he said. This is just an accident. There is also an evacuation of nearby residents because of a gas explosion that has built up underground.
　The only people who are prepared for what's going to happen after ...... this are me, the police who have cordoned off the area, and you."
<Page15>
"...... I see. What about that underground passage?#Yeah.
"It was destroyed in the collapse. They'll find traces of it, but they'll probably pretend it never happened.
"...... Is that what they're going to do to you?
<Page16>
"No, sir. It is only the decision of the police in this country. They'll investigate the fact that there was an underground cavity here. But that's the end of it. Because it doesn't make sense that there is a monster that collects corpses and drains their blood.
　What looks like the bodies of dozens of missing people have been found here, and that's it."
<Page17>
　I just replied to the senior's explanation, "I see.
　I knew that this was not a case that would be handled by the proper judiciary, but I couldn't let it go.
<Page18>
　So many dead.
　All those victims will be buried in the dark without any understanding of why they were killed.
<Page19>
"...... At any rate, I have to say thank you.
　Thank you, senior. If it weren't for you, I would have been one of them."
<Page20>
"......Hey, well.
　It's a good thing that Tono-kun is safe, though.
<Page21>
"But that's not the point!
　This is not the time for idle chitchat.
<Page22>
"I'll be frank with you. You're an ordinary person, and it's not good for you to be involved in this anymore. I expect you to use your wise judgment and remain silent.
　...... is not something you can forget.
　So, for your safety, I am erasing your memory for the past day. Just don't resist."
<Page23>
"......?"
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with us.
<Page24>
"This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page25>
"I'm sure you'll agree. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page26>
　The senior comes closer and closer to you.
"I'm not sure what to say.　I'm not sure what to do.　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page27>
"I'm not sure what to say. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page28>
"It's a good idea to close your eyes.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your day.
<Page29>
"Well..."
　It's hard to keep up with all the developments that are taking place.
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page30>
　It's a good idea to take a look at the web site and see if you can find anything you like.
　I've got a few things to do.
<Page31>
　If you can erase the ...... memory, I want you to erase it too.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page32>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.　Then you can do that tomorrow!
　Within today, it's still---"
<Page33>
　I can't pretend that nothing happened.
　After experiencing that catacombs, you can never go back to your daily life alone.
<Page34>
".................. Do you want to do anything dangerous?
"No, no. I don't. I've never done anything like that.
"....................."
<Page35>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page36>
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　For my senior, it was a few seconds.
　After what felt like minutes of silence for me
<Page37>
"...... I understand. I believe in you, Tono-kun.
　In the event that you're not sure what to do, you'll be able to find out how to do it.
<Page38>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page39>
"------
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your investment.
<Page40>
"You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the best results.
　I call out to him.
<Page41>
"What is it?"
"'............ that. Did you come to this city to kill vampires?
<Page42>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not originally from this town. You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life. When all is said and done, I will leave this city.
<Page43>
"At that time, I will erase your memory.
　It's a great way to make sure you don't get caught in the middle of the action.
The next time you're in my sights, I'll treat you as an obstacle, and that's the way it's going to be.
<Page44>
　With a cold-hearted gaze and a cold voice, the senior warned me.
　Go home.
　There is no need to risk your life any longer, he said.
<Page45>
"......I understand. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.　Like fighting that vampire alone.
<Page46>
"I'm not sure. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　In a few days, reinforcements will arrive, and until then, we will just monitor this place. You can rest easy and go back to where you belong."
<Page47>
　With that, she vanished from my sight in an instant.
　The sun will soon set on the horizon.
　The time for vampires...
　The time for battle is almost upon us.
<Page48>
"...... already.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page49>
　I'm not sure what to make of this. ...... She's going to fight on her own.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

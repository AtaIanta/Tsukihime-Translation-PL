"Wait until Alcade's strength is restored."
　I'm not sure if that's a good thing, but it's a good thing.
<Page2>
　I saw to that and went out of the apartment.
　...... Needless to say, the destination to head to.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page3>
　It's a great way to get the most out of your time with your family.
　The department store street is gorgeous with advertisements and products on display. People pass by, looking at the windows.
　In one of the streams, there is a familiar large department store.
<Page4>
　It is one of the biggest department stores in town.
　Many people still come and go, and this department store, which can be called the face of Soya Station, is really ......?
<Page5>
"You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
　There's not a single vampire in sight,.......
<Page6>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your investment.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time and money.

"Come to think of it, ...... Arihiko's guy said there was a strange story at the north entrance ......."
<Page8>
"There is a part-time job that anyone can do and that pays well."
　It's an urban legend with no credibility, a childish lure.
　The reason why it has not fallen into disuse, and yet has not spread flamboyantly, and has continued to live on the Internet forever, is because it is not a total lie?
<Page9>
　There is no one who can testify to the details of that part-time job. It remains unclear whether anyone has actually experienced it.
　And yet, rumors of the part-time job continue to circulate.
　The recipients are unspecified, but the transmissions continue even now.
<Page10>
　......, in other words. Regardless of the truth of the matter, there is someone out there who needs a third party.
<Page11>
　In conclusion, there was nothing unusual about the department store.
　From the foodstuff department in the basement to the specialty shops on the seventh floor above ground, it was a department store without any irregularities.
　It's just that
<Page12>
The only thing was, "...... is missing from the seventh floor up. Considering the size of this department store, it should have at least ten floors, but ......
<Page13>
　The elevator only has a button to the seventh floor, and the stairs have a sign on the seventh floor prohibiting entry.
<Page14>
　In the event that you've got a lot of money, you're going to need to be able to pay for it.
　The staircase continued to the upper floor, but it dead-ended there.
　The part leading to the eighth floor had shutters down as a matter of course.
　Next to it, there is one locked emergency door.
<Page15>
"If there ...... s anything in there, it s either over here or ......
　I ponder whether to go inside or return here.
<Page16>
　I know I'm going to be doing something reckless.
　I'm going to step into the monster's home alone.
　I know how crazy that sounds.
　I've tasted it too many times.
<Page17>
"...... is fine. You can still go."
　I've got a knife in my pocket and I'm clutching it.
　I'm not sure what to do with it.
<Page18>
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business. It's the safest way to go.
　But what will happen with that?　In the first place, I'm going to "kill" you now. If such a murderer runs to the police, who can he convince? It's not like they share the same goal in the first place.
<Page19>
"...... We'll see what happens.
　If things get out of hand, you can go back to that guy's room. ......"
<Page20>
　It's a good idea to take off your glasses and kill the lock on the locked emergency door.
　You'll be able to find a lot more than just a few of them.
　I took a deep breath to calm myself down and slipped into the floor where the lights had gone out.
<Page21>
　Inside the eighth floor, it was all dark.
　It's only natural that the lights are out, but it was still too unexpected.
　It's daytime now. Even if the electricity is not running, the sunlight from the window should be bright.
<Page22>
　However, in reality, it is this. The window that is window is blocked from the inside by something like an iron plate.
　It is too much for the anti-theft measure.
　The iron plate is attached by the bolt, and it is not possible to remove it by human power. The iron plate is attached even to the small window of the rest room.
<Page23>
　A morbid obsession. But the work is messy.
　Because the size of the iron plate does not match the size of the window delicately, sunlight is entering through a small gap.
<Page24>
　You can only think of it as a way to prevent people from escaping from the inside,......, not as a way to prevent people from entering from the outside.
<Page25>
　It's a good idea to have a little bit of sunshine in your home.
　Even if it is,......
<Page26>
"Isn't this ...... too clean, this place ......?"
　Even though there was dust everywhere in the hallway, there was no strange smell and no strange objects to be found.
<Page27>
　This is just a floor under renovation then.
　There is no sign of the disastrous conditions that existed at the hotel.
<Page28>
"You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier. ......
<Page29>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
　That moment.
<Page30>
"I'm not sure what to say.　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page31>
　It's a good idea to be prepared for a sudden human voice.
　In the entrance of the stairs, two people with a flashlight were standing.
<Page32>
".................."
　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.
　Both of them are male, and their ages are not so different from mine.
　The only thing in their hands is a flashlight. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page33>
"I'm not sure if you're aware of what you're doing.　Are you aware that you're doing something wrong?　What is this guy, isn't he lame?　Doesn't he look scared?　Isn't he too different from us?　Hey Toshi, do you know this guy with glasses?
<Page34>
"No, I don't know him. If I knew a nerd like him, I'd die of embarrassment.
　Hey, Bokuu there, come over here, okay?　If you run away, you'll get hurt badly, okay?　Or should I kill him? Technically, I can kill you for trespassing, right?"
<Page35>
　The pair laughed and did not move from their place ...... in front of the elevator.
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page36>
"I'm not sure what to make of that.　Don't you want to run away?　I'm sure you'll run away from this situation. I'm not sure what to make of this, Toshi.
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.　I'm sure you'll agree.　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
"..............."
　In the dark, the eyes of the two men seemed to glow dully.
<Page37>
"..................
　What do we do?
　You can either run away or get the story out of them.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　I'm not sure if I can confirm that with these two guys.
<Page38>
"I'm not sure if this is bonus time or not.
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page39>
"Shut up, Hal. Shut up for one minute.
　So, what do you think, Otaku? Are you just a nerd?
"..............."
<Page40>
　I'll get the information and sort out the situation.
　I'll keep an eye on the duo's movements.
<Page41>
"...... Excuse me. I heard that you can get a part-time job here. ......
　In a voice that sounded unsure of itself, I looked at the face of the man called Toshi.
<Page42>
"You can get a part-time job at ....... Where did you hear about it?　You can find a lot of people who are looking for a great deal more than just a great deal more.
"I found out about it through people. You can get a lot of money if you spend a night in an apartment at the north entrance.

"Ha---!"
　I resume breathing. Get oxygen into your bloodstream.
<Page2>
　Don't forget. This vampire is supposed to be emitting high temperatures.
　A decent creature can be fatally injured just by approaching it.
　I've tasted it once in a hotel. ......!
<Page3>
"......!"
　But it's too late. I'm not sure what to do.
<Page4>
　I've lost all feeling in my ankle.
"Fly, ......!"
　I try to jump to the side with all my might, but I can't move.
<Page5>
　The squeak in my ankle earlier told me that I was already done.
　It's not inflammation from high temperatures, but an unidentified pain that's causing my entire body to ...... lose its ability to function!
<Page6>
　I look up. In front of you is a cloak soaked in blood.
　The vampire's right arm is swung down on my face.
　---I'm not sure what to do.
　I can't handle such a simple movement. It's the same speed as before, but my body is heavy. I can't move. I can't dodge. In this, the moment he grabs my head, I'll be crushed like a tomato.
<Page7>
　But.
　The harvest of the human head fruit called Tono Shiki was blocked by a bullet that exploded from the side.
<Page8>
　I think that the bullet ...... is also a kind of rocket shot.
　I'm sure you'll agree. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page9>
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.

　No, my legs are still heavy. ......!
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.

<Page14>
"No.
　I opened my eyes and there she was standing there, the schoolgirl.
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
<Page15>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　The tongue of flame that spews out is bounced off an invisible wall and doesn't reach either me or her.
<Page16>
"..............."
　The female student is unconcerned even in the face of the flames.
　I wanted to call out to her back, but I couldn't leave the fallen Noel-sensei alone now either.
<Page17>
"It's a good idea to keep your eyes open. I'm not sure what to do. If you stay put, you'll wake up."
　I huffed at the girl's voice.

　I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what's going on.
"------"
<Page22>
　...... substitute.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for a new way of life.
　That was Ciel senior. ......?
　I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what's going on.
<Page23>
　I'm not sure what to say.
"I'm sure you've heard of it.
<Page24>
"It seems you're listening. It helps to talk quickly.
　...... Since that's the case, Tono-kun, please don't move an inch as it is. I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page25>
　Ciel senior cut his gaze from me and faced the vampire in the distance.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.

<Page27>
""......, but not discipline. To travel to such a remote place, it is a hungry beast itself. When did the deputy become a beast that likes to cheat?"
<Page28>
"You're the one who's hungry.
　I don't know what kind of mortal you are, but if you have a name, give it to me.
　If you have a name, you can use it as a guide to sort out your papers later."
<Page29>
"...... I have no name to give.
　　I am, as you see, an avenger who crossed the sea with a single hearse."
<Page30>
"The other day there was a case where a transport ship of unknown affiliation was lost off the coast,......, was it you?
　I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to make of it.　It is the ultimate in downfall to go on an expedition to a foreign country where even the race is different."
<Page31>
　It's a simple, but harsh provocation.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page32>
"...... That's right, agent.
　I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that there is no food in my country. The castle's storerooms are already empty. The humans fled a century ago. Even you dogs won't come near my land.
　It's a barren wasteland without a single plant. But it is full of life. It's too different from these bloody cities."
<Page33>
　...... Unbelievable.
　He was not provoked. Not only that, but he's having a decent conversation with a human being. ......!
<Page34>
　What's the difference from the hotel?
　Perhaps it's hunger. It's your stomach.
　From what I can see, the guy now has plenty of room for both body and soul. ......!
<Page35>
"So what are you doing in this town?
　Isn't poverty a virtue in this country?"
"The reason I came into this country was to heal and to avenge.
　I came to this ugly city to escape the torment of tearing my body and tearing my heart."
<Page36>
"....... I was hoping for a witty explanation, but the point is hunger? I'm disappointed. You don't have to tell me who you are. You are nothing more than a common mortal who wants to suck human blood.
<Page37>
　I'm not sure how Vrouve received the words of ...... senior.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the website.

　　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　　Do you not understand my suffering?"
"No, sir. The heat and the ice passed long ago.
<Page39>
"......, I see. You are a difficult woman.
　　Then go after your teacher. There is no past with you."
<Page40>
　I'm not sure what to do.
"I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page41>
"That much ......?"
　I'm not sure what to say.
　As if to ridicule the enemy's unawareness.

　Anyway, it's safe, so let's leave it like this for a while. I'm not sure what to do with it, but I'm sure it'll be fine. The first step is to drain the magic power of the opponent.

　The more blood he consumes, the more morbidly cloudy his eyes become.
　This is due to the temperature of the chapel dropping rapidly.
<Page56>
　---That's right.
　It was like this at the hotel. Alcade said he was a fireman. But he's not. Quite the opposite. It's not bloodlust he's suffering from, it's...

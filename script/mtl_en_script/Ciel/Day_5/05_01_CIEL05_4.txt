"Tono ......-kun?"
"Senpai ......!　Good, I noticed!　We'll talk later, get up early!　Vrouve is coming!
<Page9>
"Oh ...... yes, thank you ......
Why Tono-kun?
　A dream?　It wasn't a dream, was it?　Are you an idiot?　Why are you really here?　You asked me to go home so many times!
<Page10>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page11>
"I'm sure you'll agree.　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　---I'm not sure what to do.　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page12>
"It's just that Tono-kun isn't strong enough, he's just a bit above average!
　Just get out of here!　It's not your problem, you can still make it now!
<Page13>

　Yes. It's a lie that running away will save you.
　The choice to flee itself is fraught with debt.

"Tono-kun, that's...
"Isn't that right, senpai? You can't solve the problem by running away. I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　That night.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
"If you really want to save your life, you have to kill him here, even if you're scared.
<Page16>
　...... is all I can do.
　The only thing I can do is kill him, short term.
　I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but it's a good idea.
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time and money. ......
　If you can kill the minus that comes after this, I'll gladly jump into his bosom once more.
<Page17>
"Anyway, leave it to me!　Let me do it with you, senior!
"I'm sure you'll be able to find a lot more information on this on the web.
No, no, no!　I'm not sure what to say.　There is no reason for you to do that!
<Page18>
　It wasn't my reason, it was the reason this man needed to use me so badly.
　---How good.
　Even in this situation, he still sees a bastard like me as something to protect...
<Page19>
"Then give me a reward!
　If I help you kill him, if I do..."
<Page20>
　Damn, I can't think of a reward that sounds right.
　A reward?　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
　I'm not going to lie, I've been excited about this for a while now. In the event that you're a healthy boy, you can't help but lust after such a fresh body to be shown.
<Page21>
　I'm not sure what to do with this body, but I can think of a lot of things I'd like to do with it. But it will be ruined, everything will be ruined. In the first place, it's over with one punch.
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.　Do you want to register as a friend?　I'm sure you'll be able to figure out how to get the best out of it.　I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'm sure it's a lot better than any other reason. I love this guy. I'm here because I can't leave him alone. In the event that you've got a lot of money, you'll be able to buy a lot of things, and you'll also be able to buy a lot of things.
<Page22>
"I'm sorry.　I'm not sure what to do.　I'm not sure what to do.　I'm not sure what to do.
"I'm not sure what to say.　But I can only cook a few things!
"Yeah, that's it then!　It's nice to have something special!

　There is no clear strategy, no effective trickery.

"----senpai?"
"............Two, be sure to protect it. You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier. Concentrate on getting behind it."
"Yes, sir. And the other one?
<Page26>
"Do not think about me in any way. I don't have to tell you anymore, but I'm tough as iron."
<Page27>
　There was a hint of shame and self-mockery in his voice.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time.
<Page28>
　I leave my senior.
　I confront the vampire who walks up to me from the other side.
　The carnage in the hotel. The hell in the catacombs.
　I think back to those scenes and stop thinking about using them as a driving force for killing each other.
<Page29>
　At most, you have one minute of satisfactory activity.
　During that time, I discard all human emotions.
　Fear and elation will be behind you.
　---From now on.
　　　　I will become a machine that only sees death.
<Page30>
　I think again.
　The brilliance of a strong life is just like a twinkling star.
<Page31>
　I'm not sure what to make of this.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. So there's no ignoring it.
　Suddenly, there was a human hope that we might be able to have a conversation now.
<Page32>
　But mutual understanding is not necessary.
　I don't regard him as a living thing.
　He doesn't see me as a thing, either.
　We are more equal than ever.
　We already know each other well enough.
<Page33>
　We're only 40 meters apart.
　It is too short for the last meeting.
　Four seconds in time. It is a moment of two breaths.
<Page34>
　The ice block that was released passed by ignoring me.
　He was right on target. He stabbed the fatigued senior before I could even get close.
<Page35>
　---He didn't look back.
　There was no room for that. I click my teeth and step into his gap.
<Page36>
　A knife and a spear.
　The reach of their weapons is unmatched.
　In order for me to get through his line, I have to get through this first move.
<Page37>
　It's a blow fired with a strength that transcends humanity.
　There's no way I can dodge it.
　I'm not sure how it happened, but he's no longer the vampire I knew.
<Page38>
　There is a light in his eyes. There is reason and experience at the tip of the cut. The stupidity of relying on overflowing violence has been removed from his body.
　In other words.
　Here is a simple creature that, like me, will do everything in its power to survive.
<Page39>
"---!"
　More than that.
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page40>
　If we are a single functioning creature, she is a complex of talents.
　I put my back to her and my instincts kick in.
　That woman's performance still surpasses ours, even when we're piled on top of each other.
<Page41>
　And the climax of one minute began.
　The woman and the vampire strike each other from the front.
　The stab of a small soldier who turns to the back.
　The knight never shows his back and stands around while keeping the two enemies in sight.
<Page42>
　The intersection of the blade which seems to dance.
　It is like a symphony struck with superb technique.
　The blade of the guillotine which rotates. The blow of the knife which passes through the gap. The spear of ice that strikes the vital point of coordination precisely while playing them at the same time.
<Page43>
"---, a --- ...... ...!"
　Despite being hastily made, our breaths are in sync.
　The woman stands around so that I'm in the shade.
　I slide my foot to stay out of the woman's range of motion.
<Page44>
　The attack and defense of the paper-thin.
　The voltage which rises without limit.
　The concentration which condenses every second.
　For me, killing an enemy means that I continue to see an enemy.
<Page45>
　How dazzling.
　I have never continued to look at one "death" so far.
　---At the end...
<Page46>
　I perceived a principle.
　That which can never be understood.
　I saw a light that should not be seen in a form of thought that constructs theories with language and records.
　Death is the standard of zero common to all things.
　With it as the extreme point, the focus of perception was there.
<Page47>
　It was the memory of the snowfield.
　It was the memory of persecution.
　It was the memory of drifting.
　It was the memory of redemption.
　It was the memory of rebellion.
　In other words, it was the end of a knight.
<Page48>
　The man was falsely accused and was forced to leave his country. He lost his hometown to politics.
　The place of exile was the end of the world.
　It was a sea of extreme cold where no man could live.
　He was marooned on the bottom of the sea and had no choice but to continue living.
　There was nothing but cold.
　There was only pain.
　What saved the decaying man was a woman like a decaying tree, who had escaped from both humans and the dead.
<Page49>
　There was a brief spring.
　The man loved the flowers that bloomed in the snowfield, loved the birds, and killed people as he sang.
　He had ten consorts to comfort him.
　His loyalty to his lord was synonymous with a wall of ice that never melted.
<Page50>
　But the pain in his soul could not be healed.
　He could not resist the dryness known as the cold.
　The man gave up being a knight in order to escape the cold.
　Even though he was kidnapped.
　He closed the only sunshine with his own hands.
<Page51>
　That is this man.
　A vampire named Vroob.
　Its essence is coldness and betrayal, drifting and regret.
<Page52>
　Ah... this one can be killed.
　If it's a principle that can be put into words, it's a human one.
　Rejoice, vampire.
　Now I can kill you once and for all.
<Page53>
　The inner sea of stars, the canopy that covers Sola, proclaims.
　Cursed be our ancestors.
　Let there be a curse on the world of man.
　The principle has not yet been established. The foundations of this planet are too fragile.
<Page54>
"------ you."
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page55>
"What did you see in my eyes, ............！！！！！！！！！！！?"
"Tono-kun, get back ......!
<Page56>
　You can hear the voice.
　I don't have the strength to look at them.
　What a mistake. I'm not sure what to do. I'm dizzy from lack of oxygen.
　You can't even catch the spear that is now approaching in front of you ......, let alone turn around to your senior!

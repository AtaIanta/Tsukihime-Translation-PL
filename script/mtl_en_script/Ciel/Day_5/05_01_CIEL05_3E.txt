"Ha, ha, ha---!"
　The key to the door that locked the rooftop was cut with a knife.
　But there was no sign of anything that looked like an elevator on the top floor.
<Page2>
"Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it ......!"
　I ran down the stairs, relying on the light from the emergency lamp.
　In the event that you are going to be descending into the midst of the vampire's rampage, the fear is gone.
　The reason is obvious. I'm now frustrated, sad and angry, anyway. ......!
<Page3>
"Alcade's guy, what's with the meek annihilation,......!"
　I want to scream at my own misunderstanding.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's not that he's an asshole or a bad guy.
　It's a non-human creature that operates on a different set of values than we do.
　So... it was stupid of me to expect him to have human common sense.
<Page4>
"But still... I couldn't help but expect it, damn it!
　...... Not because he pardoned the murderer, Tono Shiki.
　I want to think of that guy as special.
　I can't help but hate that woman who smiles so purely like a lie.
<Page5>
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page6>
"Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!"
　But that's over. This is not the time for such sentimentality.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　In addition to that---I'm going to break the Vrouve's line.
<Page7>
　I arrived at the elevator.
　I go inside and press the button for the first floor.
　There's no time to get lost.
　This is not the time to get lost in the first place.
　I take a deep breath. Check your body. There's nothing wrong with ....... Your whole body is working properly.
<Page8>
　I repeat, there is no fear.
　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page9>
"It is ---- a.
　Your breathing will speed up.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page10>
　We've reached the ...... ground floor.
　You can't rely on Alcade.
　I grabbed my knife back and ran out into the cold air swirling crater.
<Page11>
　A huge cubic hole in the world.
　That was my feeling about the foreign object in front of me.
<Page12>
　A transparent box over 40 meters on a side.
　The material is reminiscent of acrylic.
　It is not the color of the wall that makes it look blue-black, but the thing stuck inside that makes it look so.
<Page13>
　White conglomerates blowing around inside the box.
　The icicles that grow in a row like fangs.
　The hell of the extreme cold that does not reach human wisdom is packed in that.
<Page14>
　This is not a box. It is a cage.
　Something that should not be in reality.
　A cage that contains things that should not be released on earth.
　In it...
<Page15>
"Senpai ......!"
　There. Ciel senior is in here.
　In the extreme cold, even breathing is frozen.
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page16>
　I'm not sure what to say.
　An ultra-low temperature that cannot happen on the surface of this planet.
　In the cold air that does not allow the survival of any plants and animals, two horsemen collide.
<Page17>
　One horseman is the source of the curse, Vrove Arkhangelis.
　The other is the agent in the form of a girl, dressed in torture gear.
<Page18>
　The blizzard has blocked the view.
　A foothold rippled by glaciers.
　In the extreme situation where even breathing leads to death, ice bullets and bullets collide with each other.
　Sixty minutes have passed since the battle between the two sides began.
　That battle time itself was already a miracle.
<Page19>
　The stone thrower that scatters sparks of 7.62mm.
　The large caliber bullets that are said to be excessive firepower on the battlefield are unleashed on the vampires.
<Page20>
　It is not the violence to injure a soldier and to make it impossible to fight represented by 8mm and 9mm.
　This is a modern weapon for killing vampires, adjusted to blow up flesh and iron.
<Page21>
　It is called "burning to death".
　This is the exclusive armor of Ciel, the agent, separated from the scriptures that have seven causes of death.
<Page22>
　But. In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　For bullets, you need low temperatures.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　The way both of them are armed is the very confrontation between civilization and nature.
<Page23>
　The vampire does not move.
　This extreme cold is the hell his imagination has conjured up.
The delusion that "without blood you will freeze to death".
　That is the curse that makes Vroob Arkhangelis immortal.
　As long as it is a curse that is bound to the cold, Vroob in a state of extreme cold cannot step out freely.
　He is a "poison" that will only pollute the earth like that until he gets the warmth of blood.
<Page24>
　Nevertheless...
　The curse is enough to cover a city, but not to create such a low temperature.
　This situation was brought about by the agent's decision.
　This is the result of compressing the vampire curse, which is four kilometers in diameter, into a 40-meter square box and sealing the entire space.
<Page25>
　In a sense, this ward can be said to be the body of the agent itself.
　The girl was receiving the cold wave that hit the city with her body alone.
<Page26>
　The low temperature that strikes the girl is not just minus 100 degrees Celsius.
　The local decline reaches minus 273 degrees Celsius, which is said to be no more than that.
　The torrent of the curse that freezes in an instant if it is normal.
　In the event that you're in the market for a brand-new pair of shoes, then you're in the right place.
<Page27>
　The iron armor that gives a creak.
　As the pollution of the vampire twists the laws of physics, this armor is also woven by a concept outside the laws of physics.
<Page28>
　The hearse that was once called the iron virgin.
　A machine of death that pierces the human placed inside with countless needles.
<Page29>
"If you are to prove your innocence, you must fit inside this.
　If you survive, you are a witch. If you die, you are a human."
<Page30>
　It is a product of the Dark Ages, completed as an object of horror, taking many lives under its slogan.
<Page31>
"But do not grieve. The result is the same for all.
　Whether you are a witch or a man, if you are chosen, the day will not come when you will be free until you die."
<Page32>
　Those wrapped up in this hearse can only be set free by their own death.
　Once it becomes the target of its bankrupt delusion, the sacrifice will be locked away until death.
<Page33>
　The cursed iron dress.
　A conceptual armament that only torments the sacrifice.
　However. She used that characteristic as a rather good thing.
<Page34>
"It can't be removed until the user dies."
　It turns into.
"It cannot be removed until the user is dead."
　It means a characteristic.
<Page35>
　Only an internal, debilitating death, not a violent external one, will destroy this hearse.
<Page36>
　That's the same thing, even in extreme cold.
　In front of this protection, any poor environment will hang its head. Because, after all, there is no blame and suffering more than the inside of it.
<Page37>
　Therefore, its name is the torture tool, the purity proof.
　It is a ceremonial garment that results in a debilitating or torturous death.
　As long as the magic power of the user does not run out, as long as the user does not die and is not proven to be a witch, the sanctity of the saint that guarantees the minimum life activity ---!
<Page38>
"---It's a tremendous consumption of magic power.
　　I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page39>
　A voice echoes in the white darkness.
　In the event that you have any kind of questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page40>
"But there is a limit to that as well.
　　Even if you can continue to die indefinitely...
　　The battle will not end until you kill your opponent."
<Page41>
"......!"
　In the event you're not sure what you're looking for, there are a few things you can do.
　In the event that you're looking for the best way to get the most out of your business, you'll want to take a look at the following.
　The reason is that every direction and every thing is a deadly weapon that kills her.
<Page42>
　Her whole body is hit hard by the rushing ice spears.
　The firearm in her hand is flung away.
　The weapon used to shoot the immobile enemy is thrust into the earth like a tombstone.
<Page43>
""Well... you've dropped your only weapon, agent.""
　As if to say that's the end of the matter.
<Page44>
"Run to pick it up.
My spear will shatter your back."
　The vampire understands. The vampire understands that the substitute's armor is specially made.
　And that destruction requires a stronger concept, a curse.
<Page45>
　The curse of extreme cold is merely a physiological phenomenon of his.
　It's like the breath he wields just to stay alive. The armor will not be shattered by such a thing.
If you are protected by the concept of "unbreakable", you can only offset it by hitting it with the exact opposite concept.
<Page46>
　This is also one of the fate.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page47>
　I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page48>
"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to make of that.
　However, the substitute did not look back at the firearm that was played.
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where by and how to use it, please do not hesitate to contact us.
<Page49>

<Page50>
In the name of the Lord, the third cause of death, come.
　The girl chants to herself.
　In the event you're not sure what you're looking for, you'll be able to find out more about it here.
　If so, it will be time for a white-knuckle battle to scatter the blades ......!
<Page51>
　The hammer of the holy woman who bared her fangs.
　What was given to the girl is not only guns and armor.
　Burned to death. Sick death. Bleeding death. Death by collision. Mental death. Tortured to death. Absolution death.
　According to her, these are the seven causes of death that the law assigns to people.
　The thing which crystallized it as a weapon is the scripture which she has.
<Page52>
"[ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00]------!"
　Roaring like a beast, the girl runs through the white hell.
　The heat trapped inside the body and the accelerating magic power are discharged like fire.
　Trampling glaciers and fleshing out immovable vampires.
""Woman ------!""
<Page53>
　The sound of swords echoing.
　The thing that the girl holds in her hand is too rude cutting machine.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
It's a great way to make sure that you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page54>
　Gut the chest. Cut off the arm. Split the head.
　The sword of the substitute gives a fatal wound without mercy.
　But the victory or defeat is not decided.
　A vampire is an immortal monster. The damage of just killing them restores them in the blink of an eye.
<Page55>
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　At this moment, still.
<Page56>
"............ this, is."
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page57>
　It's not anger or hatred.
　It was a joyous awakening that had been frozen long ago.
<Page58>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　　Isn't this sword line devised by the mortals to kill the mortals?"
"------!"
<Page59>
　The substitute does not answer, but sees more swords.
　But the fourth blow does not reach him.
　In the event that you have any questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
　The dead that were just there transformed into the face of the knight that once felled the king.
<Page60>
""---That's a face that says, "How do you know that?
　　Twenty-seventh Ancestor, Sword Monk Be-Ze.
　　I was taught by him once before.
　　Looking at the times... So you're the last disciple."
<Page61>
　The substandard weapons collide.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page62>
"......!"
"Ha---!"
<Page63>
　I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　The disadvantage was too great for one side from the beginning of this battle.
<Page64>
""Good. The skill of the sword is even, or you are better.
　　But the fact that you're a human being is your downfall.
　　How many more minutes can this warding ...... last?"
<Page65>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　When the girl's limbs drop their performance even slightly...
　The knight's spear will shoot through the enemy's true core with all its spirit.

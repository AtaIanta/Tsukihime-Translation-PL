"What's wrong, senpai?　You have a pouting face.
"What?　Oh, you know.
I was a little surprised to see that Tono-kun was calmer than me.
<Page2>
"I'm just used to this kind of thing because our family was originally a strict one. I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one who's a little nervous about this.
<Page3>
"Oh, that's right.
　Actually, I was really curious about the story I heard at lunch.
"......The lunchtime story was about, you know, my parents' house?
　I'm not sure what to do.
<Page4>
"It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
　It's a good idea. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
"It's boring to listen to you talk about our house. I think it's a waste of time.
<Page5>
"It doesn't have to be boring.
　I just want to hear it.
"...... Oh. You are very curious, aren't you?
　This is a great way to get the most out of your business.
<Page6>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　You said you were going back to your own home, but you never went back to your parents' home before?
<Page7>
"Yes. Due to various reasons, I haven't been back to my parents' house for almost seven years. I had an accident when I was ten years old, and since then I've been suffering from chronic anemia.
　In the event you have any questions regarding where and the best way to get in touch with us, please do not hesitate to contact us.
<Page8>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　How's your scar?
"That one has healed perfectly. The only aftereffect is anemia, but my dad says he was ready for it before the accident, so I'm not worried about it.
<Page9>
"I'm sorry to have to tell you this ...... painful story.
　So, you are saying that these relatives are the ones who raised you from the age of 10?
<Page10>
"I'm sure you're right. They were from a family called Arima, and they were very good people, too good for me.
　My words were filled with gratitude for those people, even if I did not consciously know it.
　I think it was a blessing to have been in that house for seven years.
<Page11>
"It's in the past tense, isn't it? This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time with your family and friends.
<Page12>
"What?　No, it's not like that.
　I'm not sure what to make of it. I thought that Keiko and the others would always live together.
"Did you know you wouldn't be called back?
　Even though Tono-kun is the eldest son of the Tono family?
<Page13>
"Yes. ...... To tell you the truth, the recuperation life is just a front. I'm not sure what to say. It's like being thrown out of a car because of an injury.
<Page14>
"............ Are you sure you're not mistaken about that?
"Yes, it is.
　If it is a misunderstanding, so much the better.
<Page15>
　React to the senior's words as honestly as possible.#I'm sure my mouth is smiling.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page16>
"But you can't confirm that anymore.
　But we can't confirm that anymore, because he passed away just a few days ago. This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your vacation.
　...... You're right.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page17>
"You'll be able to find a lot more information on the web.
　So you're going back to your parents' house."
"Yes. The new head of the family urged me to come home as soon as possible. It's a good idea to have a good time.
<Page18>
　I'm not sure what to do.
　In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.
<Page19>
"It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　It is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your money.
"You can. As long as I can answer.
<Page20>
"'I see. Then don't hesitate.
　You just spoke of the people of Arima's house in the past tense. You yourself are already thinking of them separately. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page21>
　I'm not sure what to make of that.
　It's not your real parents, but your father and mother.
　It's a strange building that should be a relative's house.
　But that doesn't matter at all.
<Page22>
"No, I loved them. They didn't care that we weren't related by blood, and they were so warm that I felt bad that I was alone and depressed.
　They were so warm that I felt sorry that I was alone and depressed. I felt that I was not so naive as to believe in such unquestionable love.
<Page23>
　---I knew that these people loved me.
　　　　So, as soon as possible.
　　　　I have to become a real family.
<Page24>
　That's what I've been telling myself since I was a little girl.
　...... really, from a long time ago.
　I think I've been vowing to do this over and over again for a long time, to the point of losing my mind.
<Page25>
"But it's not enough, is it?
"Yes. You can find a lot of people who are looking for the best way to get the most out of their life.
<Page26>
　No matter how happy you are to be loved, the next day you will feel like a stranger.
　I can't think of it as my own, and I just can't keep feeling it.
<Page27>
　So, at least.
　I'm trying every day to remember the fact that they cared for me.
<Page28>
"This is especially true when it comes to family. You can't give back the love that is stronger than the love that your father and mother give you.
　Why...?"
<Page29>
　I couldn't get the idea out of my head that since I couldn't do that, I wasn't a real family.
　Maybe I had some bad trauma as a child. This is the reason why, no matter where you go, you will always feel like a stranger to your family.
<Page30>
　The senior is silent.
　He averted his gaze and squared his shoulders apologetically.
<Page31>
"'Look, it was a boring story.
　I'm sorry, senior, for wasting your time."
"It's not that. It was a very meaningful conversation.
　In order to soften the atmosphere, the senior forced a smile on his face.
<Page32>
"You can find a lot of people who are looking for a great deal more. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page33>
"I'm basically a laid-back guy. I've made it my motto to "enjoy the moment as much as possible".
　It's better to be happy looking forward to what's ahead than what's over, right?"
　Well, that's what Arihiko told me.
<Page34>
"Looking forward to the future"?
　That's a good idea. I want to support you as much as I can.
<Page35>
"But enjoy it as much as possible. .......
　You can find a lot more information on this at ....... So, for the time being, do you want to go to school together tomorrow?
<Page36>
"I'm sorry.
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time and money.
<Page37>
"You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.　In the event that you're not sure what you're looking for, there are a number of things you can do.
"I'm not sure what to say.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
<Page38>
　This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time with your family.
　It's a good idea to take a look at your own personal life.
　The tea was completely cooled by the long conversation.
<Page39>
　After that, we continued talking for about an hour.
　In the event that you're not familiar with this kind of thing, you're going to be tired.
<Page40>
　What was especially popular was the story about the school trip. It seems that the senior couldn't go to the school trip. I'm not sure if you've heard of it, but I have.
<Page41>
I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'd like to see Tono-kun at that time, too.
　If he said that with a smile, I would have blushed.
<Page42>
　There was no end to the topics we talked about, but the sun was going down soon.

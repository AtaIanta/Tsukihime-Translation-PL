　It was lunchtime and the corridors were cluttered with students passing by.
　Most of them head for the cafeteria, but some of them visit their friends' classes with their lunchboxes in hand, or head for the courtyard or gym.
<Page2>
　As I mingled with the flow of students, I was wondering whether I should have a solid lunch in the cafeteria or buy a loaf of bread from the store.
<Page3>
　In the end of the corridor, I saw a familiar figure of a senior.
<Page4>
"......?"

"That's right. I was just wondering whether to go to the cafeteria or to the store.
<Page14>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that. I'll buy you a drink to apologize for this morning, so let's go to the cafeteria.

"No, what's this all about?
<Page48>
"What does it mean? It's lunch for Tono-kun and me. What else do you see?
"It looks like curry to me. ......
<Page49>
"Of course, it's the classic curry that everyone loves.

"Itadakimasu.
　I was so desperate that I dug my spoon into the curry rice.
　And.
"Son of a bitch, Tono-kun!
　The man who had been dead since a while ago finally rebooted.
<Page54>
"I'm sure you've got a lot of questions.　There's a word for that!　I'm going to go to the back of the school building because I'm busy, and then the two of you can have a chat.　And if you have any left over, please give me those curry noodles!

<Page57>
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm going back on my promise. I'm sorry I broke my promise to you. You see, it was Tono-kun who gave me trouble this morning.
<Page58>
"It's a good idea, because it's a reasonable reason. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
　And. How badly did this guy do to you?
<Page59>
"We bumped into each other on the train early in the morning, and when we were chatting, the other passengers warned me.
　You can't do that. You have to think about the people around you. It wasn't Tono's fault, but he got angry on my behalf.
<Page60>
"Oh, an early morning train? It's up to the individual to decide what they want to talk about.
Hmm?　Early morning?　I understand Tono, but did you commute to school by train?
<Page61>
"'I'm on my way back from volunteering this morning. It's picking up trash in the park.
　See, wasn't there a notice on the school bulletin board?　Students are asked to participate voluntarily.
<Page62>
"Oh, that thing at the beach park. As expected of a senior, thank you for your hard work.
　But because you do that, the teachers will take advantage of you. I hope you don't let them get too carried away, because they're always slacking off whenever they get the chance.
<Page63>
"It's okay, I do it because I like it.
Besides, the teachers are thinking about the school properly. I'm not impressed with the way you're talking to me now, Inui-kun.

<Page70>
　I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
　It's not just curry rice, but curry udon as well.
<Page71>
　The doctor has warned me not to eat too much, but this time I have to finish the entire meal to make my senior feel better.
　I'm going to enjoy the curry and rice before my satiety center is filled.
<Page72>
　Meanwhile, my senior and Arihiko were talking about their house.
　I knew that Arihiko didn't have any parents, but I heard that my senior also lived alone.
<Page73>
　I heard that the senior's apartment is rather close to Soya station.
　It's not the north exit that has the downtown area, but the south exit that has the office district, and rented an apartment in the residential area that spreads out to the east.
<Page74>
"Oh, well.
　By the way, where do you live, Tono-kun?
"Yes?"
　I was eating curry and rice in silence, but the senior quickly spoke up.
<Page75>
"I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I think it's a good idea.
　After all, I'm changing my residence from today.
　It's a bit awkward to explain the situation. If possible, I'd like to keep it a secret and cover it up. ......
<Page76>
　......If you're staring straight at me like this, you can't even tell a bad lie.
<Page77>
"I'm not sure what to make of it.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page78>
"What?　I'm not sure what to make of it.　I'm sure you'll agree that it's not fair that I'm the only one who doesn't know where Tono-kun's house is.
...... Um, is that weird?
<Page79>
"I'm not sure what to say.
　I'm sure you'll agree that it's not fair, but it's a strange thing to worry about, isn't it, senpai?
<Page80>
"Mmm. It's not a strange thing.
　If I don't know where you live, I won't be able to visit you when something happens, will I?
<Page81>
　This is a great way to make sure you get the most out of your vacation.

"No, you won't.
　There are no such plans at the moment.
<Page83>
"..............."
　It seems that the words you just said were a lukewarm pleasure.
　There is no malice at all in the senior.
　I'm sure you'll agree. I'm sure he's a natural.
<Page84>
"My house is also in this town. It takes less than 30 minutes on foot.
　You see, when you go up to the suburbs from the north exit, there is a residential area on the hill. It's at the end of the hill.
<Page85>
"Oh, that's right. You're moving in today, aren't you?
　Arihiko made a deliberate affirmation.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page86>
"I'm not sure what to say. Tono-kun, were you a transfer student?
"What?"
　I'm sure you'll agree.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
<Page87>
"I'm not sure what to say. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your money.
　I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one.
"Because Tono-kun said you moved...
<Page88>
"It's not like anyone becomes a transfer student when they move. It's just a change of address, the school hasn't changed.
　I've been staying at my relative's house until now, but from today I'm just going back to my old house."
<Page89>
　The incomprehensibly surprised senior seemed to be convinced, "I see.
<Page90>
"So you just changed your house.
　And now you've moved to a residential area in the suburbs.
"'Right. In an ostentatious place on a hill.
<Page91>
"I see, that makes sense now. Then could it be that Tono-kun's house is that Tono residence?
<Page92>
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　In the event that you've been in the area for seven years and haven't returned, the Tono mansion in your memory is as big as a castle to me.
<Page93>
"That's what I mean. I know I'm out of place, but I can't help it if I've moved away.
<Page94>
"Hmmm. I'm sure you're not too keen on the idea.
　I'm not sure what to make of it. It will feel like a stranger's home for a while, won't it?
"I don't know. I'm not sure because I haven't been back yet.
　Well, it's easier for me because I have my own refuge, your house.
<Page95>
"What's that? I'm not sure what to make of it. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're going to do with the money you have.
<Page96>
　I think it's because of Arihiko's bad behavior, but I don't want to talk about it because it would complicate things.
　It's not a pleasant topic of conversation for the Tono family, to be honest.
<Page97>
"I'm sure you'll agree. You two are really close, aren't you?
"Not really. Tono and I may compete with each other, but we never take each other's hand. We are enemies, so to speak, mademoiselle.
<Page98>
"But Tono-kun even stays at Inui's house, right?　You guys are really close, aren't you?
<Page99>
"That's not true, senpai. I'm not sure what you mean by that. You son of a bitch, you're holding back from the Arima people because you were left here.
<Page100>
"So he moved in with me because I had an empty room. You can find a lot of people who are interested in this kind of thing.
<Page101>
　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
　A lot of the time, it's just a matter of time before you'll be able to find the right one. ...... I'm sure that's the point. ...... Next time, bring along one of your souvenirs.

<Page104>
"I'm sure you'll agree. I'm sure you're right.
　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
　Arihiko is convinced. I think this kind of optimism is a real beauty.
<Page105>
"I'm sorry ...... Tono-kun.
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
<Page106>
"It's not like that. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. They're all super nice people. No, Arima's father is rather scary though.
　And yet this guy refuses to adopt me, and comes running to my place every holiday. What's really wrong with you?
<Page107>
"There's no reason to be dissatisfied. I just don't want to burden you any more because you've been so good to me.
<Page108>
　I've finished my curry and rice.
　The rest is a whole lot of curry udon for one person.
　I'm not sure what to make of it.

<Page119>
"I'm not sure what to say. It's a good idea to have a good time. Did you do something wrong again?
"It's not like that. What I want to ask is what's really going on in Tono.
"What do you mean?
<Page120>
"That's why Tono was sent away from elementary school, right? I don't know what the reason is, but it's been seven years since then. Why are you bringing your disowned son back now, your father?
<Page121>
"It's not that he was disowned.
　He just asked me to leave the house for some reason.
<Page122>
"Tono-kun, it's you. If there was a family that kicked their child out of the house for some reason, it wouldn't be a tragedy, it would be a funny story.
　But it's a step above horror, it's too cold to be funny!
<Page123>
　To tell the truth, even before he was involved in a car accident and hospitalized, he had a bad relationship with his father.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　What I remember from my childhood is the huge Western-style building and the pressure of the family motto, which seems to have been adapted to that Western-style building.
<Page124>
　The Tono family is also wealthy and a shareholder in several companies. His father, Tono Makihisa, is said to have been an ordinary businessman, but the assets he inherited from his grandfather were strong enough and the company management was smooth sailing.
<Page125>
　An anachronistic mansion.
　The mansion is an anachronism, but it is the life of the upper class, which values civility and history.
　The life in such a mansion must have seemed boring to his childish mind.
　That's why, when he was told that he would be entrusted to Arima's house, he accepted to leave the house without much resistance.
<Page126>
　I think the result was very good.
　I got along well with the people at Arima's house, and I treated Keiko, my mother-in-law, and Fumiomi, my father-in-law, as if they were my real parents.
　I have always longed for a normal family, and Tono Shiki has lived in Arima's house as if he were my real son.
<Page127>
　I don't think there are any regrets there.
　But there is one point. I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page128>
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time with your family.
　It's natural for them to resent you.
　This is a great way to make sure that you get the most out of your time with your family.
　It's easy to imagine what Akiha thinks of her brother, who has quickly fled the scene.
<Page129>
"...... That's right. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
"Right?　In addition to that, it comes with a decisive word: never cross the threshold again. In the world, such a thing is called disowned.
　I've never heard of it before, though. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page130>
"..............."
　................
　That's what I want to hear.

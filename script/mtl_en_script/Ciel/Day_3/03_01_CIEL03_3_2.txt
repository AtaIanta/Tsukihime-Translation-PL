　I'm not sure what to do.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
　I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.
<Page2>
I'm not sure what to say. Stop it. That word, in your mouth...
　But my heart is screaming.
　It's like it's going to explode if I don't get the truth out.
<Page3>
　No, no, no. No, no, no. It is not. No, no, no.
　No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. -----

"...... different."
　Don't turn away from it. That's the difference.
"I'm telling you it's not.
　No, no, no, that's exactly what I'm saying.
<Page5>
"So why are you at ......?　I don't know him. He's just some guy I saw on the street. ......!
　See, that's funny!　Why am I killing a mere stranger......!"
<Page6>
　There is no answer even if you shout.
　And the reason is clear.
　When I looked at her, I could only think of one thing.
<Page7>
"I'm ----."
　Yes, I...
　　　　　Tono Shiki wants to kill that woman.
<Page8>
　That was all I could think about at that time.
　It's just that my head was melting and I didn't try to put that image into words.
<Page9>
"Chiga -----u."
　I feel nauseous.
<Page10>
"Ugh, ugh, ugh."
　The stuff in my stomach comes back.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page11>
"Aaaaahhhh!"
　I rush out.
　You can't think of anything else to do.
　I just wanted to get away from here, so I left the strange apartment in a half-crazed frenzy.
<Page12>
　The stomach juices flow back.
　I knelt down on the ground and vomited up every last drop of juice from my guts.
　I cried out and vomited out the food and the stomach juices.
<Page13>
　There was nothing in my stomach.
　And yet, as if refusing to accept what had happened, as if trying to return to the normal routine, the body forces vomiting.
<Page14>
　It hurts.
　My insides seem to be burning.
　The tears don't stop and the body crumples to the ground like a piece of trash.
<Page15>
　...... I killed a man.
　It's a great way to get the most out of your time and money.
<Page16>
　I don't know why I felt that way.
　Why did I really kill him?
　I still don't know why I did it.
<Page17>
"------"
　But I don't care about myself.
　It's the endless regret and hatred that hits you in the chest.
<Page18>
　I've killed that woman.
　I killed her whole life.
　The relationship between her and the people around her.
　The future she had always dreamed of, everything...
　I, who had nothing to do with her, destroyed it with a laugh.
<Page19>
　...... Regret will not be forgiven.
　I'm not sure what to say.
<Page20>
I'm not going to...
　I want to pull out my eyeballs.
　I'm not even sure if I'm still normal.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
"Kill that woman".
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
<Page21>
　If ......, the answer is simple.
　I'm sure I'm crazy.
　Perhaps it was seven years ago.
　From an accident that should have killed him.
　From that time when he miraculously revived...

".................."
　I can't sleep and let my gaze swim.
　I'm not sure what I'm going to do or what I should do.
　I'm not sure what to do.
　I'm not sure what to do.

"Tono-kun. If you don't go to sleep soon, you'll be late tomorrow."
"...... senpai, are you awake ......?"
<Page13>
"Yes. You can't sleep until Tono-kun is asleep. I'm a girl after all.
"...... Sorry. I'm going to sleep in the kitchen after all.
<Page14>
"Please don't make me say it again. Tono-kun has just started to catch a cold, so I can't let him sleep in the kitchen. Just forget about the unpleasant things and go to sleep.
<Page15>
"----- disagreeable things."

"Sin," huh? I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
<Page20>
"But Tono-kun. There is no such thing as a person who doesn't sin in this society. Everyone is a sinner.
"...... Senpai. What kind of ...... is that?
<Page21>
"I'm not sure if I'm saying that everyone is a sinner.
　It's not that there are good people and bad people. It's just that some people inexplicably go astray for some reason or another.
　As long as we live, we all make mistakes. It's sad, but it's inevitable.
　Because human beings are animals that live like that. As long as we have wisdom, we can't help but trample on someone's happiness."

<Page24>
"......Yes, that doesn't save us, does it?
　But sins can be atoned for, can't they?
　There are no good people or bad people in the world. There are only those who can atone for their sins and those who cannot.
　Therefore, I think that unsaved people are those who cannot atone for their sins no matter what.
<Page25>
"No matter what, they can't atone..."
"Yes. But Tono-kun is a person who can atone. I don't know what I did, but Tono-kun is someone who can atone.
　If you can't sleep because of anxiety, you should think about how to make amends and live in the future.
　It's a very difficult thing to do, but you'll find that your head will soon be punctured and you'll be able to sleep easily.

　I was taught that atonement is not a result, but a way of being that is created in the process.
　That's what I mean by people who can atone and people who can't atone.

<Page29>

"It's easy to see why. Just now, I was a little moved. Tono-kun, you have a huge scar on your chest, right?
"Yes, but ...... why is that?
<Page31>
"I'm sure it was a very serious accident for you to have that many scars. A scar can distort your mind.
　It's not normal to have a scar that big and that still hasn't gone away.

　You will find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
　I'm sure you never hold a grudge against others, even when you're angry."

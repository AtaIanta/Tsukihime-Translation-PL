　------- It's cold.
　The sun is going to be down before you know it.
<Page2>
　------- I wonder how long it is now.

　I'm not sure what to do.
　I don't feel anything.
　And the noise that repeats.
　I don't care about the repetitive noises, or the freezing cold that could kill me.
<Page5>
　My body is shaking.
　Is it the cold, or the anxiety, or the fear, or the regret?
　I can't tell anymore.
　I killed a man, and I can't explain why I didn't.
<Page6>

　---To die.
　At any rate, the solution is rather easy.
<Page8>
　And yet, I can't.
　Because I'm still sane, I can't do it.
　There is a heart that fears death, and a heart that despises that such a thing does not become a solution to anything --- even atonement.
<Page9>
　A rasping noise.
　Body temperature drops as if rolling down a slope.
　---I can't die by myself.
　　　　But if you leave it alone, it will disappear like this.
　...... In the end, maybe it's for the best.
　Murderers like me, even if they live, anyway.

　Hurry.
　Just like this.
　I'm not sure.

"..............."
　That's not good.
<Page25>
　You can't do that.
　　　　　　　　　　　　I'm not sure what to do.
　I shake my head, asking him not to do that.
<Page26>
"It's ...... okay. I can't go home.
　There ...... s nowhere else I can go."
<Page27>
　That's right.
　You can't go home with this bloody body.
　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

"------"
　A long silence.
　The senior is staring at me in silence.

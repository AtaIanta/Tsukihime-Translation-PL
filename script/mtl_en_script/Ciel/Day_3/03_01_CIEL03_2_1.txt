　Shall we eat in ...... the classroom?
　However, I don't really have an appetite today.
　It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web, as well as to make sure that you're getting the most out of it. ......
<Page2>
"I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
"---"
　I've completely lost my appetite after seeing the dark face.
　Okay, I'll skip lunch. Thank you very much for the opportunity, Arihiko.
<Page3>
"I'm sorry, I'll pass today. Go finish it by yourself."
"What the hell, you're getting more and more unhealthy.
　What, you don't think a new life as an aristocrat is right for you?
<Page4>
"You know, I'm not an aristocrat. ...... Oh, no, maybe not. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
　I'm not sure what to say. It's more spacious than your room. And it's expensive.
"Seriously?　I'm not sure I want to live that kind of uncomfortable life.
<Page5>
　...... I'm sorry, I'll correct my earlier comment.
　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page6>
"...... Well, we can't help but talk about the building.
　I'm not sure what to make of it. In addition, if you stay overnight without permission, you will be severely questioned, it is like living in prison, right?
<Page7>
"Oh?　That's a good story, isn't it?
　Long live the control system. Young people should live tighter. You can't become a good adult if you start having fun while you're young.
"I agree. I agree. But it's very persuasive coming from you.
　I mean, as the ultimate role model.
<Page8>
"Is that so?　What's up with Tono being so straightforward today?
　Okay, okay, I'll give you one of those sweet buns!
"Don't worry about the food. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that. Your lunch break is over.
<Page9>
"Really?
　Then I'll eat it without reservation.
　Arihiko clasped his hands together and began to eat the pastry.
　It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
<Page10>
"I'm sure you'll agree.
　.......
　I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page11>
"I'm sorry.　Didn't you eat at the school cafeteria?
"It's not really a fixed meal. Anything is possible depending on the mood of the day.
<Page12>
　It's a good idea to take out a lunch box from a cute drawstring bag.
　This is a great way to get the most out of your day.

"I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one who's a little nervous about this.
　What do you want me to say, Tono-kun?
<Page15>
"No, I didn't mean to. ...... Are you weak in the morning by any chance?
"I'm not sure. I'm not very good at waking up early, actually.
　When I'm volunteering, I'm pretty reckless.
<Page16>
"My parents owned a bakery, so I was very early in the morning. My family owned a bakery, so we were very early in the morning, but I was always weak in the morning. Ever since I was a child, I was always getting angry with my father.
<Page17>
　What a bakery!
　I'm not sure what to do. I'm sure he imagined that there was a kamado in his room and that he was kneading flour with his white fingers and baking it.
<Page18>
"'My fight with your father lasted for about three years, but in the end
"If I had to discipline you, I'd rather work for two people."
　He said, "I'd rather work for two people than train you.
　Ever since then, I've been selfish when it comes to my waking hours.
<Page19>
　I've been selfish about my waking hours ever since.
"I'm not sure what to say. It's a bit unexpected.
　I'm sure you'll be pleased to hear that.
<Page20>
"It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. I'm not sure if I'm a good judge of character or not.
<Page21>
　...... It's true that you may not be to the point.
　I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out.
　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
<Page22>
"I see. ---But I like people who are not to the point.
　I feel at ease when I am with them.
　I'm sure you'll agree.
"So, the senior who is weak in the morning was usually in the school cafeteria?
<Page23>
"I'm not sure what to make of it. It's a collection of ready-made things.
　You two are cafeteria people, aren't you?
<Page24>
"I'm sure you'll agree that it's a great idea. In the first year, my sister used to make my meals for me, but since Tono's meals were either school cafeteria or bakery food, I had to adjust to it.
<Page25>
"Tono-kun is a moody person. Tono-kun is a moody person, isn't he?
"Yeah, yeah. If you go out with this kind of man, you will only get tired, so you should be careful too.

<Page29>
"I'm not sure what to say.　Tono-kun, are you not going to eat lunch?
"Yes, I'm not in the mood today.
<Page30>
"You're not going to eat ...... then you'll get hungry.
"It's okay, my health is more important than my appetite right now. And I'm not so weak that skipping lunch is going to help.
<Page31>
"Wow, that's amazing. I wouldn't be able to move if I skipped even one meal. I'm so hungry I'm going to collapse.
　...... It's embarrassing, isn't it, because I eat more than most kids, but I get hungry easily.

"But Tono-kun, are you sure you don't mind skipping lunch?
"I'm fine with it. It's not unusual to skip meals for an entire day. I've eaten breakfast today and I'm good to go until the evening.
<Page35>
"Mmm. I don't think that's a good idea.
　You'll break your body if you live like that.
<Page36>
"Don't worry, there are people who will take a good look at you.
　The doctor has warned me not to put on weight, and it's better for me to skip meals now and then.
　I want to be strong, but I have to keep my weight down.

Hm~?　Just when I thought the 10th day had started normally...
I went to school like normal and it ended like normal?
<Page2>
What's going on here, Ciel?
An error?　Didn't you make this future?
<Page3>
I don't think I made any bad choices. ......
What?　You broke your promise to your sister?
<Page4>
But the promise to the blonde girl is more important, isn't it?
This should be the correct route, but why ......?
<Page5>
What are you talking about?
<Page6>
I'm not sure what to do.
You're not a good brother to go out.
<Page7>
Tono-kun's collapsed many times before, but
But this day's "poor health" is something special.
<Page8>
It's a condition he won't recover from unless he rests for half a day.
Please rest well, okay?
<Page9>
Of course, you can ignore the meeting with Alcade.
It is OK to ignore the meeting with Alcade at all.
<Page10>
It's only a verbal agreement, so it's not legally enforceable.
And there's no penalty for doing so.
<Page11>
It's not that kind of problem, though.
It's a matter of the heart and the mind.
<Page12>
But it's these differences in feelings
The next romance will be born ...... ......
<Page13>
I feel ...... I feel ......
Right around the corner, I sense a dating event in the air: ......!
<Page14>
Oh, I didn't know Ciel didn't have a dating event.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure what to do.
<Page15>
No, no, no. And that's why this one is not only at night, but also at school.
Don't worry about it.
<Page16>
Tono-kun and I talk 4:6.
I'm better than you.
<Page17>
Hmm.
In any case, it's a long story about the setting of a church, right?
<Page18>
It's much shorter than an explanation of vampire society.
<Page19>
I'm sure you'll understand.
I'm sure you'll agree.
<Page20>
I've been to school too.
<Page21>
I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page22>
I'm not sure what to do.
<Page23>
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
I'm sure you'll be glad you did.
<Page24>
Okay, die!

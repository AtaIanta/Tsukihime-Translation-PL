"That's how it ends."
"That's the way it's gonna end.

"Tell Me!　It's time for "Dr. Ciel".
I, Ecoalc, will be explaining.
<Page3>
And a flower blooming in the corner.
I, Ecoalc, and a flower blooming in the corner, Nekoalc, will be providing the commentary.
<Page4>
So, where did Ciel go?
And what about you?
<Page5>
You're the same as me. ...... I mean.
I know you're a good girl, but ......
<Page6>
I don't know.
It's like we can't recognize each other.
<Page7>
It's like they can't talk to themselves.

You shouldn't break them so easily, you know?
<Page9>
I agree. So, we're not...
We're not like that, right?
<Page10>
Since we don't have much time.
Could you explain the cause of death?
<Page11>
Well, if I'm not careful.
Exaton is going to disappear from this world.
<Page12>
A Cosmo-like pressure cooker?

That's what I mean.
<Page22>
If you can't proceed to the next step, please change your behavior on the ninth day.
Don't take Noel up on his offer.
<Page23>
He's in a bad mental state.

<Page24>
His uncontrollable impulses.
Will lead to a certain tragedy.
<Page25>
Really? Let's see...
I can't wait to see the flowchart.
<Page26>

I chose the senpai of my dreams, so...
Isn't this where the couple is formed and then the ending?
<Page2>
Shikyuu, shikyuu.
Hello, Ciel-kun, come in, Ciel-kun.
<Page3>
Calm down.
I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page4>
I'm not sure what to make of this.
It's just a perfect communication ......
<Page5>
I'm not sure what to make of it.
It's like a broken crane.
<Page6>
I'm not sure what to do.
I'm not sure what to do.
<Page7>
It's good that you want to help those who are in dire straits.
But, you know what?
<Page8>
The first thing to remember is that you are only a rescue target
I want you to keep in mind that
<Page9>
While putting your own safety first
While keeping your own safety in mind, reach out to help as much as you can...
<Page10>
I know it's hard, but that's the limit of humanity.
You can ignore Ciel at this point.
<Page11>
I'll just have to put up with a big bowl of curry.
I want you to help the unreliable office worker nearby.
<Page12>
I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one.
It's not a bad idea to help out .......
<Page13>
I'm not sure what to say.
<Page14>
I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think it's a good idea.
I'm not sure what to do.
<Page15>
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page16>
Ah. But just because I helped you...
Don't make me indebted to you.
<Page17>
Tono-kun is a student and Noel-san is a teacher.
<Page18>
Please keep an appropriate distance.
Please keep an appropriate distance!
<Page19>
Nyahahaha.
<Page20>
I'm just asking for your information, but what if you and Noel get flagged for this?
What if you and Noel get flagged for this?
<Page21>
I'm sorry.　That's what the "Teach me!　Ciel-sensei".
Ciel-sensei" will only be aired once more, right?
<Page22>
Oh, I see. In that case...
"Forgive me!　Ciel-sensei", right?
<Page23>
Since it's Tono-kun's first offense, he'll be punished lightly.
I'll give Noel-san something he can't say with his mouth.
<Page24>
Hmm, I thought it was a training school but it was a prison.
Hang in there Noel, you'll live ......!

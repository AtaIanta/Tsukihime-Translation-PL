I don't care who you are, you're all the same to me.
What?　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
<Page2>
This time, the end is Sister Noel's own decision.
She can't keep her balance when she's alone. ......
<Page3>
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.
<Page4>
Hmm.
What kind of circumstances?
<Page5>
a. I heard Sister Noel's tip-off.
　　The acting priest called the acting Ciel.
<Page6>
b. The substitute Ciel, who went to the sewers alone.
　　learned of Roa's condition and went to the Tono residence to search for her.
<Page7>
It's one of the two.
<Page8>
As for the one in a., the news of the convocation arrived in the afternoon.
It would have been better if he had been in a condition to ignore it.
<Page9>
As for b, I don't have to tell you.
Tono's reticence led to a bad result.
<Page10>
So let's be proactive on this day!
No matter what happens, the tea room, that is!
<Page11>
I see. The weight of Ciel...
It was a good safety valve for Noel.
<Page12>
I'm not sure what to make of that.
I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page13>
I don't know why I let that super torture time pass me by.
I'm sure you'll agree.
<Page14>
It's ...... if you infiltrate the Tono residence alone ......
<Page15>
What if I did?
<Page16>
It was worse than Tono-kun's condition this time.
How about ......?
<Page17>
Stop it! You're not smiling.
How bad is that place?

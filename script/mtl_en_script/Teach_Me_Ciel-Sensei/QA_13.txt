Hello, everyone!
<Page2>
Amidst all the trouble that seems to be pouring in.
In the midst of the troubles that are pouring in, we'll be cheering on Tono-kun as he works his hardest in our popular corner.

Wake up!
Don't wake up, Ciel!
<Page7>
Gosh!
<Page8>
Hmm~~, critical connect.
I'm disappointed that you can't even dodge such a surprise attack.
<Page9>
Did you think that the spring of our world has come?
You're getting a little carried away, Teacher.
<Page10>
It's just when you think you can do it. It's when you think you can do it that you become vulnerable.
It's when you think you've got it all figured out.
<Page11>
I'm sure you're all aware of that.
I'm sure you've all felt this painfully at your live shows.

You can't go near Winter General Vroove
The enemy is always on the move.
<Page13>
The enemy is a rampaging character who's always firing off super specials.
If you land a good blow, they'll leave you alone!
<Page14>
You'll have to fight like a cat!
I'm not sure what to do.
<Page15>
I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
It is true that I was in a state of excitement.
<Page16>

I'm not sure what to do.
He got up within the ten count: ......
<Page18>
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.

<Page19>
Well. I don't want to listen to the cat's nonsense.
I'd like to get to the point.
<Page20>
The cause of this time is that I was overconfident in my power.
<Page21>
Tono-kun is just a normal boy.
No matter how well he's doing, he shouldn't stay in the danger zone for too long.
<Page22>
"I can do it!" That's when you think.
You have to check your own condition as well as the other person's.
<Page23>
I said it.
I already told you that.
<Page24>

<Page25>
I'm not sure what to make of that.
I'm not sure what to do.
<Page26>
It's not only the flames, but also the low temperatures that are a threat to the human body.
I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.
<Page27>
I told you.
I already said that too.
<Page28>
It will lift you up.

After a blow, let's blow it away and get some distance!
<Page30>
Gopaaaaa!
If I could do that, there would be no hardshipーー！！！！

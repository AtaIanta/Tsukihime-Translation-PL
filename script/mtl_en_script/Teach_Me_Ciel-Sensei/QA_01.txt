Hello.
Were you surprised by the sudden dead end?
<Page2>
The rescue corner that leads the lost Tono-kun to the correct ending.
"Tell me!
<Page3>
"Teach me!　Welcome to "Ciel-sensei".
I'm Ciel, your instructor (assumed to be 18 years old after the main story).
<Page4>
Seriously?
The title says "teacher", but how can it be "instructor"?
<Page5>
Well, I don't care about those details.
If you see me, you'll understand what I mean.
<Page6>
Hello, Somly Equine of the bad end world.
I'm NekoAruk, the one who was banned from the main story for being too sexy.
<Page7>
Are you new to this kind of adult corner?
Well, I guess it's your first time, but calm down.
<Page8>
You can ignore this creature if you want.
Basically, just take what I say as a lesson.
<Page9>
Now, let's examine the cause of death this time. ......
<Page10>
It's already burning, isn't it, Glasses?
I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.
<Page11>
I'm not sure what to make of it.
I'm sure you'll be able to figure out why.
<Page12>
Of course, that's because he was seen.
It's because I walked out alone after being seen.
<Page13>
"I can't be in a room with a brainless vampire like that.
　I'm going back to my parents' house!"
<Page14>
I understand that feeling, but
But you have to be patient.
<Page15>
Even though you've been dragged into this.
I'm not sure what to do.
<Page16>
Until the immediate enemy ...... vampires is dealt with.
You can't go home!
<Page17>
Once you're out...
You still had one last chance, didn't you?
<Page18>
Would it be better to go back to the hotel then?
I think it's best if you go back to the hotel.
<Page19>
But if you go back to the hotel after you've escaped ......
It is embarrassing if the heroine's sensitivity is lowered and ......
<Page20>
I'm not sure what to make of it.
I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page21>
I'm not sure what to make of it.
I don't care what you say, it won't lower your sensitivity!
<Page22>
Eh? I don't think that's true, but nya~?
I do get angry when I'm angry~?
<Page23>
But you know... when you're yelling...
But you know, when you're yelling, I can't get over how desperate you look.
<Page24>
Look at me.
Aren't you aware of your love brain?
<Page25>
Even if it's the same heroine, she acts cool until the end.
I want you to learn from the heroine who lives for her work.
<Page26>
What?
(Which side are you on? )
<Page27>
Eh?
(What kind of reaction is that? )

<Page1>
It's not only the hero who faces a dead end.
It's not just the hero who gets a dead end, but also the heroine.
<Page2>
It's truly a fair story.
And so...
<Page3>
The heroine who met the second dismantling end
Let's have a comment from the heroine!
<Page4>
Yes, Alquaid-san, please!
And congratulations on your next route's heroine!
<Page5>
---You're a tutor with no class.
Still, are you aware of being the holder of ■■■■?
<Page6>
---What?
Ah, um, who are you, ......?
<Page7>
Where is that cat-like creature?
It's a substitute for Alcade, isn't it, that thing?
<Page8>
...... I'm disappointed.
Not only is she dull, but she's not very intelligent either.
<Page9>
That creature is not her alter ego.
It is not a messenger.
<Page10>
It's just a flicker, an urban legend that has been misinterpreted and
It's just a jargon that has started to walk on its own.
<Page11>
If you want my opinion on her fate.
I can think of no one more qualified than that creature.
<Page12>
Not to mention, me.
After all, I'm not a stranger.
<Page13>
---No, no, no.
<Page14>
The cat-like creature that was here earlier...
Not the Alcade of this corner. ......
<Page15>
Yes. In this world.
Alcade Brunstad is me.
<Page16>
It costs a great deal of money to appear in the "image of the future" like you.
It costs a lot of money to perform.
<Page17>
So I've kept the cost to a minimum.
I'm going with an image of the past.
<Page18>
...... That's right.
<Page19>
It's an eco-alcade.
You can call it Eco ALC.
<Page20>
Eco-Alk: ......!
<Page21>
So that cat-shaped creature
So that cat-shaped creature doesn't appear anymore?　Yuck!
<Page22>
You should be disappointed there.
Basically, I rarely show up.
<Page23>
After this, and for all time to come...
Dr. Ciel's opponent is that creature.
<Page24>
Huh, I see. ......
Thank you for your hellish future pronouncement .......
<Page25>
But then why?
I don't know.
<Page26>
After all, it's not like he's a jerk to Tono-kun.
Is it one of your protests?
<Page27>
---I guess so.
I'm not sure what to make of that.
<Page28>
Not only did I lose to ...... lust.
I can't believe I can't even take care of myself after I'm broken.
<Page29>
Even now that I've come out this way, I can't contain my disdain.
I'm so angry ...... no, I'm beyond angry, I'm pitiful.
<Page30>
So, Dr. Ciel.
I have a request.
<Page31>
Yes, yes!
What's that? What's that? ......
<Page32>
If you have to fight that thing.
I'm not sure what to do.
<Page33>
If you don't suffer thoroughly once.
It seems that you can't become a lady.
<Page34>
What?　You don't have to tell me to take it easy on Alcade.
I'm not going to go easy on Alcade...
<Page35>
Huh?　Could it be that the person that Ecoalc is angry with...
The one you're angry with...
<Page36>
I'll leave you to it then.
Please continue to take care of him.
<Page37>
You're an unreliable tutor, but...
I trust you as much as I trust my shelves.
<Page38>
Well, ...... what does that mean?
<Page39>
Late, late, late!
Cat, I'm back at the speed of light!
<Page40>
Yes, it's the speed of light, so it will overtake you for oversleeping and
I'm not sure what to make of this.
<Page41>
Oath, good morning Ciel-kun!
This morning, you look like a subheroine, and that's fine!
<Page42>
By the way, didn't you see me here just now?
<Page43>
I'm not sure what to make of it.
I'm not sure what to say.
<Page44>
No one who fits that description has come here.
That's right...
<Page45>
What would you like to be punished for being late?
Kakei, Matasaki, Hikikuruma, Iron Maiden......
<Page46>
We have a wide variety, so
Please make a request.
<Page47>
I'm sorry. I'd like to see the same thing as Alcade.
Do you prefer to be cut up and bleed to death?
<Page48>
Don't bring up a word I've never heard before.
The only one with a dead end is you, Glasses.
<Page49>
Yeah.
<Page50>
I'm serious, India!
You're going to be executed just for being late, or have you finally shown your true colors?
<Page51>
No, no, no. I didn't really mean it either, but...
But I've been asked to do something.
<Page52>
It seems that the story is about to reach its climax.
I think I'm going to change the lead here.

Have you gotten used to sudden deaths by now?
<Page2>
I did my best, but I died in vain.
Tono-kun.
<Page3>
"Teach me!　Ciel-sensei".
We're off to a great start this time too!
<Page4>
But this is just a common choice of three deaths, right?
It's just going back to the previous choice and starting over, right?
<Page5>
What's a rescue corner?
You're supposed to save them before they die.
<Page6>
You know, I just realized something.
<Page7>
I just realized this... we're going to see how Glasses dies.
And we're just going to comment on it?
<Page8>
What?　Yes, but what about it?
<Page9>
I mean, you can't learn something without it hurting, right?
<Page10>
Hmm~, it was a doess that passed through Sparta.
<Page11>
Now, the cause of this time is the 'night' school.
Tono-kun alone in the 'night' school.
<Page12>
I don't even have a senior I can rely on.
I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page13>
Go back to the previous option.
You should go back to the previous option and choose a bloodier place!
<Page14>
Now?
Did you just say "just now"?
<Page15>
Ciel, the perfect heroine.
Do you know why the perfect heroine escaped?
<Page16>
She was about to run out of stamina so she rushed home.
Or something like that?
<Page17>
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
<Page18>
Well, you didn't realize you were a vampire.
That you're a vampire?　After all this time.
<Page19>
You know, since you were rampaging through the garage of the dead.
You couldn't stand it anymore, right?
<Page20>
Seriously, you had a slight fever before that?
Ciel doesn't stand a chance anymore?
<Page21>
Are you okay?　Do you want to go back to your hometown?
<Page22>
India isn't my hometown or anything!
<Page23>
That's more important. Just because it's your route...
Just because it's your route doesn't mean you should get carried away.
<Page24>
It's not just Tono-kun who'll die instantly.
It's not just Tono-kun.
<Page25>
Did you just say it suits you?
<Page26>
As long as the story continues, there's always the possibility of anyone leaving.
Alcade is not an exception.
<Page27>
Eh~?
There's no way that there's a chance that she'll lose from here.
<Page28>
All that's left is a touching ending, right?
Even a newborn mike can understand this.
<Page29>
Huh.
Then, what if that doesn't happen?
<Page30>
I'm not sure. Niboshi...... no.
You can even put the heroine of the next route on the line, man!
<Page31>
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure what to make of it.
<Page32>
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
<Page33>
That's it for "Sayonara!　Nekoaruk Sensei"!
That was the corner~!

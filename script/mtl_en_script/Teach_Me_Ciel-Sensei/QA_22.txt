I'm not supposed to be here, but...
But since both Ciel-sensei and the cat were blown up.
<Page2>
You can start over right before this end as well.
It's two instant death type choices.
<Page3>
I want to end that phenomenon as soon as possible, even if it's just for a second.
You can skip this section and go back to the main story.
<Page4>
.............
<Page5>
.............
<Page6>
You don't want to skip ......, do you?
It can't be helped.
<Page7>
This is the last time you will see this corner.
I'll give you a little service.
<Page8>
That's the "light body" ...... that appeared in this city.
It's Alcade run amok.
<Page9>
The glowing body is a planetary initialization system.
This can't be called that anymore.
<Page10>
I'm sure you've heard of it.
It's just a love monster. That's it.
<Page11>
...... I'm sorry for my language. Forget about it.
<Page12>
The length of this thing is...
When the system occurs, it is 200 meter class.
<Page13>
It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
I'm sure you've heard of it.
<Page14>
That's why it's swelling up through the building.
That's why it swells up through buildings.
<Page15>
When it is stable, its length is fixed at 100 meters.
This is to match the level of civilization around it.
<Page16>
The volume ...... and weight cannot be measured.
<Page17>
In this way, it has mass.
It is a form of the Earth's life force.
<Page18>
If I had to put it another way, I would say that the mass of the earth is its weight.
Therefore, no matter what action you take on the earth
"It's not heavy for the earth.
ã€€Therefore, no matter what action you take on the earth, "it is not heavy for the earth, so the terrain will not be damaged by the weight.
<Page19>
The ground will not cave in. The ground will not cave in.
However, this does not apply to man-made structures.
<Page20>
Incidentally, the millennium castle disappeared because
I'm sure you've heard of it.
<Page21>
In the state of the true ancestor of the "light body", the materialization of the imagination
I'm sure you'll agree.
<Page22>
The greater the output, the less able she is to construct detailed fantasies.
The more output she has, the less detailed her imagination can be.
<Page23>
The only thing she can do in her "light body" state
I'm not sure what to do.
<Page24>
I'm sure you've heard of it.
Geothermal manipulation, atmospheric manipulation...
<Page25>
It's a natural threat. And this.
<Page26>
"consciously directed.
"as a conscious, directed thing.
<Page27>
"unconsciously, as a reaction.
And now she can only use it as a reaction.
<Page28>
Which is the better life.
You can judge which is better for life by your own taste.
<Page29>
Although .......
<Page30>
This bad end she is.
It's not the "light body" I know.
<Page31>
She's a system, but she's also a self.
It shows signs of putting the self and emotions first.
<Page32>
And yet, she doesn't collapse out of control.
It is changing into a new "vessel".
<Page33>
When something that was a system becomes an individual
I don't know what kind of impossibility will occur.
<Page34>
I've seen dead ends, bad ends.
I've seen a lot of endings, but ......
<Page35>
This is one world end.
In a way, it's probably the worst end.
<Page36>
So don't worry about her.
Relentlessly, thoroughly...
<Page37>
You can expect such a counterattack.
I expect such a counterattack from you.
<Page38>
So long.
Someday again, in a dream that should not exist.

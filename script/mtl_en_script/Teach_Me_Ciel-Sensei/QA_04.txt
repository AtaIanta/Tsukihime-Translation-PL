Ooh, Dead Aand!
<Page2>
Tono-kun there!
You've been cited for speeding! You've been cited!
<Page3>
Why does this Ciel look so happy?
There's also the hero who's getting barbecued, you know?
<Page4>
Excuse me. Now that the real battle has finally begun.
I was so excited that I went to .......
<Page5>
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one.
<Page6>
Welcome to "Teach me!　Welcome to "Ciel Sensei"!
<Page7>
Depending on your play, this may be your first
This is the first dead end of the game.
<Page8>
It's such a natural choice, you know?
It's a natural choice, this one.
<Page9>
But let's calm down and check the situation carefully.
Humans can't live in flames!
<Page10>
Well, cat-wise.
I appreciate the dead end.
<Page11>
I mean, there's a beautiful woman fighting right in front of me.
Who can keep their cool? Here's a phrase.
<Page12>
"A chestnut in the fire is a picnic.
　Welcome, welcome, welcome, welldone."
<Page13>
What do you think?
Does it whet your appetite, mademoiselle?
<Page14>
No, I don't know what it means at all. ......
Well, I'm a hard-boiled meat person. ......
<Page15>
Oh, is that so, Nya?　I'm surprised.
You're French, but you can't have steak that drips blood?
<Page16>
The best beef curry meat is tender.
I'm not a fan of raw meat ...... physiologically.
<Page17>
It's rare,......, or maybe it's the fact that they prefer it alive.
I think it's probably Akiba.
<Page18>
I'm sure you'll agree. I'm not sure what to make of that.
It's incredible.　Unbelievable.
<Page19>
Baka, the fresher the fish, the better.
<Page20>
I think you're lying.
Next time I'll buy you a round of sushi.
<Page21>
You like flounder, don't you, Otaku?
<Page22>
...... That's because I don't eat the same menu every day
It's not like I'm eating the same thing every day. ......
<Page23>
Seafood is also a good choice sometimes. ......
<Page24>
I'm not sure what to make of that.
I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you. We'll have dinner afterwards.
<Page25>
Oh, yeah.
I was in the middle of a class.
<Page26>
Well, anyway, vampires fighting other vampires is dangerous.
Anyway, vampires fighting vampires is dangerous, so let's just keep a cool head and watch from afar.
<Page27>
Don't worry. I'm sure Tono-kun's turn will come.
Please save your strength until then!
<Page28>
---Yes, your work is done!
Then we're going straight to Messiaen!
<Page29>
...... the choice of seafood curry......!

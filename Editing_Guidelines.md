# Editing guidelines

In this document, we define some semantic, syntaxic and and grammatic guidelines concerning the speech patterns of some *Tsukihime Remake* characters that Nasu wrote specifically to be *excentric*, be it in speech or behavior, compared to others. That's is why it is particularly important to try to convey as much as possible their quirks in english.

The first general rule guiding your translation/editing should always be to try to convey meaning and atmosphere over exact structure. More precisely, you should always try to stick as close as possible to japanese for the structure of the sentence and the vocabulary used, unless a direct translation is not possible. This can be due in particular to unique idioms or references, to some vernacular grammatical or syntaxic element or to Nasu *unconventional*, to say the least, use of furigana/ruby. In this case, you must prioritize the precise meaning, feeling and emotion conveyed by the sentence over the exact same structure: when the player reads a sentence said by a fancy character, he should wonder **WHY** the character is saying it rather than **WHAT** the sentence means.

This is a <u>difficult exercise</u>. Whenever you're unsure of what to do with a particularly complex sentence, the best course of action would be to collect as much raw information as possible from the Japanese sentence and then ask for help in the #editing channel, so the other editors can think together on how convey what should be <u>conveyed the best</u>.

Now, let's go over more practical guidelines for specific characters.											

## Noel

Noel tries to sound *young* and *appealing*, and at the same time a bit provocative, sometimes seducing. To convey this character, we will use a vocabular and grammar that can be sometimes a bit slangish or colloquial (e.g. "ain't", "Nah", etc.), we'll do heavy elision of words when necessary, but not too frequently (e.g. "y'know", etc.) and a bit provocative general tone. 

Once she switches personality (going for the *nun mode*) she will not use elisions at all.

**<u>Sample sentence</u>**: "Huh? What's up with this atmosphere? Everyone suddenly froze up.. What's that, I'm a Basilisk woman? # Nah, the metaphor ain't clear, is it. Erm, in proper japanese, I'd be that TV haunting girl? But Sensei's name isn't Sadako y'know" (*filename 02_00_ARC02_1_1, page 6, line 2941*)

## Arihiko

Arihiko is a thug, but he's the usual clich√© of the goofy thug with a golden heart helping the protagonist. In order to convey this and not to overstep Noel's speech pattern, we will use in his lines funny or weird idioms/expressions (they can be a bit old for example, or he can have an off-beat style), but a the same time some cursing ("what the hell", etc.) and sometimes elisions.

**Sample sentence**: "Tohno's picking up chicks? What the hell is going on? I thought you weren't interested in 'em." (*original VN*)

## Dr. Arach

Dr. Arach is a complete weirdo, and something of a *mad biologist*. Conveying her speech is probably the most difficult, but here are some guiding principles: she expresses herself in a very bombastic way, i.e. using exaggerations and a refined vocabulary ("Oh, sublime sugar!"), and sometimes she does biological/medical comparisons, and in this case we have to make these parts overly serious. The idea is to induce burlesque/surreal humor by creating a mismatch between the technical parts and the bombastic parts.

**Sample sentence:** "Oooh, sublime sugar! You're pervading all five of my senses! You're even making my uterus and my ovaries melt.. I feel it coming! Haah.. Thanks for the meaaal!" (*filename 02_00_ARC02_1B, page 39, line 2802*)



## Other characters

Here are some general specificities for other characters

### Contractions

Depending on the situation, we will use contractions ("I'll", "They're", etc.) for the following characters:

- Shiki
- Arcueid
- Ciel
- Mio
- Saiki
- Satsuki
- All other students and teachers

We will not likely use such contractions for the following characters:

- Akiha
- Hisui
- Vlov
- Roa

For these characters, it will really depend on the situation:

- Kohaku
